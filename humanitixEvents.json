  "description": "Nick Tomlin\u2019s talk, Leading from Within: Servant Leadership Through the Lens of PTSD Recovery, shares a powerful account of how living with PTSD has deepened his understanding and practice of Servant Leadership. By weaving personal experience with leadership insight, he illustrates how vulnerability, empathy, and resilience are not signs of weakness, but powerful tools for healing and leading authentically.\nThe session encourages leaders to embrace authenticity, support mental well-being, and foster cultures rooted in trust and service. Key points include:\nUnderstanding Servant Leadership and how it differs from traditional authority-driven models\nHarnessing vulnerability to build trust and psychological safety within teams\nSustaining resilience while navigating personal and professional adversity\nCreating supportive cultures where mental health is valued and people can thrive as their full selves\nIt\u2019s a compelling reminder that leadership is not about having all the answers\u2014it\u2019s about leading with heart, especially through the hard chapters.\nAbout Nick Tomlin\nBorn in Kent, England in 1968, [Name] served 25 years across the British Army and Royal Air Force, rising from Combat Medical Technician to Special Forces Commander of the Light Surgical Group. His deployments took him from Northern Ireland to Afghanistan, and he also proudly represented his service in rugby, cricket, and Ironman events.\nFollowing retirement, he became Medical Manager for the London 2012 Olympics before emigrating with his family to New Zealand. Today, he channels his energy into resilience coaching and mental health advocacy, drawing on personal experience after a post-service diagnosis of PTSD.\nWith gratitude for the support of his wife Fay, their two sons, and the SPARTA Project, he now speaks openly about invisible wounds, the power of vulnerability, and his mission to help others find hope and healing\u2014proving that true strength lies not in silence, but in connection.\nAbout Results Coaching\nFounded in 2011, Results Coaching (formerly Setanta Consulting), is one of New Zealand\u2019s fastest growing coaching practices. Our promise is to expand the horizons of our clients measured by observable growth through coaching and training events. As one participant put it, \u201cThis is the type of talk I\u2019m looking for at my stage of my career, i.e. focuses on personal development rather than technical skills.\u201d\nPlease Note: We may photograph or record the event for promotion purposes and may reproduce the image of any person who attends for any purpose without payment."
