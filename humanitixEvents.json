    "description": "Nick Tomlin\u2019s talk, Leading from Within: Servant Leadership Through the Lens of PTSD Recovery, shares a powerful account of how living with PTSD has deepened his understanding and practice of Servant Leadership. By weaving personal experience with leadership insight, he illustrates how vulnerability, empathy, and resilience are not signs of weakness, but powerful tools for healing and leading authentically.\nThe session encourages leaders to embrace authenticity, support mental well-being, and foster cultures rooted in trust and service. Key points include:\nUnderstanding Servant Leadership and how it differs from traditional authority-driven models\nHarnessing vulnerability to build trust and psychological safety within teams\nSustaining resilience while navigating personal and professional adversity\nCreating supportive cultures where mental health is valued and people can thrive as their full selves\nIt\u2019s a compelling reminder that leadership is not about having all the answers\u2014it\u2019s about leading with heart, especially through the hard chapters.\nAbout Nick Tomlin\nBorn in Kent, England in 1968, [Name] served 25 years across the British Army and Royal Air Force, rising from Combat Medical Technician to Special Forces Commander of the Light Surgical Group. His deployments took him from Northern Ireland to Afghanistan, and he also proudly represented his service in rugby, cricket, and Ironman events.\nFollowing retirement, he became Medical Manager for the London 2012 Olympics before emigrating with his family to New Zealand. Today, he channels his energy into resilience coaching and mental health advocacy, drawing on personal experience after a post-service diagnosis of PTSD.\nWith gratitude for the support of his wife Fay, their two sons, and the SPARTA Project, he now speaks openly about invisible wounds, the power of vulnerability, and his mission to help others find hope and healing\u2014proving that true strength lies not in silence, but in connection.\nAbout Results Coaching\nFounded in 2011, Results Coaching (formerly Setanta Consulting), is one of New Zealand\u2019s fastest growing coaching practices. Our promise is to expand the horizons of our clients measured by observable growth through coaching and training events.

    "description": "Next-Level BA: How to maximise your value-add\nA half-day workshop for Business Analysts looking to take things to the next level.\nWhat this course isn't...\nThis isn't about your traditional 'BA' skills - we won't be learning to write better requirements, user stories, or processes!\nWhat this course is...\nThis is a course focused on a mindset shift (with the tools to back it up) to enable you to add more value as a BA. As projects become more ambiguous and agile, the expectations on a BA are changing in a way gives us the opportunity to make a bigger impact - if we have the skills to take advantage...\nWorkshop scope:\n0. Intro / \u2018Next-Level BA\u2019 definition\nLearn what makes a \u201cNext-Level BA\u201d \u2013 someone who jumps into projects early, stays focused on outcomes, regularly steps back to see the bigger picture, acts with purpose, and takes the initiative to lead. This introduction pushes BAs to move beyond the limiting \u201cI\u2019m just a BA\u201d mindset and embrace a more proactive approach that doesn\u2019t require formal authority to make an impact.\n1. The evolving role of a BA\nSee how the BA role has changed from working on clearly defined, waterfall projects to handling small, ambiguous initiatives with constant change. We\u2019ll look at how design now happens alongside build, how BAs wear multiple hats, and why organisations need BAs to be leaders who can handle uncertainty rather than just task-executors. Understand the difference between working \u201cin\u201d versus \u201con\u201d a project to maximise your value.\n2. Setting up good decision-making in a project\nDevelop ways to establish what success looks like from day one of any project. This practical framework drives better outcomes by creating alignment, building trust, and enabling smarter decisions throughout the project. You\u2019ll create your own set of ready-to-use success criteria that you can bring out in workshops to guide projects toward meaningful outcomes rather than just outputs.\n3. Defining the pathway for problem solving\nGet to grips with \u201cdefinedness\u201d \u2013 understanding where your project sits on the spectrum from well-defined to highly undefined problems. Build a playbook for tackling different types of problems, knowing when to use existing approaches, when to adapt them, and when to create new ones. This thoughtful approach buys you time while you learn more about complex problems and increases your chances of success.\n4. Ensuring the right things are being worked on\nGo beyond \u201cI delivered what I was asked to\u201d and make sure you\u2019re not just doing things right, but doing the right things. Create a practical checklist to assess whether initiatives will truly add value, address root problems, and align with what the business can actually implement. Learn to question scope consistently and push back when necessary to avoid wasting time on projects that won\u2019t deliver real benefits.\n5. Risk tolerance / ensuring you are adding value\nFind the sweet spot between risk and cost by knowing when you\u2019ve gathered enough information to proceed. Avoid analysis paralysis by tailoring your approach based on who will be affected, what systems are involved, how easily changes can be reversed, and your organisation\u2019s history with similar work. Design approaches that reduce the impact of mistakes, allowing for faster, more cost-effective decision-making.\n6. \u2018Selling\u2019 in the decision-making process\nBuild a clear approach to influencing decisions through effective storytelling. Learn to establish the need for change, reinforce what success looks like, address potential barriers upfront, present your solution convincingly, and provide a clear path forward. Create decision-maker profiles to help customise your approach to different stakeholders based on whether they focus more on the journey or destination, respond to emotion or logic, and other key characteristics.\n7. Other potential stumbling blocks (plus how to look after yourself!)\nUnderstand that projects don\u2019t exist in isolation \u2013 organisational culture, maturity, history, and competing priorities all affect your ability to deliver. Learn to assess these factors systematically and adjust your approach accordingly. Recognise your circles of influence and control to protect yourself from burnout when facing organisational barriers that can\u2019t be changed, accepting that some challenges simply can\u2019t be overcome!\n8. Recap\nBring together all aspects of being a Next-Level BA, committing to consciously developing and applying these skills in your work. Remember that while these concepts aren\u2019t complicated, deliberately putting them into practice will significantly improve your effectiveness and impact as a BA.\nWho's the workshop for?\nThis course is designed for experienced Business Analysts. If you are used to working \u2018in\u2019 projects but are ready to take more control in shaping them, then this is the perfect course for you!\nWhat will you get out of the course?\nYou will walk out of this workshop with some genuinely practical skills to help put you in a leadership position within a project environment (shaping the approach, and course that the project takes). \nCourse structure\nThe course will run 1:00 \u2013 5:00 with afternoon tea provided.\nVenue\nVenue is Urban Hub - Level 4 (Kent) meeting room."

If you're interested in attending this event and would like to be on the wait list, please contact us at info@littleandloud.co.nz.\nWe\u2019re living in a world where AI adoption is outpacing AI literacy.\n\nGlobal research shows that three in four employees say they\u2019re using some form of AI at work.\nOf these, over 50% say that they hide their AI use on important tasks, and up to 80% say that they are bringing their own AI to work.\nMore people are using AI, without understanding how it works, without telling their employers that they are using it, without considering the implications, and without knowing how to get the most from the tools they\u2019re using.\nThis is where AI literacy becomes essential - it\u2019s not just knowing how to use AI tools, it\u2019s about understanding what\u2019s possible, and knowing you don\u2019t need to be technically savvy to use it well.\nThis practical two-hour in-person workshop is for real people in real businesses; who want to use AI to do more with the resources and tools they already have.\nYou\u2019ll learn:\nWhat AI actually is, where it\u2019s heading, and why it matters for every kind of business\nThe best tools for things like admin, planning, performance, content, customer service, and strategy \u2013 and what to avoid\nHow to use AI responsibly: the risks, red flags, and how to keep it ethical\nHow to \u201ctrain\u201d AI to sound like you and reflect your business, not bland templates\nStep-by-step ways to save yourself hours each week, without sacrificing quality\nHow to onboard AI into your organisation, and avoid spending hours setting up new tools\nWhy mindset is everything \u2013 and how early adopters are getting ahead fast.\nThis workshop is built for:\n\u2714\ufe0f Both AI beginners and curious dabblers\n\u2714\ufe0f Business owners and operators\n\u2714\ufe0f SME teams across any sector: retail, trades, services, health, education, not-for-profit, and more\n\u2714\ufe0f Anyone who\u2019s been avoiding AI or feeling overwhelmed by the hype.\n\nYou\u2019ll walk away with:\nA clear, practical understanding of how AI works and how to use it\nProven tools tailored for small businesses\nPlug-and-play workflows to save time and reduce mental load\nConfidence to use AI without compromising your brand, your values, or your people.\nNo tech jargon. No hype. Just real-world tools, clear explanations, and fresh thinking for busy people in any business.\n*2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report from Microsoft and LinkedIn\nDon\u2019t just take our word for it\nPeople from all over the country have attended our AI workshops. Check out some feedback below.\n\u201cLoved it, great balanced presentation, lots covered but the pace was good.  Very different to other tech-based presentations without all the 'show-off jargon'.  Lizi was passionate but realistic and gave the pros and cons.  An intentional and thoughtful presentation, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cYou made such a daunting topic so easy and clear to understand and navigate.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for a fantastic session this morning.

    "description": "With local elections fast approaching this October 2025, what is being done to achieve a #GenderEqualNZ within our political systems?\nIn the 2022 local government elections, only 38% of candidates were women. Despite this being an increase from previous years, significant structural and cultural barriers persist for women seeking to enter and remain in politics.\nFrom issues around childcare to gender-based violence to stereotypes in the media, women experience hostility at all levels of the political sphere. Several women in local government across the country spoke with Breakfast in April, sharing the hateful comments they\u2019ve received online, with abuse and violent threats often spilling into the real world.\nSo how do we encourage more women into political leadership, and what needs to be done to keep them there?\nThe Wellington Branch of National Council of Women New Zealand, in collaboration with Graduate Women Wellington and Zonta Club of Wellington, are hosting The Annual Women\u2019s Debate 2025 to discuss this question.\nThe event will be hosted by award-winning journalist and broadcaster for RNZ, Susie Ferguson. She'll be joined by a stellar line-up of women:\nSusan Freeman-Greene, Chief Executive of Local Government New Zealand\nTory Whanau, Mayor of Wellington City\nAfnan Al-Rubayee, senior public servant and community leader\nRebecca Matthews, Wellington City Councillor\nThis year\u2019s Annual Women\u2019s Debate will focus on the experiences of women from across the political spectrum and the gendered obstacles they have faced in politics. Furthermore, the debate will explore what is being done to address barriers to women\u2019s political leadership, and how women representatives can empower a #GenderEqualNZ.\nLight refreshments will be available from 5:30pm before the debate starts at 6:00pm."

The outcome will be a map which identifies areas where we need to install nodes to give coverage across the CBD. These could become mission-critical to reaching loved ones in the event of an earthquake or blackout event. We will meet at Critical Signals, 115 Taranaki Street, then head out into the city, rain or shine."

The lecture will position self-hosting as an act of infrastructural resistance and reclamation in an era of pervasive digital imperialism and extractivism.\n  The talk will also assess free and open source platform alternatives to Big Tech, from cloud, to webmail, forum, team chat, and more."

However, local infrastructure, from cell towers, to datacentres and fibre networks, remain unscathed. What could (or couldn't) we do with what we have? What of our current network and communications infrastructure, and all our most used sites and services, would function when we\u2019re \u2018cut off\u2019 from the rest of civilisation?\n  Join us in a playful lab environment helping build the first \u2018map\u2019 of what our digital experience would look like if it was just us - from healthcare, to education, banking and the big socials. In doing so, we\u2019ll get a sense of just how infrastructurally independent \u2013 and resilient \u2014 we are as a nation.\n  Participants will learn how to use simple network probing and website analysis to pull websites and networks apart, looking under the hood at just how much is hosted overseas.\n  This is a team effort, with no prior knowledge required. Participants should bring a laptop."

    "description": "It keeps getting more expensive to heat our homes and water, cook our meals and get around. But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Levin will show you how.  \nMost Levin homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nLevin has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Levin.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Levin is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives."

    "description": "This workshop is for EVolocity students or those interested in our program for Years 7 - 13. \nExplore electronics & programming and learn how to build a dashboard for your EV.\n\nOur Arduino programming experts will take you through a step-by-step tutorial on building and programming your Arduino-based system monitor for your own electric vehicle. Our Tech Team have been hard at work developing new Arduino workshop content and hardware, which is intended to be much more concise, and more useful to teams who are wanting to get a foot in the door with programming and data-related electronics. For Open Class teams, you must monitor the temperature of lithium batteries as per the rules, and everyone will leave the Arduino workshop with a working temperature monitoring system. This workshop is essential for those using lithium batteries.\nWHAT WE WILL COVER\n\u2022 Understand what an Arduino is and how it works\n\u2022 Learn how to use an Arduino safely, and how to program your Arduino using code you've written\n\u2022 Begin making a dashboard for your electric vehicle to provide performance data\n\u2022 Along the way, you will learn valuable programming constructs such as variables, conditionals, loops etc\nIf this is new to you, you won't be alone! No experience is necessary.\nARDUINO KIT\nIf you are attending the workshop, you will need to purchase a kit. The kits will be provided at the workshop and you'll be sent an invoice following the event. Kits are $45+GST. If you aren\u2019t intending on coming along to the workshop but would like to purchase a kit, please let us know.\nWHAT TO BRING\nThere is a chance that the University computers may have driver issues, so as a back up, students are to bring their own computers. The programming software is free, and please ensure this is installed and tested in advance. THE REQUIRED SOFTWARE DOES NOT RUN ON CHROMEBOOKS. Please download Arduino IDE 2 (the one at the top of the page), and ensure you are using a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. There may be some devices available on the day for those who do not have a device. You can download the Arduino Guidebook and Example Sketches here. The booklet steps you through the connections and programming, and the example sketches are what you will work from during the workshop.\nPlease bring a snack and a drink bottle.\nLocation\nUpper Hutt College, Engineering Workshop Room T2, Theory Room T6.\nParking\nFree parking available on site.\nContact\nSchool Co-Ordinator / Annabelle Batchelor / 027 4100 633 / annabelle@evolocity.co.nz"

    "description": "STEAMS is an integrated approach to learning topics of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths, and Society that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. Its aim is to teach real world skills through engaging methods whilst allowing individuals to be creative. This involves immersing tamariki into projects and activities that develop innovation and champion curiosity. STEAMS is not \u2018play based learning\u2019 but focused learning through an integrated hands-on approach allowing children to take risks and explore their own curiosity in a subject without time barriers.\nAt the Ministry of Inspiration we offer STEAMS learning each term for Year 1-8 students. Once a week students will attend a class at Waterlea Racecourse, Blenheim on TUESDAY or THURSDAY. STEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) start at 9am and finish at 2:45pm on TUESDAY. Little STEAMerS operates from 12-3 on TUESDAY. STEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) operates on THURSDAY from 9am to 245 pm. We qualify as an off-site learning programme which enables schools to record the students as \u201clearning offsite\u201d rather than absent for that day.\nInquiry, collaboration, and an emphasis on process-based learning are at the heart of the STEAM approach. Each term the classes will have a focus which drives the learning and our amazing teachers create opportunities to help each student develop their understanding, improve their skills and gain knowledge in a range of topics.\nStudents who participate in STEAM learning:\n\u00b7 think outside the box\n\u00b7 feel safe to express innovative and creative ideas\n\u00b7 feel comfortable doing hands-on learning\n\u00b7 take ownership over their learning\n\u00b7 work collaboratively with others\n\u00b7 understand the ways that science, maths, the arts, and technology work together\n\u00b7 become increasingly curious about the world around them and feel empowered to change it for the better.\nWhen does it meet, and where?\nThe school is held during school terms.\nSTEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) TUESDAY, 9-245.\nSTEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) THURSDAY, 9-245\nLittle STEAMerS (ages 5-6) TUESDAY 12-3.\nLocation:  Waterlea Racecourse, enter off of Linton St.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe students come for a paid three-week trial-as a new student you pay for that through Humanitix.\nIf both family and teacher feel there is a good fit for the child in the class, they continue for the rest of the term. You are then invoiced for the full term less the amount paid for the Trial.\nPayment is by term, with a cost of $63 per day plus GST. We have a limited number of scholarships available that are awarded on a term by term basis for those with financial need for 25% off. \nLittle STEAMerS is $25 per day plus GST.\nWill my child\u2019s school mind that they miss a day per week?\nYou will need to inform the child\u2019s school that he or she will be at STEAMS School one day per week. To date we have not encountered any issues around accommodating a child\u2019s participation in STEAMS School, and many of the region\u2019s schools are very supportive of the programme. Once enrolled, you are encouraged to inform the teacher and office staff that your child should be marked present for the day they attend STEAMS School, as they will be attending an academic school as opposed to being absent due to illness or other reasons."

He showed how this energy can be absorbed freely into the body, and through his teaching many people were cured back then as today, even from diseases that are considered incurable.\nNumerous medically documented success reports demonstrate the current effects of his teaching. These success reports have been proven and documented within the Medical Scientific Group \u2013 a world-wide forum of independent medical doctors, psychologists and health care professionals within the Bruno Groening Circle of Friends.\nOur Information Lecture is open to all interested people.

    "description": "Join us for an immersive workshop  that bridges ancient indigenous traditions with cutting-edge neuroscience to explore the powerful intersection of cacao, psychedelics, and spiritual transformation.\nIn this workshop, you will discover the rich history and sacred significance of cacao in indigenous cultures, focusing on its use in ancient Peru. Learn about the temples, tribes, tools, and symbols associated with cacao, as well as its role in shamanic rituals. We will delve into the cosmovision that links cacao with psychedelic plant medicines and how these ancient practices are integrated with modern scientific understanding.\nKey Highlights:\n-The Sacred Role of Cacao: Explore the origins of cacao in the ancient temple of Montegrande and Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar, Peru, key sites of shamanic initiation dating back over 7000 years. Shamans used ceremonial cacao to connect with the divine and combined it with San Pedro cactus to induce visionary experiences.\n-Cacao & Neuroscience: Understand how ceremonial cacao influences brain chemistry and supports spiritual awakening and neuroplasticity. We'll discuss the latest neuroscience research on cacao\u2019s ability to facilitate transformational change and rewiring of the brain.\n-Cacao Personality Mapping: Through biochemical mapping, we have developed a \"Cacao Personality Map\" to help you tailor your cacao experience to your personal needs, whether for healing, insight, or emotional clarity.\n-Integrating Tradition & Modern Science: Learn how ancient practices are validated and enhanced through contemporary neuroscience, and discover how cacao can be a tool for deep inner work and to enhance both mental and physical health.\n\nIf you\u2019re passionate about cacao and curious about its transformative potential, this workshop  will expand your understanding and deepen your connection with this sacred plant. Whether you\u2019re a cacao lover or a seeker on a spiritual path, this experience will open your mind to the possibilities cacao holds for healing, awakening, and change.\nDate: Wed 30th Jul 2025, 7:00 - 9.00 pm NZST\nLocation: Commonsense Wellington, 147 Tory Street\nTickets: Book online from $5-15 (ultra early bird - late pre-sales)\nExtras: Get 10% off all Seleno Health products after the event and a free sample cup of a creamy ceremonial cacao elixir during the workshop.\nPresenter:\nDr Corin Storkey (PhD \u2013 Med Chem) has over 20 years of academic and research experience, specialising in understanding how plant medicines interact with the brain and body.

    "description": "Join us for an immersive workshop  that bridges ancient indigenous traditions with cutting-edge neuroscience to explore the powerful intersection of cacao, psychedelics, and spiritual transformation.\nIn this workshop, you will discover the rich history and sacred significance of cacao in indigenous cultures, focusing on its use in ancient Peru. Learn about the temples, tribes, tools, and symbols associated with cacao, as well as its role in shamanic rituals. We will delve into the cosmovision that links cacao with psychedelic plant medicines and how these ancient practices are integrated with modern scientific understanding.\nKey Highlights:\n-The Sacred Role of Cacao: Explore the origins of cacao in the ancient temple of Montegrande and Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar, Peru, key sites of shamanic initiation dating back over 7000 years. Shamans used ceremonial cacao to connect with the divine and combined it with San Pedro cactus to induce visionary experiences.\n-Cacao & Neuroscience: Understand how ceremonial cacao influences brain chemistry and supports spiritual awakening and neuroplasticity. We'll discuss the latest neuroscience research on cacao\u2019s ability to facilitate transformational change and rewiring of the brain.\n-Cacao Personality Mapping: Through biochemical mapping, we have developed a \"Cacao Personality Map\" to help you tailor your cacao experience to your personal needs, whether for healing, insight, or emotional clarity.\n-Integrating Tradition & Modern Science: Learn how ancient practices are validated and enhanced through contemporary neuroscience, and discover how cacao can be a tool for deep inner work and to enhance both mental and physical health.\n\nIf you\u2019re passionate about cacao and curious about its transformative potential, this workshop  will expand your understanding and deepen your connection with this sacred plant. Whether you\u2019re a cacao lover or a seeker on a spiritual path, this experience will open your mind to the possibilities cacao holds for healing, awakening, and change.\nDate: Tuesday 29th Jul 2025, 6.30 - 8.30 pm NZST\nLocation: Commonsense Kapiti - Coastlands\nTickets: Book online from $5-15 (ultra early bird - late pre-sales)\nExtras: Get 10% off all Seleno Health products after the event and a free sample cup of a creamy ceremonial cacao elixir during the workshop.\nPresenter:\nDr Corin Storkey (PhD \u2013 Med Chem) has over 20 years of academic and research experience, specialising in understanding how plant medicines interact with the brain and body. He holds a PhD in medicinal chemistry from the University of Melbourne. He has previously overcome chronic fatigue syndrome and promotes an integrative and holistic approach to managing chronic health conditions. He currently leads the New Zealand based Andean/Amazonian plant medicine research program that studies ancestral plants and substantiates their traditions through biochemical analysis."

    "description": "The English Locust is the folk/blues solo project of Wellington musician Jim Bailey. The English Locust describes his sound as \" Bob Dylan if he was goth\", fusing the melancholy poeticism of groups like the Smiths and Joy Division with the musical stylings of folk and Delta Blues.\n Jim is a veteran of the Wellington Music scene, holding a bachelor's degree in commercial music. His previous band The Vermillion Poets, placed second in the national New Zealand battle of the bands in 2019 where he also won an award for best vocalist. With his current group SHE, he has released three singles to critical acclaim from NZ Music.net and was the organiser for their festival SPECTRE FEST for two years. With his solo project The English Locust, he was a regional finalist in this years Battle of the bands, being the only soloist to make it that far in this years competition. He plans to release his debut single late 2025 or early 2026. \nAnt\u00fc M\u0101rama is a musical collaboration between Paulette Mankoch Soriano (Chile), Jim Bailey (UK) Claudio (Chile), Andres del Vilar (Chile), David (Canary islands) and Catherine Ireland (NZ). The band evolved from a previous incarnation, The flying jaranas, who played primarily Son Jarocho, a traditional music from Veracruz on the East Coast of Mexico. Since then, members have come and gone, and Ant\u00fc M\u0101rama has broadened its horizons to play folk music from all around Latin America, as well as original compositions written by lead singer Paulette. The group's ethos is represented by the name - Ant\u00fc is the Mabudungun word for sun, while M\u0101rama is the Te reo M\u0101ori word for Moon. The group combines both the life-giving energy and vitality of the sun with the deeper emotions and more reflective energy of the Moon. Ant\u00fc M\u0101rama is a synthesis of the group's diverse backgrounds and musical experiences, united by a love of playing music, and a desire to share the rich folk tradition of Latin America with a local audience."

    "description": "The next concert in our series presents a new project by Dave Wilson titled Free, Free: Meditations on Liberation. This project brings together a collective of musicians from across the music communities of P\u014dneke in an invitation to explore the expansive possibilities for what liberation might sound like.\n\nFree, Free draws from legacies of musical collectivity, and celebrates a commitment to both collaboration and the distinct expression of each individual.\nRanging from contemplative minimalism to ecstatic ensemble energy and body-moving grooves, the music of Free, Free invites musicians and other listeners to tend to each moment, making their own offerings to shape the collective sound.\n\nDave Wilson is a saxophonist, clarinettist, composer, producer, and interdisciplinary scholar. His music bridges avant-garde and experimental music with various groove-oriented styles from the worlds of jazz, R&B, electronic music, and more.\n \nWith his 2023 album Ephemeral, described as \u201cquite spiritually intense music\u201d by The Guardian, he was a finalist for Te Manu Taki Tautito o te Tau | Best Jazz Artist at the Aotearoa Music Awards, and for the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award. Before relocating to Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington in 2016, Dave grew up in the Chicago area, lived for a decade in Los Angeles, and spent several stints living in Skopje, North Macedonia.\n \nFree, Free: Meditations on Liberation\nDave Wilson, Tyaan Singh \u2013 alto saxophone\nLouisa Williamson \u2013 tenor saxophone\nMonique Lapins, Mana Waiariki \u2013 violin\nKen Ichinose \u2013 cello\nKaito Walley, Natania Ngawhau \u2013 trombone\nBen Hunt \u2013 trumpet\nDaniel Hayles, Andrew Faleatua \u2013 piano and keyboard\nPhoebe Johnson \u2013 bass\nCallum Allardice \u2013 guitar\nHikurangi Schaverien-Kaa \u2013 drums\n\nThe performance will begin with an opening set by Flute Journeys, an offbeat mass flute ensemble with the self-described playing abilities of 5\u201312-year-olds, embodying a form of liberation in music.\n\nThe Jazz Orchestra Composer Series showcases original music for large jazz ensemble by New Zealand composers. Concerts take place every 1st and 3rd Friday of the month, from May to October, from 7pm. Tickets are $15, door sales $20.\nThanks to CNZ for their generous support."

Written by band members Tess Luff, Elena Saunders and Ellie Stewart, this group of talented musicians invite you into contemplative corners of their brains with a set of gentle and jovial numbers that will entertain and delight.\nThey will be joined on stage by their friends the Bidibids.\nAbout Hihi & The Stitchbirds:\nHihi & The Stitchbirds are an exciting five-piece musical experiment, based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Pairing rich vocal harmonies with vibrant original music inspired by the folk and Americana playbooks, this band brings something for everyone.\nHihi & The Stitchbirds are:\nElena Saunders - vocals and vibes\nChris Goldsbury - guitar, clarinet and vocals\nTess Luff - guitar, banjo uke and vocals\nMatt Hutton - bass uke and vocals\nEllie Stewart - fiddle and vocals\nAbout the Bidibids:\nWith lush harmonies, intricate arrangements, and beguiling melodies, the Bidibids explore what it means to play folk music in New Zealand. The Bidibids are Sarah August on banjo and guitar, Simon Carryer on cello-banjo, and Brendan Schenk on mandolin and guitar. The trio came together at the 2020 Wellington Folk Festival, where they were each supposed to be playing in different groups. Since then, the Wellington-based band have become regulars at some of the region\u2019s best venues for folk music, including the Mussel Inn, Moon, and the Wellington Bluegrass Society.\nDriven by Sarah\u2019s honest, intimate songwriting and Brendan\u2019s blazing musicianship, the Bidibids balance soulful ballads that will tug your heart-strings with upbeat numbers which will get your toes tapping. Influenced by American bluegrass and folk bands like Watchhouse and Nickel Creek, they\u2019re also inspired by local acts like the Eastern and Marlon Williams who are forging an authentic New Zealand folk tradition. You can listen to the Bidibids' debut EP here: https://open.spotify.com/album/6Q8HW5g0FzDl3VYz44OZU5?si=4gIRmfaRSiOUlgxJnVUbuw."

Strictly limited tickets so book early to avoid disappointment.\nEnjoy an amazing night with legendary blues artist Darren Watson.

Since then, he has pursued a successful solo career, releasing a series of well-received albums. His 2020 album, Getting Sober for the End of the World, was widely praised for its sharp social commentary and musical craftsmanship, earning airplay and accolades both locally and internationally. It saw Darren nominated as a finalist for the 2021 Aotearoa Music Award for Best Folk Artist.\nWatson's new album 'Darren Watson sings John Hiatt' is due for release in late 2025."

The session has been crafted musically, leaning on deep drones from Paiste gongs and other instruments that harmonize together in layers, rather than loud, crashing strikes of the gong. Nick considers the nervous system throughout, giving you an experience of 'dropping' into deeper brainwave states through the form and gentle introduction.\nThe sound of the session is more like contemporary ambient music using acoustic instruments than traditional Eastern music, and positive feedback has included: feeling extremely relaxed, to having psychedelic imagery, to processing old memories. You never know what might happen, so its about just being open to the experience.\n$35 per person with limited tickets/spaces!"

Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years. She directed One Night Band which won 'Most Original Production' at the Wellington Theatre Awards 2023, and performs regularly as both a player and musician for POPROX.\nISAAC THOMAS has been an improviser and improv musician for a decade in P\u014dneke and Whakat\u016b/Nelson. He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2025. We'll giveaway any spots remaining a few days before the first workshop of the course, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email poproximprov@gmail.com and we'll pop you on the SBL. Everyone on the list will be notified whether there was a place available for them 3 days before the first workshop."

Each reading will be followed by a 30 minute chat with the writer, facilitated by the director. It's an exciting and creative way to develop new work, both for writers, who receive feedback at an early stage, and for audiences who get to water the seed from which the fruit will eventually grow.\nWe will also be hosting an industry workshop led by Playmarket, leading a conversation on opportunities, processes and accessibility for new playwrights. Playwrights will need to register for this free workshop which has 20 spaces.\nThe whole event is NZSL interpreted. Accessible to blind/low vision folks without audio description.\nYou can check out the program for more details of each play, content notes and pre show information, but here's a quick glance over the weekend.

Shit-for-brains liberals peddling \u2018both sides\u2019 fucknuggetry as the people march for peace and their governments pour gasoline on fire. And wt actual f is a \u2018lesser\u2019 evil? Sameena Zehra is back to explore whether it's time to dust off your guillotines (even for a pacifist, it\u2019s definitely time) with dark comedy & delicious storytelling that will make you gasp and guffaw as you channel your inner homicidal pacifist to pen a culling list of your own.\nFollowing a sold out season at NZ International Comedy Festival earlier this year, Sameena is bringing this show back for one night only during TAHI festival as part of TAHI Encores season.\nContent Notes\nThis show is accessible to Blind or Low Vision folks without audio description.\nThe venue is fully accessible. \nNo loud noises or flashing lights. I will occasionally raise my voice, but will avoid shouting.\nAdult, political, and other confrontational content (see title). \nAlso... coarse language, because... lalochezia (look it up).\nSome direct chat with the audience- however, if you avert your eyes or shake your head, I will not speak directly to you.\nQueer friendly.\nSameena Zehra is an award winning comedian, storyteller, actor, writer, director and blues singer/songwriter. She is a political satirist, an intersectional feminist, and a humanist. Her humour is dark and her mind is absurd, equally at home exploring the individual experiences of daily life and the larger issues of the world we live in, creating work that is rooted in the human condition, in holding power to account, and in bringing people together in spaces that are tender and robust. She has performed her solo shows all over the world, including Edinburgh Fringe, Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Brighton Fringe, Adelaide Fringe, The Nordic Fringes, and New Zealand Fringe, where she was nominated for 'Best In Fringe' 2016, and won 'Outstanding Performer' in 2017. Before moving to Aotearoa New Zealand in 2019, Sameena lived and worked in the UK where she has performed at the National Theatre, and has toured internationally with the Royal Shakespeare Company. She performed the critically acclaimed season of her show 'Tea with Terrorists' at Circa Theatre in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, (which was nominated in the \u2018Outstanding Performer\u2019  and \u2018Best Director\u2019 categories at the Wellington Theatre Awards) before touring it at festivals around Aotearoa.\nHere's things people have said about shows Sameena has made...don't take them too seriously, it's just individuals, with individual opinions. You might have different ones (but you'll have to come to the show to find out)\n\u2018Astonishing, and frequently violent... \u2019 The Independent, UK (That's a particularly good one)\n\u2018Outstanding...a master storyteller\u2019 Rip It Up, Adelaide\n'Funny, fiery, brave and true.\u2019 Herald, Scotland\n\u2018Humour in every strand\u2019\n\u2018Left wanting the next chapter\u2019 The Latest, Brighton\n\u2018...an intimate atmosphere with all the warmth, energy and enthusiasm of a full house at the Apollo\u2019\n\u2018Fluency, intensity and vivacity... \u2019The Age, Melbourne\n\u2018...combines warmth with political passion.\u2019 Scotsgay\n\u2018... smart and sharp... a breath of fresh air... \u2019 Nicholas Holm, The Post, NZ\n\u2018 ... the wittiest and sassiest lady I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of watching.

Willum is thrilled when Rick shows up unexpectedly for his 39th birthday, but his delight quickly fades as Rick is a hopeless nerd \u2013 a bumbling idiot with no social sense, little emotional intelligence, and even less tact.  Rick moves in and stays on and on, his continued presence among Willum and his friends creates unimaged chaos, until the normally placid Willum can no longer take it and he and his friends devise an insane plan to finally get Rick to leave.\nDon\u2019t miss this hilarious farce that ran on Broadway for 441 performances and went on to be performed the world over.\nPerformance dates: 12 & 16-19 July 2025, 7.30pm, Muritai School Hall, Eastbourne"

    "description": "Laidlaw Centre for Church Leadership exists to love and serve the Church of Aotearoa New Zealand by providing her leaders with the tools, support, and guidance they need to flourish. \nJoin us for a one day conference as we gather with leaders from across the region to connect, be inspired and encouraged, and discuss issues relevant to the Church in Aotearoa. The event runs from 9am to 2:30pm. Morning tea and lunch is included.\nTheme: Stewarding Renewal\nOur 2025 Leaders Days explore emerging reports across New Zealand and the globe of increasing openness to faith in Christ, and in some cases significant growth in church attendance and baptisms, led by younger generations; and how church leaders might respond.\n\"In churches across society something amazing is happening, challenging long held predictions about the future of Christianity in the twenty-first century. Where we once saw ageing congregations and a steady decline in attendance, we now see dramatic growth, led by the young. Where we once saw apathy or even hostility to Christianity and the Bible we see increased openness.\" - Bible Society UK\nIn the United States a similar trend is emerging:\n\"Undeniably there is renewed interest in Jesus,\" says David Kinnaman, CEO of Barna. \"This is the clearest trend we've seen in more than a decade pointing to spiritual renewal \u2014 and it's the first time Barna has recorded such spiritual interest being led by younger generations.\" - Barna Group, USA\nOn Easter Sunday in New Zealand, St Patricks Cathedral in Auckland baptized 350 people. Testimonies are emerging from churches across Aotearoa of an openness to faith, responses from people previously not interested in church, and a curiosity about Christ and Christianity among non-believers, particularly young people.\nAs church and Christian leaders in Aotearoa New Zealand, how might we respond in our contexts?\nHow could we participate in what the Spirit is doing? What does this mean for sustainability of people and programmes, and for our discipleship teams? How can we discern the best response to the opportunities presented by this context? How can we stir hunger for renewal in our time and place, without unhealthy comparison?\nWe are gathering leaders from across Aotearoa in four locations for a one day conference to discuss these questions. There will be opportunity to hear testimonies of renewal happening in churches in Aotearoa, and share your thoughts with other leaders as we gather \u2014 we pray you will walk away encouraged, inspired, and with fresh vision for the days ahead.\nWe hope to see you there!\nProgramme:\nSession One: Emerging Renewal\nMore and more, stories are emerging of green shoots in surprising places: tales of people without church backgrounds turning up at church quite unexpectedly, more frequent conversations with those curious about Jesus, dramatic spiritual encounters that we could never have facilitated. There is a sense that the upheaval of Covid, global political shifts, and financial uncertainty in recent years has shifted something: the fragmentation and failure of secularism and new atheism was perhaps preparing the ground. It seems like something is happening - a quiet renewal.\nWhat does this mean for the communities we lead? How can we, as leaders, steward these firstfruits of renewal? How can we lean in to what the Spirit is doing in our own contexts?\nSession Two: Stories of Renewal\nIn this panel discussion, local pastors and leaders share stories of how they are seeing that God has been moving \u2014 stirring renewal and hope, unexpected shifts in discipleship and salvations, and how they are responding.\nSession Three: Renewal and Fruitfulness\nTime and time again throughout history, renewal has come through small communities making radical commitments to the way of Jesus. What can renewal movements throughout history teach us about renewal in our own moment? What helps? What doesn't? What does it look like to be faithful in our time and place?\nSession Four: Renewal Conversations\nWhat does it look like to steward renewal in our churches? This session focuses on practical responses to renewal and discussion around how the Church in Aotearoa can partner with what the Spirit is doing.\nSpeakers:\nSam Harvey, 24-7 Prayer New Zealand\nSam Harvey is the founding and Lead Pastor of Bay Vineyard Church and the National Coordinator for 24-7 Prayer NZ. He has been in full-time ministry since graduating from BCNZ (now Laidlaw) in 2003. He is passionate about coming alongside church leaders to encourage strong prayer cultures in churches. His 24-7 role gives him a front row seat to a lot of what God is doing among our churches. Sam is married to Jenn and they have three lively sons. Sam loves good food, good music and good waves. We are excited to have him with us!\nRoshan Allpress, Laidlaw College\nDr Roshan Allpress has led Laidlaw College as National Principal/Chief Executive since 2017. He holds History degrees from Canterbury and Oxford, focusing on religious reform, philanthropy, and theology\u2019s social impact. He co-founded the Compass (now Venn) Foundation and has extensive experience in non-profit leadership. Raised in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, he and his wife Lottie have three children and now live in Auckland.\nLocal Panels\nIn each location we will be joined by local pastors and leaders sharing experiences of renewal from their contexts.

But we wouldn't want to overload you with too much exposition, huh?\nAnd before you scoff at its oddities, don't worry, Urinetown's already laughing at itself with jokes like \"Wee-wee never fail.\"  But beyond its potty humour and absurd premise, Urinetown: The Musical, unveils itself with its political messages that also satirises the musical genre. From a gospel number to a climax that references Les Mis\u00e9rables, it dazzles at the same time as it depresses.\nSo-- come and watch. If not for the comedic choruses, then for the capitalistic commentary. The musical reminds us, as much as we can laugh at the central conceit of the show, we're not so far from the songs it's singing. \nOriginal music and lyrics by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis (2001); performed by Tawa College.\""

Don\u2019t miss this opportunity to hear from one of New Zealand\u2019s leading researchers - this promises to be a fascinating and thought-provoking evening. \nProfessor Richard Beasley CNZM FRSNZ, the 2024 Rutherford Medal winner, will highlight ten influential research programmes that have challenged long-held clinical assumptions, advanced medical knowledge, and directly influenced patient care:\nShould fever be treated?\nWhat is the optimal amount of oxygen for critically ill patients?\nAre party pills safe, and do they affect driving performance?\nDoes smoking cannabis cause lung cancer?\nIs sitting for long periods at work or during recreation a risk factor for blood clots?\nShould preservatives be included in asthma nebuliser solutions?\nIs \u2018watchful waiting\u2019 preferable to surgery for a collapsed lung?\nWhat are the underlying disease processes of asthma?\nWhat was the cause of the epidemic of asthma deaths in New Zealand?\nAre adult asthma treatments suitable for children?\nThe answers to many of these research questions were unexpected. The research raises significant regulatory and legal issues. It also exposes the limited evidence of the benefit and safety of many fundamental approaches to the clinical management of common disorders, and the gaps in knowledge, particularly in children.\nJoin us for this fascinating presentation that will illustrate the unpredictable nature of research and its influence to reshape our understanding.\nBiography\nProfessor Richard Beasley, renown academic, physician, and researcher, is the founder and director of the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand (MRINZ). Richard is committed to challenging medical dogma and increasing knowledge through undertaking high quality clinical research which has the real potential to change clinical practice and reduce the burden of disease in Aotearoa New Zealand and globally.\nAlongside his role at the MRINZ, Richard is a physician at Wellington Regional Hospital, and maintains close academic links through his professorial appointments at the University of Southampton, UK, Te Herenga Waka\u2014Victoria University of Wellington, and the University of Otago. Richard was Deputy Chair of the Health Research Council of New Zealand from 2010 to 2016 and has had a longstanding medical advisory role with the Asthma and Respiratory Foundation of New Zealand, chairing the adolescent and adult asthma guidelines group. He is dedicated to workforce training, having supervised and mentored hundreds of medical research fellows over the last three decades, many of whom obtained postgraduate MD and PhD degrees and now hold prominent academic and clinical positions in Aotearoa New Zealand and around the world.\nRichard is one of New Zealand\u2019s most experienced clinician researchers, with over 780 publications, including many high impact publications in the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. Richard was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to medical research in 2008; elected a Fellow of the Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi of New Zealand in 2015; awarded the Sir Charles Hercus Medal in 2016 in recognition of the impact of his research, the Beaven Medal in 2019 in recognition of his translational research, and was awarded the Rutherford Medal by the Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi in 2024 for revolutionising the treatment of asthma worldwide.\nSeats are limited, so book early to avoid missing out.\n\nSupported by Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi and the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand (MRINZ)"

    "description": "\u201cSEARCHING FOR IDENTITY\u201d\nBy Claire Bruell\nDesign & Production by Mike Reganon\n\"This is your history, these are your stories, my gift to you.\" These are the last words in Claire Bruell's four-book series to future generations - her \"five beautiful grandchildren\", Simon, Sofia, Lily, Nate, and Isaac.\nBut more than a gift to her grandchildren, these books spell out the trauma Jews have faced over millennia and, through her resolute and gently probing of the Bruell and Briess family trees over four generations, she exemplifies the lives of so many. Jews around the world will identify with the tragedies and joys, the uplifting and the horror, the sheer delight and abject gloom.\nCarefully moulded over four books, Claire describes these stages and reveals the lives of her ancestors as they grow and achieve success, have wonderful families, meet catastrophe, are split asunder, murdered by Nazis, and finally regather the remnants to rebuild - a story so familiar to Jews who have only sought peaceful coexistence for centuries.\nClaire will describe aspects of the process of creating that content from age 32 through to today, and with Mike, will speak about some of the features of working together and the exquisite joy of laying it all out on paper.\nClaire Bruell\nClaire is a historian particularly interested in 19th-century Europe and the Holocaust. Her interests span history, genealogy, reading, collecting curios and ex libris, and from time to time she speaks and writes on many of these subjects. She has been a Justice of the Peace for 30 years and the coordinator of an oral history project in Auckland for almost as long. Her days are focused on family and community.\nMike Reganon\nMike is a retired teacher, journalist, editor, designer, and publisher. He has dabbled in pottery, sculpture, printing, oil painting, and renovating the family home, a lifetime occupation. Today, he continues his clay creations by joining a local pottery group and has begun learning Yiddish using Duolingo. As those skills improve, he hopes to find others keen to practice the mamaloshen, but right now he\u2019s farshmakht.\nImportant Update\nTo ensure the continued delivery of our high-quality speaker series, we've transitioned to a paid model. Your support is crucial in maintaining the excellence of our events and speakers. Unlock invaluable insights at our upcoming L'Dor V'Dor single session for just $10*.

You can find out more about the Love Rimurimu project, and meet the team working to restore the seaweed of Wellington's harbour. \nWhat\u2019s Love Rimurimu? Imagine the waters of Wellington sustaining a healthy and vibrant ocean forest; able to absorb more carbon than trees, improving water quality and providing habitat for thousands of marine creatures. Regenerating our seaweed forests is a way to make this a reality - and it\u2019s what this project is all about.\nInterested in volunteering with Mountains to Sea Wellington? Come along and we can have a chat about opportunities available- our volunteers help us on land and in the water, we'd love for you to join us! \nSeaweed Series: This event is part of a series of events introducing folks to the seaweeds/rimurimu of Wellington. No previous knowledge or experience is necessary to take part in these events, just a bit of seaweed curiosity!\nIf you want to leave with one of our beautiful waterproof underwater guides these can be bought for $15 on the day, or download for free on our resources page.\nLearn more about Love Rimurimu: www.loverimurimu.org/background"

But since we're so busy in the doing, we don't often have the time or ability to take a full day off from work to dedicate to learning new things.... and sometimes conferences can be hit and miss on content.\nLast year we created a Leader Learning & Doing Day, where you can come and co-work in the same space as a bunch of other founders and leaders, and also go to mini unconference sessions during the day that are set by you. You share/learn/discuss the things that matter to you most - with other folk that are going through it. We had sessions ranging from how to use AI in your org, founder transitions, and even a photographer taking new head shots for folk. \nThe price of the ticket covers a koha to the venue and for some coffee/snacks. You can choose to come to all the sessions, or just one or two of them, and you'll have access to coffee and wifi throughout the day. \n\nBelow is our plan for the day:\n9:30am - Arrival & coffee\n9:45am - Welcome, Introduction round & Agenda Setting\n10:30am - Session 1\n11:30am - Session 2\n12:30pm - Lunch\n1:30pm - Session 3\n2:30pm - Farewell/head out for a drink (or home - you choose!)\nCo-hosts\nAnna Guenther - helps Kiwi fund the things they care about.

The visit is strictly limited to 15 places, so get in quick!\nConstructed on behalf of Greater Wellington and Wellington Water, the new pipe bridge replaces a seismically vulnerable section of bulk water pipeline that supplies all of Porirua City and North Wellington.

Here\u2019s some of the great stuff we\u2019ll cover.\nTrust yourself. Change the way you think and feel about yourself.\nDeal with challenges. Become more resilient whatever life serves up.\nLead authentically. Become the sort of leader who helps others take up space too.\nGo for your dreams. Learn how to go after what you want in life.\nA fun day of laughter and connection for anyone who wants to explore how they can take up more space in the world. Be less apologetic and less self-conscious. Feel confident knowing you can stand comfortably anywhere you choose.\n9:00am start\nLunch included\n3:00pm finish & head for a drink\nEveryone welcome. No more of this diminutive bullshit. Take. Up. Space.\n\nMove past self-doubt into self-confidence\nWe\u2019re running this workshop because we meet so many people hiding away, playing small, not standing in their full power.\nAnd it breaks our heart that so many people can\u2019t see how brilliant they are.\nPartly that\u2019s because in New Zealand it\u2019s a bit dirty to be proud of yourself. We say fuck that. But often it\u2019s more. Maybe people who should have backed you cut you down and you\u2019ve internalised their BS ever since.\nBut that\u2019s enough. It\u2019s time to take up space.\n\nTicket price\n$299 + booking fee\nEveryone welcome. Lunch included.\nMeet your irreverent badass hosts\nMiraka (Shelly) Davies\nDescribed as the lovechild of Bren\u00e9 Brown and P!nk, aged 37, Shelly walked away from her family\u2019s five-generation commitment to conservative Christianity and started the exploratory period of her life, also known as \u201cfucking shit up.\u201d A people pleaser in recovery, she infiltrates organisations on the pretext of giving writing training and subverts teams to question the rules, while using her hard-won lessons in badassery to inspire you to know yourself, love yourself, find power, and have joy.\nBelinda Thomas\nThe Veuve Cliquot of the professional development world, with a bag of Bluebird chips on the side, Belinda is expert in the neuroscience of success but gives few fucks about corporate bluster. Growing up on a Hawkes Bay sheep farm, she\u2019s as comfortable sitting at a boardroom table as she is having tequila shots off the back of a ute at your local A&P show. She\u2019s raised two amazing humans, taught Shelly to swear, has an intimate relationship with her boat, and lives to give mediocrity the bird."

    "description": "Join us for an Ecstatic Dance and Sound Journey to raise vital funds for Mahmoud Al-Madhoun and his family, who are from Northern Gaza.\nMahmoud shares four children with his wife, Nour. They have a baby girl named Omnia (age 1), and three sons, Team (3), Ahmed (7) and Faiz (11). Omnia and her mother, Nour, were evacuated from Gaza via ambulance during the last ceasefire, before hostilities resumed. Unfortunately, Mahmoud and Omnia\u2019s three big brothers were denied evacuation. Thus, the boys remain in Gaza with Mahmoud, where things are painfully difficult. Like all Palestinians, they are struggling to survive and the hardships just keep intensifying.\nUpon arrival in Cairo, Omnia had to wait weeks for open heart surgery, a life saving treatment that she required at birth. With Gaza under constant bombardment, Omnia was unable to have surgery once her parents learned of her condition shortly after her birth.\nMahmoud and Nour have lost everything, their house, their livelihoods, and have been forced to evacuate multiple times, all while managing the complexities that come with supporting a child with difficult medical needs. Their suffering has been further exacerbated because of them being separated, meaning Mahmoud was unable to support his daughter and wife during surgery. No parent ever should be forced to endure such dire and heartbreaking circumstances.\nThis event is a call for community, compassion, and action \u2014 every dollar raised will go directly to help Mahmoud provide basic necessities and rebuild a sense of safety and hope for his family.\nLet\u2019s come together in movement and music to support this family in their time of urgent need. Your presence and contribution can truly make a difference.\nMeet the Team:\n\nKellie Smith\u2014 Sound Ceremonialist\nKellie is a sacred space holder and sound practitioner. She completed her Master\u2019s degree in Criminology in 2012, specialising in genocide and international humanitarian law. She draws upon her professional background and experience in trauma support work, blending themes of collective consciousness and justice into her sound offerings.\nShe brings deep love and wisdom into every tone and vibration she channels. Her sound frequencies and crystal-clear presence invite you into a realm of deep remembering, restoration, and renewal through the power of sound.\nLisa Schady \u2014 Voice of the Sacred\nLisa Schady is a captivating performing artist known for curating transformative spaces using her powerful voice and intuitive mic presence. With deep reverence, she guides participants through emotional landscapes with safety and intention. If you\u2019ve ever stepped into one of her temples, you\u2019ll know\u2014Lisa creates sacred containers where what\u2019s alive within can rise and be felt.\nAndrzej \u2014 Musical Mystic\nAndrzej is a musician extraordinaire whose ecstatic dance sets are a journey in themselves. With a rich tapestry of tribal beats, global rhythms, and soul-stirring melodies, he\u2019ll guide us up, in, through, and out\u2014awakening the body, stirring the spirit, and inviting pure, embodied expression. His music opens portals to presence, joy, and freedom. Offering an expansive celebration of dance and movement in the name of peace.\nSaxon Brazier holds a Diploma in Music and Event Management. Deeply moved and conflicted by the ongoing genocide in Gaza, she has spearheaded this kaupapa as a way to turn anguish into action\u2014organizing efforts to raise funds and awareness in support of a family\u2019s urgent journey to safety."
