  "description": "For most current technology, it is assumed that the user is always online and has access to unlimited data.\nBut this assumption is only valid for regions with the infrastructure to support the internet.\nAs more vital communications and services transition into websites, how do we make sure that these services are still usable in areas with only low bandwidth internet or during natural disasters?\nIn this event we will start a discussion about developing smaller websites for accessibility in Aotearoa.\nAbout the host Vic Roberts is a computer vision scientist who works with machine learning in medical imaging."
