  "description": "Justice for Palestine and Aotearoa Healthcare Workers for Palestine present Alexandra Dols' award-winning documentary about the impacts of dehumanising violence on Palestinian people. This screening is intended to provide an antidote to the inflammatory anti-Palestinian programming decisions of Doc Edge.\nIn an environment where language of 'objectivity' and 'neutrality' is used to prop up colonial structures, we are proud to screen a documentary that refuses to buy into this framing. Embark on a journey across Palestine alongside Palestinian psychiatrist Dr. Samah Jabr and discover the resistance and resilience of a people affected by the invisible wounds of war and occupation.\nCheck out the trailer here.\nNet revenue from tickets and donations will be donated to the Gaza Mental Health Foundation: https://www.gazamentalhealth.org/\nArrive from 5.30pm for a 6pm start.\nFilm is 1 hour, 53 minutes so will finish approximately 8pm, including welcome and introduction.\n\"The film is brave because it does not claim to be \"balanced\" through positioning itself an equal distance from the occupier and the occupied of Palestine. Instead, it sheds light on the Palestinian experience and point of view: experiences and views which are usually silenced, distorted, or vilified by mainstream media. The film does not turn away from people who are labeled \"controversial\" and thus to be avoided and ignored. This film brings together a diversity of interviewees whose strong voices do not fade into an all-too-common passive submission to power and dominance. The interviewees differ ideologically among themselves yet a reunited in their striving for liberation.\"\nDr. Samah Jabr\n\u201cDr. Samah Jabr is a wise and thoughtful woman. She reflects on the subtle, devastating effect on the Palestinian people of years of brutal occupation. Alexandra Dols\u2019 film shares her insights with us, generous, humane and deeply disturbing. Please see this film.\u201d\nKen Loach"

  "description": "The next concert in our series presents a new project by Dave Wilson titled Free, Free: Meditations on Liberation. This project brings together a collective of musicians from across the music communities of P\u014dneke in an invitation to explore the expansive possibilities for what liberation might sound like.\n\nFree, Free draws from legacies of musical collectivity, and celebrates a commitment to both collaboration and the distinct expression of each individual.\nRanging from contemplative minimalism to ecstatic ensemble energy and body-moving grooves, the music of Free, Free invites musicians and other listeners to tend to each moment, making their own offerings to shape the collective sound.\n\nDave Wilson is a saxophonist, clarinettist, composer, producer, and interdisciplinary scholar. His music bridges avant-garde and experimental music with various groove-oriented styles from the worlds of jazz, R&B, electronic music, and more.\n \nWith his 2023 album Ephemeral, described as \u201cquite spiritually intense music\u201d by The Guardian, he was a finalist for Te Manu Taki Tautito o te Tau | Best Jazz Artist at the Aotearoa Music Awards, and for the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award. Before relocating to Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington in 2016, Dave grew up in the Chicago area, lived for a decade in Los Angeles, and spent several stints living in Skopje, North Macedonia.\n \nFree, Free: Meditations on Liberation\nDave Wilson, Tyaan Singh \u2013 alto saxophone\nLouisa Williamson \u2013 tenor saxophone\nMonique Lapins, Mana Waiariki \u2013 violin\nKen Ichinose \u2013 cello\nKaito Walley, Natania Ngawhau \u2013 trombone\nBen Hunt \u2013 trumpet\nDaniel Hayles, Andrew Faleatua \u2013 piano and keyboard\nPhoebe Johnson \u2013 bass\nCallum Allardice \u2013 guitar\nHikurangi Schaverien-Kaa \u2013 drums\n\nThe performance will begin with an opening set by Flute Journeys, an offbeat mass flute ensemble with the self-described playing abilities of 5\u201312-year-olds, embodying a form of liberation in music.\n\nThe Jazz Orchestra Composer Series showcases original music for large jazz ensemble by New Zealand composers.

  "description": "Experience Kim Churchill Live \u2013 For the First Time Ever in New Zealand!\nBeloved for his soulful storytelling and breathtaking live shows, Kim Churchill is finally bringing his dynamic sound across the Tasman. This marks Kim\u2019s debut tour of Aotearoa, and you will have the rare opportunity to witness his mesmerizing performances in intimate venues around the country. With his unique blend of folk, blues, and layered acoustic textures, these shows promise to be unforgettable nights of music, heart, and connection!\nNovember 30 @ St Peter's Village Hall, Paekakariki\n2:30pm doors / 3:00pm start\nOver the past 12 years Kim has achieved some incredible things as a professional musician. He\u2019s recognised as much internationally as he is in Australia, having performed headline shows, festivals and supports alike all over the planet. Notable performances include Glastonbury, Splendour in the Grass, Falls Festival, Montreal Jazz, Telluride Blues, and supports with Milky Chance, Billy Bragg, Michael Franti and Nahko and the Medicine People,\nKnown for his magnetic, dynamic stage presence, Kim unites lyrical artistry with fierce vocals; he is a sonic architect \u2013 using his guitar to create landscapes, which animate his lyrics. Don\u2019t miss your chance to see Kim Churchill up close, as he delivers the full force of his artistry \u2013 weaving raw emotion with technical brilliance and passion. Whether you\u2019ve followed his journey from afar or are discovering his music for the first time, this tour is set to be a celebration of song and spirit from one of Australia\u2019s most compelling live performers.\nA Message From Kim\nI feel like I\u2019m just beginning. Which is strange because for the last 15 years I\u2019ve been living in the back of a camper van playing gigs and chasing this crazy dream. I grew up in a small town on the east coast of Australia called Merimbula. We\u2019re mainly known for Surfing, Oysters and Whale Watching. I started busking at local farmers markets when I was 15 and had a fake ID so I could play some pubs around my area. I set off in a van straight after high school to chase my dreams and surf my way across the country.\nIn that first year I was lucky to win the Byron Bluesfest Busking comp and became Folk Artist of the Year and the National Folk Festival. This led to some incredible adventures to Japan, North America and Europe. I busked all over the world and bought 2 more camper vans on different continents. I have three now and each year I fly between them playing festivals and seeking the far corners of world and all the beautiful places I can play music I was lucky enough to become good friends with Billy Bragg from England early on and he taught me a lot about longevity and living as an artist for the long haul. He took me across America, Canada, Europe and England In a tour bus for a whole year and we played Glastonbury Music Festival together. After that time, I wrote a song called \u2018Window to the Sky\u2019. It was on an album called \u2018Silence/Win\u2019 which really helped me step up a few notches. I signed major record deals with Warner, Atlantic Records (UK) and Universal (Europe). \u2018Window to the Sky\u2019 was the most played song on triple J at that time and it went on to be 42 in the Hottest 100 and is Platinum in Australia, Gold in Canada and Germany .and has over 50 million streams!\nI manage myself these days and am at the wheel of this beautiful ship. I have amazing people around the world who have become dear friends over the years and help me on my path. But I\u2019m so so proud to be an artist in control of my own journey. Big thanks to Billy! for setting such a fine example\nA few years ago, I started waking up before Dawn and creating a little sunrise ritual out of my song writing. Every morning I get up at about 5am and light some candles and write music. This inspired my last album \u2018Dawn Sounds\u2019 which came out in January 2023. I toured it around the world as an independent self managed artist.and sold over 12 thousand tickets and played 149 concerts Now I'm back in Australia in my camper van writing this from a small town on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. I\u2019m have a new album coming out October 11th and am. excited tour it all around the world. It\u2019s called \u2018It\u2019s Lovely To Have You Here\u2019"

  "description": "For most current technology, it is assumed that the user is always online and has access to unlimited data. But this assumption is only valid for regions with the infrastructure to support the internet. As more vital communications and services transition into websites, how do we make sure that these services are still usable in areas with only low bandwidth internet or during natural disasters? In this event we will start a discussion about developing smaller websites for accessibility in Aotearoa.\nAbout the host\nVic Roberts is a computer vision scientist who works with machine learning in medical imaging.
