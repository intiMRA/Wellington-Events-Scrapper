  "description": "One of New Zealand's most celebrated live acts, dance music duo SACHI have today announced two shows across P\u014dneke and T\u0101maki Makaurau. August will see SACHI head to P\u014dneke, Wellington\u2019s San Fran on Thursday, August 21, followed by T\u0101maki Makaurau, Auckland\u2019s Studio the Venue on Saturday, August 23. \n\nTickets for SACHI\u2019s shows in Wellington and Auckland will be available to purchase by the General Public on Tuesday, July 15 at 12pm local time.\nMastercard cardholders have special access to presale tickets in New Zealand.

Fans can register for access at livenation.co.nz. \nDominating festivals not only in New Zealand but around the world, their success has even seen the pair become the first New Zealand act to play at Belgium\u2019s Tomorrowland festival \u2014 one of the most prestigious electronic music festivals in the world.\nOne of the duo\u2019s earliest champions was renowned producer Diplo. The duo, consisting of Will Thomas and Nick Chrisp, found him on the streets of Auckland, New Zealand and slipped a USB through the window of his SUV. Their efforts paid off when he soon responded and offered a coveted co-sign by playing early tracks \u201cNo More\u201d and \u201cHold On\u201d on his Diplo & Friends BBC Radio 1 Show. In the aftermath, SACHI exploded as a homegrown phenomenon, achieving two chart-topping platinum-certified singles, \u201cNo More\u201d and \u201cShelter,\u201d as well as an official remix of Lorde\u2019s hit single \u201cGreen Light\u201d alongside Montell2099.\nBetween 2016 and 2021, SACHI rolled out a series of three EPs: Lunch With Bianca, Nights With Ruby, and Breakfast With Ella, amassing more than 50 million streams across the trio of projects. Each of the EPs\u2019 title characters represents a different phase of SACHI\u2019s discography \u2014 from their introduction on Lunch With Bianca, to establishing themselves internationally on Nights With Ruby (created while living in LA pre-pandemic), to the full-circle evolution of their most refined and lustrous body of work to date, Breakfast With Ella. While each project takes listeners on an eclectic journey traversing club-ready BPMs from dazzling four-on-the-floor disco-house rhythms to euphoric powerhouse dance-pop hooks, the thread tying each installment of the celebrated trilogy together is found in SACHI\u2019s intention to create dance music whose emotion is as convincing as its ability to make you move.\n2023 saw SACHI tour their headline show across their home territory to sold-out crowds and introduced \u201cCLUB SACHI\u201d \u2014 a sold-out three-date 360 club experience for fans. Collaborating closely with Human Person, the LA-based creative house behind Swedish House Mafia, SZA, and Billie Eilish\u2019s touring live shows, SACHI\u2019s live show has been elevated to surreal new heights. \u201cEver since we started making music, we wanted to create moments to share with friends,\u201d the boys explain. \u201cWe want to give everyone an uplifting and euphoric experience. Our music paints this picture of different energies coming together as a whole.\u201d\nAfter back-to-back New Zealand festival headline sets this past summer, SACHI are working towards their highly anticipated new music, which promises to return to the heart of their rave-oriented roots while always continuing to keep their audience guessing \u2014 they might even get a sneak peek of this magic during these upcoming tour dates.\nSACHI - WELLINGTON AND AUCKLAND AUGUST 2025 \n Presented by Live Nation and George FM\nSAN FRAN, WELLINGTON                      THURSDAY, AUGUST 21\nSTUDIO THE VENUE, AUCKLAND         SATURDAY, AUGUST 23 \n\nTICKETS ON SALE TUESDAY 15 JULY AT 12PM\n\nMastercard and One NZ Presales: Fri 11 Jul, 12pm > Mon 14 Jul, 12pm local\n Live Nation Presale: Mon 14 Jul, 1pm local > Tue 15 Jul, 11am local\n General Public Onsale: Tue 15 Jul, 12pm local\n\n For complete tour & ticket information, visit: livenation.co.nz\n \n Follow SACHI\n FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | YOUTUBE | TIKTOK | SPOTIFY\n \n "

  "description": "This August 24th join alt-folk songwriter Greta O'Leary & Te Whanganui a Tara artist Goodnight My Darling for one intimate and special show at San Fran, performing new and recently released works in celebration of emergence and O\u2019Learys debut record 'River Dark'.\n\u2018A folk-rooted aesthetic that feels almost gothic\u2019 (RNZ). \nTaking her brand new album on tour for the first time this winter, Greta O'Leary performs 'River Dark' across the motu in celebration of its release. River Dark' is O'Leary's debut. \u2018Tender, steadfast and unraveling\u2019, it shot to #9 on the Aotearoa Official Albums Chart, features the SRN #1 singles 'Baby I'm a Singer' and 'Baptised at the Desktop Computer' and has been featured by RNZ, the SRN and Rolling Stone Magazine. O\u2019Leary will be joined in P\u014dneke by her trio, Amy Borovich (HINA, Anna Coddington) and Nava Tekela-Pule (Erny Belle, LEAO).\n\nT\u0101maki Makaurau singer-songwriter and musician GRETA O'LEARY writes with clarity of vision, making introspective observations that seamlessly interlock with her spare, spacious and enthralling songcraft. Through soaring instrumentation, astute and occasionally absurd lyrics of self-reflection and her poignant voice, her debut is \u2018slightly spooky, wryly funny, and expertly written\u2019 (Tony Stamp).\n\nCelebrated local songwriter GRETA O'LEARY is releasing her highly anticipated debut album RIVER DARK. The obscure, dreamlike record was created alongside producer Jol Mulholland at LAB Studios, with Greta's hypnotic songwriting and unmistakable vocals accentuated through the skillful musicianship of instrumentalists Cass Basil (Tiny Ruins, The Veils), Alastair Deverick (Boycrush), Callum Passells (Hans Pucket) and Anita Clark (Motte). Listeners are invited deeper into Greta\u2019s immersive and enthralling world.\n\n\u201cMy first record, a collection of personal, ridiculous and truth telling songs. It took a long time to get here. I was a child shy and unclear, completely confused, absolutely not onboard with future, with goals or activity. I was in the field below the house, I was at the pond with the dog, I played make believe longer than most. I was taught to be quiet.\u201d\n\n*****************************************\n\nGoodnight My Darling is the vision and project of up and coming Te Whanganui a Tara based singer-songwriter Maxine Macaulay.\nWith elements of shoegaze, folk and dreamy melody, Macaulay says her ever evolving vibe is a poetic expression of her life and the places around her. Her songs take you on a cinematic journey, while her ethereal vocals lull you into a quiet sense of peace and appreciation.\nHer 2022 nine-track self-titled album, is a mix of soul-stirring tunes including ode to love, loss and rebirth \u2018The Carriage\u2019, \u2018Until I Return\u2019 and the story of a relationship\u2019s end in \u2018The Trees Have Eyes\u2019\n\nSince 2022 GMD has released singles \u2018Ruby\u2019 and \u2018The Empress\u2019 speaking to creative repression, Motherhood and female empowerment.\nJoining her for her first show since becoming a Mother are band Mitch Kirk, Kim Andrews, Bella Florence and Shaun Blackwell (Hemi Hemingway & John the Baptist). \nWith plans to further morph and develop her experiential sound, Goodnight My Darling is certainly one to watch.\n\nDoors: 5.30PM\nShow: 6.00PM\nSeated show\n\nRuby Music Video (Goodnight My Darling)  - https://youtu.be/hTrQ57GzfWY?si=ygDovdkrXZQhyAqe\nRiver Dark the album - https://music.drm.co.nz/river-dark\nBaby I\u2019m a Singer Music Video (Greta O\u2019Leary) - https://youtu.be/Wjy8xmq6JKs?si=c5xnXtxQ6-Yfzk5x\n\nGreta O'Leary Tour Dates\n16 August - Auckland Guide Hall - Auckland\n22 August - Secret Show - Whanganui*\n23 August - San Fran - Wellington*\n24 August - Sacred Heart - Greytown*\n30 August - Stewart St - Raglan*\n31 August - Leigh Sawmill - Leigh\n3 September -  Dawn - \u014cakura*\n4 September - Hamilton - Last Place\n* (trio show)\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

Gaining international attention after opening for one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most coveted DJs Fred again.. and remixing his song \u2018places to be\u2019 which now has over 2.6M listens on Spotify alone, MESSIE is quickly becoming one of the most exciting new names to watch in New Zealand.\nAudiences will be able to enjoy MESSIE\u2019s high-energy, electrifying set for literally the entire night - with these two shows running until the early hours of the morning.

MESSIE\u2019s sets are guaranteed to be bootleg heavy with something for everyone as she draws from her own music taste of rap and grime, to early 2000\u2019s singalongs, girl-boss anthems and queer music culture in the form of edits you\u2019d never expect.\nAlongside her headline tour around Aotearoa in mid 2024, MESSIE has now brought her fresh, high-energy club music internationally to Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, R&V, Beyond The Valley, Wildlands, Love Saves The Day, Gemfest & Outro Festival.

  "description": "Folk Bitch Trio Debut headline show in Te Whanganui-a-Tara/Wellington\nMelbourne\u2019s alluring Folk Bitch Trio have announced their debut album release tour of New Zealand, playing headline shows in Auckland, Wellington & Christchurch.\n\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories. Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d  As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.  \n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology.\n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

  "description": "After initially calling it a day in 1999, the Jesus Lizard officially return full time to save us from the current state of musical mediocrity with their latest album, Rack. A blistering resurgence of the so-called \u2018noise rock\u2019 they helped define alongside contemporaries Big Black, Flipper, The Birthday Party, with their previous and most noted albums Head, Goat and Liar. For those of us who live in fear of the reunion album and subsequent tour, the Jesus Lizard thankfully display not only the same chaotic and dark nihilism of their earlier careers but also the maturity and seasoning of a band riding a wave of renewed and reinvigorated form. \n\nOnce slated by famed engineer Steve Albini as \u201cthe greatest band I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019 the Jesus Lizard not only lived up to this lofty praise in their prime but continue to do so in their advancing years. David Yow still leads the charge as the maniacally possessed frontman entering crowds with reckless abandon and a stamina that much younger vocalists would kill for. The original rhythm section of David Wm Sims and Mac McNeilly further continue to prove why they were and are the best bass & drum combo since Jones and Bonham, anchoring the ship as Captain Yow and first mate Denison navigate the wild seas of their songs. And while he may not always feature (as he rightly should) on many modern music journalists \u2018best guitarists lists\u2019, Duane Denison could perhaps be the most innovative and idiosyncratic punk rock guitarist EVER. However, each member is a sum of their parts but combined they are as Albini also once said \u201cthe purest melding of the sublime and profane.\u201d\n\nWhether you are a longtime disciple of the Jesus Lizard, seeing them when last here in \u201898, or perhaps your fandom is more recent and have only seen videos of their legendary live performances, you will know that these shows are not to be missed.  \n\nSaturday 11th October 2025 - The Tuning Fork, Auckland (All ages)\nSunday 12th October 2025 - San Fran, Wellington (R18 unless accompanied by your legal guardian)\n\nBio\n\nIn the jade-cultivating climes of online rock journalism, the angle of \u201cband has new album,\u201d  is about as interesting as watching Instagram reels of your brother-in-law\u2019s recent  bathroom remodel. But when a band decides to follow up their last album from over 26 years ago? That\u2019s high on testicular fortitude and as dumb as fidget spinners. Yet, when  that band is the Jesus Lizard, everything in your pathetic cultural dystopia suddenly falls  away and the air smells like Heaven\u2026 Their seventh studio album, Rack, produced by \nPaul Allen, and slated for release on September 13 via Ipecac Recordings, features 11  tracks of brisk guitar rock you haven\u2019t heard since\u2026 the last time the Jesus Lizard took  over a stage in your town. The Jesus Lizard \u2014 vocalist David Yow, guitarist Duane \nDenison, bassist David Wm. Sims, and drummer Mac McNeilly \u2014 have returned with a  record teeming with the kind of madness needed to beat down today\u2019s AOR mediocrity and piss-perfect pop drivel alike. \n\nSince their inception in Chicago in 1987, the Jesus Lizard has thrilled audiences all over  the planet. The impeccable rocket-thrust rhythm section of Sims and McNeilly was the  perfect launchpad for Denison\u2019s jagged yet clean-toned riffing and Yow\u2019s mercurial \nvocalizations manifesting as everything from panicked citizen, reality escapee or  wounded sea mammal. The Jesus Lizard\u2019s fury carried on through six studio albums,  two live recordings and a brace of singles and EPs. \n\nOn Rack, the Jesus Lizard have returned reconstituted, refreshed and positively  revving. No tepid, bland tracks to show how they\u2019ve \u201cmatured\u201d as songwriters. No inane  detours into unnecessary genre exercises. And definitely no weird moves into \nexperimental realms that come off just as contrived and calculated as the top of the  Billboard Charts. The opening salvo \u201cHide & Seek\u201d finds Yow singing/sprechstimming  his way with remarkable clarity as his bandmates shore him up with their patented \nacceleration. The noir vibes coming off of \u201cWhat If?\u201d is a startling direction for the band,  with Yow narrating the action, like he was looking at a random person in an airport  lounge and concocting an elaborate backstory about them. The sinister \u201cAlexis Feels \nSick\u201d is inspired by Girls Against Boys/Soulside drummer Alexis Fleisig\u2019s guarded  opinion of modern life that turns into a treatise of man\u2019s inhumanity to man. \u201cMoto(R)\u201d is  playing out of the coolest car tailgating in the parking lot at one of those horrific radio\nrock fests. And while we\u2019re on the subject of forcing cool into uncool, \u201cFalling Down\u201d  reminds all of us in slightly under three-and-a-half minutes how marvelously badassed  the Jesus Lizard have always been, making our fists ball-up so tightly they look like the ends of chicken bones. \n\nThe Jesus Lizard. They might not be young, but they will never, ever get fucking old.\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

  "description": "T\u0100MAKI MAKAURAU AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND (Jul 9, 2025) \u2013 Manchester based musician Freak Slug - the project of Xenya Genovese - will be welcoming audiences in P\u014dneke Wellington and T\u0101maki Makaurau Auckland into her dreamy indie-pop world this October. Freak Slug performs at San Fran on October 20th and The Tuning Fork on October 21st with her Big Candles tour. \n\nTickets will be available to purchase by the General Public on Friday 11 July at 10:00am local time.\n\nMy Live Nation members will also be able to secure tickets during the presale which commences Thursday 10th July from 10:00am local time. Fans can register for access at livenation.co.nz. \n\nThe name \u2018Freak Slug\u2019 encapsulates Xenya\u2019s artistic world perversely and perfectly. Known for following the beat of her own drum, Xenya\u2019s releases under the name Freak Slug so far include debut 2020 EP Videos and its viral hit Radio (23 million streams and counting), and follow-up EPs I\u2019m In Love (2022) and Viva La Vulva (2023). Having shown listeners her more \u201csummery, happy sound\u201d, she then delivered a more grungy-feel with debut album I Blow Out Big Candles, furthermore pushing the diversity of her sound. \n\nHugely influenced by \u201890s cult heroes including Ride, Mazzy Star and Stephen Malkmus, Freak Slug is all about hitting a mood. Everything that fuels her creative output is raw, authentic, sometimes weird, but always totally true self-expression. I Blow Out Big Candles is a strong statement of all of this and more. Down there, picking through the curious mix of sounds and feelings, from nostalgic, \u201890s-influenced and dreamy as well as eccentric and experimental, lives Freak Slug. The 10-track project gives listeners a taste of what they will be in for at her Aotearoa shows, a journey of both soft soulfulness and sonic songwriting, all laid out on the table. \n\nI Blow Out Big Candles is as fearless a record as Xenya herself and was met with features and reviews throughout some of the most prestigious radio and media platforms in the United Kingdom. With her 4 piece band, Freak Slug has performed at SXSW Austin \u2013 and was the most searched UK artist at the 2025 edition - alongside many other showcases and festivals. Earlier this year Freak Slug completed her Big Candles tour of the US, CA, UK and EU taking in 40 cities including sold out dates in LA, Chicago, Seattle, London, Paris and Amsterdam, she also has a busy summer of festivals festival with a headline slot on the alcove stage at Latitude."
