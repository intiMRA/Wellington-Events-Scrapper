  "description": "Folk Bitch Trio Debut headline show in Te Whanganui-a-Tara/Wellington Melbourne\u2019s alluring Folk Bitch Trio have announced their debut album release tour of New Zealand, playing headline shows in Auckland, Wellington & Christchurch.\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d  As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions.\nSinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky."
