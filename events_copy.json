It then, finally, progresses to the world of \u2018living fossils\u2019 such as ginkgo and the even more primitive horsetails.\nA public talk associated with the display will be held at the Tree House on 2 December.\n\nTreehouse Visitor Centre\n1 Nov 2025 to 31 January 2026\nMonday - Friday 9am - 4pm\nWeekends & Public holidays 10am - 4pm\nClosed Christmas Day\nFree",

Now venue name, in co-operation with Te Papa, is set to reveal some of the fascinating science and wonderful secrets of one of New Zealand\u2019s most significant natural history specimens.\n\nTe Papa's Head of Natural History, Phil Edgar, said, \u201cIn learning about this weird and mysterious creature, we hope visitors will have a greater appreciation for life in the deep sea, much of which remains undiscovered.\u201d\n\nThe Colossal Squid is one of the most iconic specimens at Te Papa, and while touring the complete specimen is impossible, some of the important parts of the squid have found their way to Cobblestones.\nTe Papa\u2019s Curator of Invertebrates, Dr Rodrigo Salvador, explains how important the Colossal Squid has been for the science community, and how popular it has been among the public.\n\n\u201cTe Papa\u2019s Colossal Squid has been a major source of information for scientists and the museum\u2019s most popular exhibit since its debut. They live in the deep Antarctic waters, and despite being one of the largest invertebrate species in existence, they are very rarely captured\u201d.\n\nColossal Squid Ngu Tipua centres around an interactive table displaying many different objects, including the lens from an eye of the Colossal Squid, part of a tentacle, and a complete tiny squid, a miniature of its colossal relative. Touchable rotating models of a squid\u2019s tentacle hook and the Colossal Squid's beak are also on display.\n\nThe exhibition also displays two documentaries which show life in the depths of the Southern Ocean, and how the most complete Colossal Squid ever found ended up at Te Papa.\n\nThe public can continue the experience and learn beyond the exhibition with a new Te Papa press book for children, Whiti: Colossal Squid of the Deep, and online Te Papa resources, including a free downloadable Colossal Squid Activity Book.\n\n\u201cThanks to the support of WBS and Te Papa, Cobblestones is delighted to be bringing this fascinating exhibition to Wairarapa during the summer holidays. It\u2019s a must-see exhibition for the young and young at heart to learn about this fascinating creature, its world, and habitat.\u201d\n\nColossal Squid Ngu Tipua is developed and toured by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\nCobblestones Museum - 063049687 or cobblestonesmuseumgreytown@gmail.com",

But instead of craning your neck to look up, A Different View invites you to experience Michelangelo\u2019s genius from an entirely new perspective \u2013 from above and up close.\n\nThis immersive experience, completed with guided audio, allows visitors to admire every intricate detail of Michelangelo\u2019s work, many from just two metres away \u2013 offering a far more intimate and comfortable viewing experience than the Vatican itself, where some 20,000 people queue daily for a glimpse.\n\nWith no time constraints, visitors can allow these masterpieces to truly soak in.\n\nAs an addition to \u2013 and to complete \u2013 Michelangelo \u2014 A Different View, reproductions of 14 of these impressive frescoes await visitors inside the exhibition. Scenes from the lives of Jesus and Moses, painted by Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli, provide additional historical background and allow for a deeper insight into this epoch.\n\nEnhancing the exhibition further, VIP guided tours will be led by Dr Christopher Longhurst, a theologian and aesthete who served for 17 years as an operatore didattico at the Sistine Chapel, St Peter\u2019s Basilica, and the Vatican Museums' Papal Art Galleries.\n\n* Booking and credit card fees apply",

    "long_description": "Start the new year with intention in a fun and inclusive environment. The beginning of the year is a perfect time to get together and feel the power of community and connection through singing.\nSing for renewal and hope. Sing for harmony, joy, and inspiration. Sing for healing. Sing to regain your strength and empower others.\nSpend the 2 days encircled by a community of like-minded people and focusing on your well-being through singing. Rest, connect, and restore. The weekend is carefully planned so there is plenty of time to sing and to rest in between.\nWe will breathe together, listen, create beautiful sounds, let go of our worries, and lift each other to a sense of fulfillment and joy. And to make the event even more special, Lala will be cooking an authentic Malagasy dinner on Saturday night (an experience not to be missed).\nJonathan Berkahn and Lala Simpson have been working together, leading workshops and performing for many years. They are both highly skilled song leaders who lead from the heart and joyfully share their gifts. You will be in safe hands. ALL SINGERS OF ALL LEVELS OF ABILITY ARE WELCOME!!!\nJonathan will teach a mix of pop, folk and original songs, and Lala will teach a mix of songs from South Africa, Georgia, Madagascar and community songs.\nIf you are coming from out of town, the Home of Compassion offers some accommodation with reasonable rates which includes breakfast. Please contact them directly to enquire islandbay@compassion.org.nz\nSCHEDULE\nSaturday, 17th of January: This first part of the retreat will be at the Island Bay Presbyterian Church. We will spend the day singing in the beautiful auditorium and share a Malagasy meal cooked by Lala at the end of the day. Morning tea, afternoon tea, and dinner provided. Please BYO lunch.\nSunday 18th of January: We will be singing in the Lyon Room at the Home of Compassion in Island Bay. We will finish the day singing the songs we learn through the weekend at a FREE community concert in the Chapel. Morning tea, afternoon tea, and lunch provided.\nThe Iskand Bay Presbyterian Church and the Home of Compassion are within walking distance of each other.\nBring a water bottle, swimming togs if you want to swim in Island Bay during lunch time, and a picnic mat for eating outside.",

Its return 34 years later at the 2026 festival is highly anticipated. It has become a landmark piece of New Zealand theatre \u2014 exploring the tension between past and future. Set in the summer of 1965, the play follows Hone, who brings his family from New Zealand\u2019s East Cape to the South Island in search of a better life. As they gather for a beachside birthday h\u0101ng\u012b with their P\u0101keh\u0101 guests, buried secrets and cultural tensions rise to the surface. Far from their  t\u012bpuna , the family must navigate questions of identity, belonging, and survival. \nWaiora Te \u016akaip\u014d was conceived, written and directed by Hone Kouka (Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101ti Raukawa, Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu). The multi-award-winning writer/director has penned 13 plays. Many have been staged in Aotearoa and further afield in Canada, South Africa, New Caledonia, and the UK. Waiora Te \u016akaip\u014d is presented in partnership with the Aotearoa New Zealand Festival of the Arts, Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, Auckland Theatre Company and Tawata Productions.",

    "long_description": "It\u2019s Westerberg High, where popularity is a matter of life and death. Welcome to \u2018Heathers the Musical\u201d. Based on a movie with the same name, the show is a coming-of-age story dealing with love, heartache, defying expectations, and being true to yourself. It originally premiered in Los Angeles in 2013. Since then, the musical has had record-breaking seasons across the globe. It now makes its professional New Zealand debut in 2026, and Wellington is in line to join the school assembly. Described as a high-octane, black comedy rock musical, Heathers is packed with a mix of ballads and showstoppers. The catchy tunes are written by Kevin Murphy (Desperate Housewives) and Laurence O\u2019Keefe (Legally Blonde: The Musical). \nThe 1989 film starred Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. It quickly achieved cult status among audiences. Both the movie and musical follow high school student Veronica Sawyer. Veronica is just another nobody until she\u2019s unexpectedly taken under the wings of the beautiful and cruel Heathers. When mysterious teen rebel J.D. arrives, Veronica learns that it might kill to be a nobody, but it's murder being a somebody. \nThis special production will feature a stellar Australasian cast. So grab your scrunchies, break out the Corn Nuts and wait for the bell to ring.",

As such, the club is once again organizing Centurion on Wellington Anniversary.\nWhat is \"Centurion\"?\nIt's a social event where teams known as \"Car-horts\" complete over 100 holes across the Greater Wellington region trying to collect as many birdies as possible. \"Car-horts\" consist of 2-4 players (or as many as you can fit in your car). Bragging rights are awarded for best individual birdie performance, best total Car-Hort birdie performance, and overall score.\n*Can anyone beat Johnny Wake's 58 birdie/2 ace performance?\n**Yes, aces/eagles count as 2 birdies!\n***Who will hit double digits underpar?\nWhere is it?\nThis year, the 108 Holes will be played at Harcourt Park, Hikoikoi Reserve, Poole Crescent Reserve (Wainuiomata), and the Berhampore Hills.\n- Holes 1 to 36 are at Harcourt Park (2x Short/\"Main Tees\")\n- Holes 37 to 54 at Poole Crescent Reserve (2x \"Main Tees\")\n- Holes 55 to 72 are at Hikoikoi Reserve (2x \"Main Tees\")\n- Holes 73 to 108 are at Berhampore Hills (2x \"Black Tees\")\nCar-Horts may complete the event in any sequence they wish, but must score the round on UDisc using the hole allocations above.\nAll disc golfers are welcome to compete, so if you're interested/plan on competing, please post in the event discussion who's in your Car-Hort, as well as your Car-Hort name.\nDon't have a Car-hort? No worries! Make a post about seeking a Car-Hort, or reach out to Brady Kuech who is organizing the event.\nFor those posting on social media (Instagram, Facebook, and Stories), tag @greaterwellingtondiscgolf and #gwcenturion to be featured on our socials. We'd love to share all the action throughout the day.\nSo charge your phone. Pack a lunch. Slather on your suncream, and nab them birdies! ",

The Police, Hollywood, And Other Adventures\u2019 show to our shores, following dozens of sold out shows across the UK.\n\nStewart says, \u201cDemand for this intimate new show has surpassed my expectations, and I can\u2019t wait to return to Australia & New Zealand next year and share the stories of my life with even more fans.\u201d\n\nAs one of the greatest rock drummers of all time, he drove the all-conquering success of The Police during the 1970s and 1980s, before being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A multi-Grammy winner, who followed his work with The Police by composing music for soundtracks for Hollywood movies and operas, Stewart is hitting the road for his most intimate tour to date.\n\nHaving played drums for Curved Air from 1975 to 1976, Stewart was the founding member of The Police, recruiting lead singer Sting and guitarist Andy Summers.\nHis remarkable talent helped drive The Police to world domination between 1977 and 1986, and then again from 2007 to 2008 when the band reunited.\n\nHis Hollywood soundtracks include Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Rumblefish and Oliver Stone\u2019s Wall Street and Talk Radio. He has written books, formed supergroups, made films, and composed music for ballet, opera, and classical concerts.\n\nThis special evening with Stewart Copeland will provide a fascinating insight into his incredible life as a performer, musician, entertainer, and writer. All shows will be hosted by acclaimed Perth radio broadcaster, Sarah Tout.\n\nMeet and Greet packages will be available and fans will also be able to submit questions for Stewart to answer on stage.",

She has toured widely across the Nordic region and beyond with her distinctive solo vocal concerts. Drawing on singing traditions from her two home countries, Finland and Sweden, she blends bright Scandinavian clarity with darker East European colours, performing in churches, museums, festivals, clubs and concert halls.\n\nHer concerts celebrate the power of the human voice: a one woman band creating sound worlds you may have never heard before. Tradition meets vocal art, experimentation and storytelling in a personal and intimate way. Audiences everywhere connect to the honesty of an unaccompanied voice, no matter the language.\n\nAlongside her solo work, F\u00e4lt collaborates in performing arts and multidisciplinary projects, and is an active teacher and lecturer. She holds three music degrees and has studied folk music in five countries, but her central focus remains developing the art of solo a cappella performance. She has collaborated with several Aotearoa artists over the years, including film composer Karl S\u00f6lve Steven and taonga puoro player Rob Thorne.\n\nF\u00e4lt now returns to Aotearoa for her third tour, bringing her powerful voice and Nordic stories back to local audiences.\n\nKoha entry.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Acclaimed Irish band Beoga will make their long-awaited return to New Zealand in January 2026, performing two intimate headline shows in Auckland and Wellington.\nKnown for their adventurous spirit and willingness to chart new musical territory, Beoga have redefined the possibilities of Irish traditional music. Their global reach was cemented through collaborations with Ed Sheeran on the record-breaking \u00f7 (Divide) album, including the smash hits \u201cGalway Girl\u201d and \u201cNancy Mulligan.\u201d The former has now surpassed 1.4 billion streams on Spotify alone.\nAfter a four-year hiatus from touring and releasing music, Beoga made a powerful comeback earlier this year with their new album Phases, released in June. The band went on to perform at Glastonbury and Coachella, where they shared the stage with Shaboozey, Alex Warren, and Ed Sheeran at his now-famous Old Phone Pub pop-up experience.\nWith a GRAMMY nomination, international tours, and collaborations with some of the biggest names in music, Beoga have established themselves as one of Ireland\u2019s most exciting and genre-blurring acts. Their sound fuses accordion, fiddle, keyboards, guitars, and vocals into a vibrant, modern take on Irish roots music that feels both timeless and new. ",

These workshops are suitable for both beginners and more experienced watercolour artists who would like to fine tune their skills and style.\n\nEach class is two hours and the cost of $50 includes all materials and a glass or two of wine. Just turn up empty handed and leave two hours later with your completed watercolour painting to be proud of and a beaming smile of creative satisfaction on your dial.\n\nIf at some stage you might be looking for a unique event for a birthday party or for a work social group evening, ask about our special group rates. Please also check out the school holiday art classes for youth.\n\nCheck out other school holiday art classes for youth, each has a different subject to choose from.",

Her music offers futuristic, playful rave vibes, featured on labels like Planet Euphorique and Dekmantel, alongside her own imprint, Step Ball Chain, and since bringing her sound to Berlin she has cemented her status in the global underground scene.\nWith these two iconic figures in command of the tools, you can expect nothing but pure quality throughout, as we prepare to undergo a true sonic journey across flavours of acid, house, techno, jungle and whatever else the selectors decide to pull out of the bag. \nTo begin the journey, we have local hero CURRENT BIAS, peddling their distinctive brand of atmospheric and deconstructed club music.

    "long_description": "Wilson Blackley returns to Aotearoa alongside Oscar LaDell and King Leo this summer to celebrate the release of his new song 'Remain' (Co-written by Troy Kingi).\n\nWilson Blackley is an Australian multi-instrumentalist and producer currently based in Melbourne. Born and raised in Poowong (Victoria), Wilson was surrounded by music from an early age. At just 2 years old he started playing the drums along to his mother\u2019s music collection consisting of old soul, funk and r&b from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. He started learning the guitar as soon as he could, and had the habit of making anything he could get his hands on into an instrument. Growing up far from the city instilled a strong sense of curiosity and work ethic in him from a young age, leading him to produce his first batch of demos in his teenage years. A stand-out among these demos was the song \u2018Home\u2019. \u2018Home\u2019 found its way to Sam Teskey (The Teskey Brothers) who would go on to co-produce the song alongside Wilson when he was just 18.\n\nFollowing the release of \u2018Home\u2019, he went on to sell out The Gasometer and play a string of festival slots alongside a variety of artists including The Teskey Brothers and Boy and Bear. At this time, Wilson moved to St Kilda and in the heart of Melbourne began collaborating with Sensible J (Sampa The Great, Remi, Immy Owusu) on his debut EP \u2018Material Plane P1\u2019 which was released to critical acclaim in August 2022. After that, he co-produced Oscar LaDell\u2019s EP \u2018No Blue\u2019 and subsequently embarked on a co-headline tour of Aotearoa and Australia with LaDell. After a three year break from releasing music, Wilson Blackley returns to Aotearoa alongside Oscar LaDell and King Leo this summer to celebrate the release of his new song 'Remain'",

Our students plan parts of their day, select work that meets their interests and pace, and deepen concentration in long, uninterrupted work sessions.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Our curriculum is grounded in \u201cEducation for Life\u201d \u2013 we integrate academic learning with care for each child, community, culture and the environment.

    "long_description": "What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

    "long_description": "Neurodiversity seems to be a hot topic of discussion lately. Famous singers such as Lewis Capaldi and Sia and actors such as Ryan Gosling and Channing Tatum have discussed their neurodiverse conditions. Lockdowns and social media have driven many adults to have startling realisations about their own neurodiverse conditions. It seems suddenly \u2013 all at once \u2013 the world has become aware that 15-20% of people have different types of brains. (Free for NZ citizens/residents, all others pay $99).\n\nDescription\nThis one-day workshop introduces you to the topic of neurodiversity and considers some of the key conditions that people live with. We look at:\n\n-ADHD \u2013 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n-Autism\n-The \u201cDys family\u201d \u2013 dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia (Developmental Coordination Disorder)\n-OCD \u2013 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\n-Tourette\u2019s Syndrome\n\nTikTok creator and public speaker on neurodiversity, Nigel Sutton, will introduce the subject and help you discover the definitions and impacts of each of the key kinds of neurodiversity. Working together with other participants, you will consider many key commonalities that those living with various neurodivergent conditions experience. We will expose the realities of being neurodivergent in a \u201cneurotypical world\u201d, and this will allow you to develop empathy and practical strategies to support neurodivergent people to be their best.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s leading dyslexia expert, Mike Styles, will provide an interactive and participatory session to assist you in understanding and supporting a family member or friend who has dyslexia or a similar learning difference.\n\nYou will be able to ask anything you want with our neurodivergent hot seat session.\n\nFind out from those offering \u201clived experience\u201d what it is really like to have a different kind of brain. This one-day workshop is: \u201dNeurodiversity in a Nutshell\u201d \u2013 whether you know a little or a lot, whether you are a relative, employer, partner, friend, or just interested to know more about neurodiversity \u2013 this workshop is for you!\n\n[You must be a NZ citizen or resident to register in this course for free, and you must provide photo ID when you attend. If you are unable to attend the course, we cannot guarantee that you will be able to enrol again for free for a funded course in the future.\n\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead, so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

This event will be hosted at the legendary venue, Valhalla on the 24th of January, 8pm onwards.\n\nKozy will be playing a 2.5 Hour Extended Set, Aztoria will be playing a 1.5hr set & local legends will be playing an hour each.\n\nInternational DJ Bio's:\n\nKOZY ( CA)\n\nKOZY aka Jeff Koz is a Montreal-based DJ & Entrepreneur specialising in dark & groovy underground techno music.\nKOZY's dedication to music is evident in his tight mixes, solid track selection and inclination towards groovy synths and heavy, disruptive bass.\n\nIn 2019, he founded AlpaKa MuziK, a Montreal-based record label pushing world-class underground progressive, minimal and psychedelic techno beats. With releases from some of the biggest names in the game, AlpaKa MuziK has been paving the way for this fast emerging genre with relentless quality music and has become one of the most prominent labels in the psychedelic techno sub-genre.\n\nWith over 125 releases and over 650 tracks under their belt, AlpaKa has quickly become a powerhouse label in the underground techno community.\n\nSince early 2022, in a little over 2 years, KOZY has gone on 9 international tours, including 5 euro tours, Australia, South Africa Mauritius, India, Mexico and has played over 150 gigs in 24 months in over 30 countries and counting.\n\nSome prominent festivals he has performed at include, Esoteric in Australia, Hadra in France, Texas Eclipse, Boom Festival and many others, bringing to many of them the AlpaKa MuziK takeovers that showcase the cutting edge psychedelic techno sound through countless live sets around the world.\n\nHe recently finished his 4-month long 2025 summer euro tour where he performed at Boom Festival in Portugal and many more AlpaKa Showcases all around Europe and beyond. His 2025-2026 world tour is in motion, with Japan and a large Southern Hemisphere schedule in the works. With an unstoppable arsenal of unreleased, cutting edge bangers, he'll leave you wanting more after every set.\n\nAZTORIA ( AU)\n\nAztoria is the psytech project of Ashley Zadel, also known as Flow Theory.\n\nFor more than 16 years, his melodic bush techno sound has evolved through auditory storytelling on stages across the globe, from Cape Town to London, Israel to Brazil, Portugal, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nRooted in progressive soundscapes with an organic flavour, Aztoria blends melodic deep house grooves with minimal techno to craft psychedelic atmospheres that ignite the imagination.\n\nAztoria burst onto the scene with his debut EP Reborn (Dense Nebula Records), hitting #4 on Beatport\u2019s Techno charts. His 2024 single Birds of Paradise (Soliq Records) soared to #33, while his Inner Groove remix landed at #23 in Progressive House (Techgnosis Records). With fresh releases on Techgnosis, Recovery Collective and Puzzles Records and more in the works, Aztoria is carving his path in the underground with relentless energy and innovation.\n\nWhether in the depths of a forest or the heart of a concrete jungle, Aztoria\u2019s tunes will captivate and elevate you with his storytelling magic.\n\n\nMusic Links:\n\nKOZY:\n\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/kozy_alpaka\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/KozyAlpaKa\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kozy_alpaka/\n\nAlpaKa MuziK:\nLinktree: http://alpakamuzik.com/\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/alpakamuzik\nBeatport: https://www.beatport.com/label/alpaka-muzik/80811\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6EsSTQhe0uLiZuACEccK9w?si=2e2088e283414cc0\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXZKtpUzqv6-R1AKYIexDAA\nBandcamp: https://alpakamuzik.bandcamp.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlpaKaMuziK\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alpaka_muzik/\n\n\nAZTORIA MUSIC\n\n\nAztoria Latest Music Releases:\n\nBIRDS OF PARADISE - REMIXED EP - AZTORIA\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/birdsofparadiseremixed\n\nMYSTIC JESTER - AZTORIA & NOSTAVALGIA\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/mysticjester\n\nSANDS OF TIME - AZTORIA REMIX\nhttps://go.protonradio.com/r/rlIZKx5uDuHaQ\n\nTHE INNER GROOVE - AZTORIA REMIX\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/theinnergroove\n\nBIRDS OF PARADISE - SINGLE - AZTORIA\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/birdsofparadise\n\nREBORN EP - AZTORIA & T-REX\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/reborn\n\n\nAztoria Latest Sets:\n\nAztoria @ Dimension Festival 2025\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aztoria/aztoria-dimension-festival-2025\n\nAztoria @ Spring Campout 2024\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aztoria/spring-campout-2024\n\nAztoria @ Rabbits Eat Lettuce 2024\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/rabbitseatlettuce2024\n\nAztoria @ Bello Bush Tech\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aztoria/bello-bush-tech\n\nBush Tech Vibes\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aztoria/bush-tech-vibes\n\nR18| ROAR",

    "long_description": "Wilson Blackley The Remain Tour with Oscar LaDell\nWilson Blackley The Remain Tour with Oscar LaDell.\n\nWilson Blackley is an Australian multi-instrumentalist and producer currently based in Melbourne.\n\nBorn and raised in Poowong (Victoria), Wilson was surrounded by music from an early age. At just 2 years old he started playing the drums along to his mother\u2019s music collection consisting of old soul, funk and r&b from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. He started learning the guitar as soon as he could, and had the habit of making anything he could get his hands on into an instrument. Growing up far from the city instilled a strong sense of curiosity and work ethic in him from a young age, leading him to produce his first batch of demos in his teenage years. A stand-out among these demos was the song \u2018Home\u2019\n\n\u2018Home\u2019 found its way to Sam Teskey (The Teskey Brothers) who would go on to co-produce the song alongside Wilson when he was just 18.\n\nFollowing the release of \u2018Home\u2019, he went on to sell out The Gasometer and play a string of festival slots alongside a variety of artists including The Teskey Brothers and Boy and Bear.\n\nAt this time, Wilson moved to St Kilda and in the heart of Melbourne began collaborating with Sensible J (Sampa The Great, Remi, Immy Owusu) on his debut EP \u2018Material Plane P1\u2019 which was released to critical acclaim in August 2022. After that, he co-produced Oscar LaDell\u2019s EP \u2018No Blue\u2019 and subsequently embarked on a co-headline tour of Aotearoa and Australia with LaDell. After a three year break from releasing music, Wilson Blackley will return with his new song \u2018Wired\u2019 that bridges the sonics from his first EP with what's to come.\n\nAlso appearing Oscar LaDell hot off a US tour.\n\nDoors open 8pm for an 8.30pm start.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Wilson Blackley The Remain Tour with Oscar LaDell.\nWilson Blackley is an Australian multi-instrumentalist and producer currently based in Melbourne.\nBorn and raised in Poowong (Victoria), Wilson was surrounded by music from an early age. At just 2 years old he started playing the drums along to his mother\u2019s music collection consisting of old soul, funk and r&b from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. He started learning the guitar as soon as he could, and had the habit of making anything he could get his hands on into an instrument. Growing up far from the city instilled a strong sense of curiosity and work ethic in him from a young age, leading him to produce his first batch of demos in his teenage years. A stand-out among these demos was the song \u2018Home\u2019\n\u2018Home\u2019 found its way to Sam Teskey (The Teskey Brothers) who would go on to co-produce the song alongside Wilson when he was just 18.\nFollowing the release of \u2018Home\u2019, he went on to sell out The Gasometer and play a string of festival slots alongside a variety of artists including The Teskey Brothers and Boy and Bear.\nAt this time, Wilson moved to St Kilda and in the heart of Melbourne began collaborating with Sensible J (Sampa The Great, Remi, Immy Owusu) on his debut EP \u2018Material Plane P1\u2019 which was released to critical acclaim in August 2022. After that, he co-produced Oscar LaDell\u2019s EP \u2018No Blue\u2019 and subsequently embarked on a co-headline tour of Aotearoa and Australia with LaDell. After a three year break from releasing music, Wilson Blackley will return with his new song \u2018Wired\u2019 that bridges the sonics from his first EP with what's to come.\nAlso appearing Oscar LaDell hot off a US tour.\nDoors open 8pm for an 8.30pm start.",

    "long_description": "Yippee! The time has finally come to celebrate the release of the Bri Louise Album.\nRogue & Vagabond on 24th of January.\n\nElly Mae and her band will be opening up before the Bri Louise Band takes the stage. The night will also feature some very special friends of ours, including Keira Batten-Copgan, Felix Hilton, Leji, Gala Baumfield, Meihana McGee, the Bri Louise Choir, and the Bri Louise Jazz Orchestra.\n\nHeres a few words about the two bands if you arnt acquainted with them:\n\nBri Louise blends sultry queerness with smooth love and undeniable groove. Rooted in gospel and neo-soul, their sound expands into a rich fusion of jazz, hip-hop, and R&B. Poetic lyricism is supported by a tight live band that features colourful keys, phatty bass, flashy beats, vibrant guitar, and fruity woodwinds. We will be joined by many guests but our core features Bri Louise (vocals/keys), Molly Wyatt (flute/vocals), Becky Devine (bass), Theo Thompson (guitar), Eloise Edmonds (saxophone), and Jonathan Stolk (drums).\n\nElly Mae crafts songs that encapsulate the bittersweet ache of growth, the quiet unraveling of time, and the soft glow of nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, indie, shoegaze, and anything in between. From lullabies that make you feel weightless to being wrapped in a blanket of sound, Elly Mae\u2019s folk/country melodic guitar style is accompanied by experimental, spatial bass from Arran Cargill-Brown and textured pocket drumming from Sasha Francis-Murray.\n\nCome celebrate this very special night and the release of this cool project with us.\nTickets available via UTR. Poster artwork by Keelin Bell.",

Each month's workout will have a specific focus, with an emphasis on reps over theory. Our \"Undisputed Champions\" sessions are aimed at highly skilled improvisers with strong performance experience.\n\nIf you're not sure which workout is best for you, take our wee quiz linked below or get in touch. We're happy to offer some guidance.\nhttps://opinionstage.com/page/d55e4c73-8faf-4d9c-9910-320b2dd00d6e\n\nOPEN SESSION DATES:\nSunday 25 Jan\nSunday 22 Feb\nSunday 22 March\nSunday 26 April\nSunday 24 May\nSunday 28 June\nSunday 26 July\nSunday 23 August\nNote: No September session due to NZIF\nSunday 25 October\nSunday 22 November\n\nSEASON PASS:\nBook a season pass to get access to all 10 Undisputed Champion sessions for the whole year at a reduced rate. Please note these are paid out straight away so refunds are not available for season passes. We'll reduce the pricing of these as the year goes on, so feel free to try out a session with a standard pass first.\n\nSTAND-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2026. We'll giveaway any spots remaining on the Friday before each Workout, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email and we'll pop you on the SBL. Everyone on the list will be notified whether there was a place available for them 2 days before the relevant workshop.\n\n",

This is a special time in the History of Creation that so many seekers have been born on this Earth. They have realized that there is something beyond than the mundane life they have to seek. This is not the seeking of one life. It is the seeking of ages which is being prophesied, has to be fulfilled now. There have been prophesies and prophesies about this great time. In India about 14,000 years back, Brigu Muni has written a book called Nadi Grant in which He has described you all saying that a day that will come when all these greater seekers, great seekers will be born on this Earth and that their Kundalini which is the Power of their True Desire will be awakened spontaneously and they\u2019ll find out what they are.\n\nBut also there has been prophesies about many fake people coming on this Earth and they will try to delude and take people away from the truth.\n\nThere have been also great prophesies all over the world but especially in England about hundred years back a great poet called William Blake was born and He has written so clearly, so clearly about Sahaja Yoga that it is surprising how He has even exactly mentioned the house where I\u2019ll be staying. Also that he has said that the men of God, meaning the seekers, the men of God will become prophets and they will have the power to make others prophets. This is the sign we should take when we are seeking the truth.\n- Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi (Founder - Sahaja Yoga Meditation)\nBring in your friends and families too to this course :)\n#meditation #21 Day meditation # Sahaja Yoga #meditate #guided_meditation #classess #online #online_event #online_classes #online_meditation #yoga #online_meditation_class #meditation_class #meditation_course #peace #yoga_day#online_meditation_course #sahaja_yoga #spirituality #Yoga #kundalini #chakra #nadi #nirvicharita #workshop #seminar #spiritual_awakening#self_development #self_improvement #google #eventbrite #kundalini_activation #healing #kundalini_yoga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:45 PM - 03:00 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f Introduction & Recap\nInfo: If you missed the initial session, you are provided a one-on-one session in a breakout room to get you up to speed\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:00 PM - 03:30 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f Guided Meditation\nInfo: \u2744\ufe0f\u26c5Water, light, fire, sky, ground and other elements will be used to enhance the power of meditation and internal cleansing\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:30 PM - 03:45 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f One-to-one session (Optional)\nInfo: On-demand revision, healing, spiritual talks, technique practice, and more...\n\n\n\n",

This is a special time in the History of Creation that so many seekers have been born on this Earth. They have realized that there is something beyond than the mundane life they have to seek. This is not the seeking of one life. It is the seeking of ages which is being prophesied, has to be fulfilled now. There have been prophesies and prophesies about this great time. In India about 14,000 years back, Brigu Muni has written a book called Nadi Grant in which He has described you all saying that a day that will come when all these greater seekers, great seekers will be born on this Earth and that their Kundalini which is the Power of their True Desire will be awakened spontaneously and they\u2019ll find out what they are.\n\nBut also there has been prophesies about many fake people coming on this Earth and they will try to delude and take people away from the truth.\n\nThere have been also great prophesies all over the world but especially in England about hundred years back a great poet called William Blake was born and He has written so clearly, so clearly about Sahaja Yoga that it is surprising how He has even exactly mentioned the house where I\u2019ll be staying. Also that he has said that the men of God, meaning the seekers, the men of God will become prophets and they will have the power to make others prophets. This is the sign we should take when we are seeking the truth.\n- Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi (Founder - Sahaja Yoga Meditation)\nBring in your friends and families too to this course :)\n#meditation #21 Day meditation # Sahaja Yoga #meditate #guided_meditation #classess #online #online_event #online_classes #online_meditation #yoga #online_meditation_class #meditation_class #meditation_course #peace #yoga_day#online_meditation_course #sahaja_yoga #spirituality #Yoga #kundalini #chakra #nadi #nirvicharita #workshop #seminar #spiritual_awakening#self_development #self_improvement #google #eventbrite #kundalini_activation #healing #kundalini_yoga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:45 PM - 03:00 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f Introduction & Recap\nInfo: If you missed the initial session, you are provided a one-on-one session in a breakout room to get you up to speed\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:00 PM - 03:30 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f Guided Meditation\nInfo: \u2744\ufe0f\u26c5Water, light, fire, sky, ground and other elements will be used to enhance the power of meditation and internal cleansing\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:30 PM - 03:45 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f One-to-one session (Optional)\nInfo: On-demand revision, healing, spiritual talks, technique practice, and more...\n\n\n\n",

The damp, cobbled pavement glistens as the lights of street lanterns dance across the slick stones. The night chills the bones and shivers the soul of anyone outside.\n\nYet inside these tavern walls the food is hearty, and the ale is warm and frothy. A fire blazes in the hearth, and the tavern is alive with the voices and laughter.\n\nSuddenly, the tavern door swings open, and you all notice it at the same time. Framed by the lamp-lit fog, a form strides through the doorway. His brightly coloured clothes are draped in loose folds about him, and his hat hangs askew, hiding his eyes in shadows. Without hesitation, he walks up to your table and pulls from his tunic a sealed letter, addressed to all of you in beautiful flowing script. He drops the letter on the table and turns and leaves the tavern, vanishing into the fog.\n\n\u2018Curse of Strahd\u2019 is a D&D5E gothic horror campaign. It has everything you and your party needs to have a grand experience. It will take you to the mysterious village of Barovia, a realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by a wizard, the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, the master of Castle Ravenloft. \u2018Curse of Strahd\u2019 is a rich narrative story you are part of as it\u2019s unfolding. It\u2019s not just about fighting monsters and hunting for treasure in dungeons; there is a compelling story arc and a richly realized antagonist.\n\n",

Andy will guide you through both the practical techniques (composition, light, lines, verticals, details, context, people, dusk shooting, interiors, and more) and the deeper creative side of architectural photography: developing your own way of seeing, storytelling through space, emotion, rhythm, and the relationship between buildings, people, and place.

The day is followed by an online Zoom session where Andy will set a project and provide image feedback and Photoshop advice\u2014helping you move beyond technical competence toward more meaningful, confident architectural images.

    "long_description": "Twentysix Gallery is pleased to present our first exhibition of 2026, \u2018As the moon holds the sun's gaze\u2019, a group show featuring new works by Belinda Whitta, Kaia Waite, Kieran Trainor and Sage Rossie-Tong. Their practices form a web of relationality that traces light and shadow, ancestry, identity and ecological rhythms \u2013 reflecting what is revealed, what remains hidden, and how we care for both.\nBelinda\u2019s work draws from ancestral sites as spaces of knowledge that is felt, inherited, and gently carried. Through analogue photographic processes, her practice attends to what resists visibility. Darkness, or the unknown, is not absence, but a vessel \u2013 an elder space where memory, ritual and abundance gathers. This reverence flows into Kaia\u2019s practice, where laser-etched wood is engraved, filled and sanded back to a place of cyclical return. Working with personal taonga, Kaia\u2019s practice is grounded in whakapapa and p\u016br\u0101kau, carefully negotiating what is shared and what is protected.\nKieran\u2019s practice moves fluidly across disciplines, following a path of light that stretches across bodies, land, and time. Painting becomes an embodied act of sensing how light transforms all it touches \u2013 offering warmth and connection while marking thresholds of care. Sage\u2019s intricate chainmail web draws all of these threads together. Both home and battleground, the web becomes a site of creation, nourishment and death. Rooted in queer methodologies, Sage\u2019s practice asks us to sit with our own entanglements and how we inhabit, intervene, and remain accountable to the ecosystems we are part of.\n\u2018As the moon holds the sun's gaze\u2019 expands outward \u2013 river and well, light and dark, past and present \u2013 allowing multiple truths to coexist. Meaning is not carried by a single narrative, but by the strength of the web itself. Through this collaboration, an exhibition has emerged that is slow and porous \u2013 reflecting on what it means to collectively tend, witness, and hold what is visible and what remains in shadow.\nJoin us for the opening celebration on Thursday, 29 January at 5.30pm \u2013 all artists will be present.\nThe exhibition runs from 30 January \u2013 21 February 2026 at Twentysix Gallery.\n",
    "description": "Twentysix Gallery is pleased to present our first exhibition of 2026, \u2018As the moon holds the sun's gaze\u2019, a group show featuring new works by Belinda Whitta, Kaia Waite, Kieran Trainor and Sage Rossie-Tong.\nTheir practices form a web of relationality that traces light and shadow, ancestry, identity and ecological rhythms \u2013 reflecting what is revealed, what remains hidden, and how we care for both.\nMeaning is not carried by a single narrative, but by the strength of the web itself.\nThrough this collaboration, an exhibition has emerged that is slow and porous \u2013 reflecting on what it means to collectively tend, witness, and hold what is visible and what remains in shadow.\nThe exhibition runs from 30 January \u2013 21 February 2026 at Twentysix Gallery.",

Sharing a meal is a simple way to extend the sense of community and connection. This gathering is offered on a non-profit basis.\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. Over the years, Andre has come to value the power of sitting in circle\u2014of men coming together in honesty, vulnerability, and presence to witness and support one another. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n................................................................................................\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

An evening of layered vocals, familiar melodies and unique songwriting supported by Madeleine Dove.\nBorn and raised in T\u0101huna Queenstown, Violet's musical journey began the day she was born: opening night of her mother's musical Kitchens. Her songs and live performance embody the theatrics and ballads that surrounded her childhood. Gaining comparisons to Aldous Harding and Julia Jacklin, Hirst\u2019s songs combine hypnotic vocal melodies with meditative rhythms and poignant lyrics from a young woman. After touring the USA as a support musician for Flying Nun rockers Office Dog, Hirst is back on the road to share her own new works.\nHer debut album Donegal was recorded in Central Otago with De Stevens (Roundhead Studios, Marlin's Dreaming) and Reuben Scott (Saltwater Criminals, Molly Payton). The album received a Student Radio nomination for Best Album, charting on both SRN and Radioscope charts. Followed with a nationwide tour and sold-out shows, Hirst is excited to return to the road for the first time since then. Joined by Madeleine Dove (vocals, keys) the duo will perform new contemporary meditations and vocal experiments.\n\u201c(Donegal) is brimming with the confidence of an artist fully inhabiting their own sound; wistful and slightly heartbroken, but unencumbered by expectation.\" - RNZ\n\u201cEvident to everyone present was how special that rainy night was, how flawless, nuanced and emotive Hirst\u2019s singing and songwriting. The real deal, with the crowd standing in the rain outside afterwards, not ready to leave, raving.\u201d - NZ Musician\nhttps://violethirst.bandcamp.com/\n",

With the old ones still unresolved.\n\nHow is it possible to find peace and stability in a world such as ours? Is it possible?\n\nAlbert Einstein said: ' A problem can never get resolved on the same level it originated.'\n\nTo find stability, there's need to rise to a higher platform.\n\n\nMeet your host, Nava\n\nNava\u2019s natural interest in studying physics blossomed into metaphysics when she arrived in the land of the long white cloud. Originally from Germany, Nava was travelling on a quest to find purpose and answers to the mysteries of life. Did she find anything on this quest? Yes! After four exciting years of inquiry, practice, and being immersed in the wonders of bhakti yoga, she is still fully inspired by what she has discovered. Mesmerized by the depth and broad-mindedness that a yoga lifestyle offers, Nava is keen to share with you that wisdom and love, along with her experiences on the road of life. Nava is also an expert vegan chef who specializes in European cuisine and baking, and she is busy spreading that kind of love around Bhakti Lounge too!\n\n6.15pm Tuesday 27th January\n\nEnd the session on a high note with a delicious plant-based dinner, dessert, and good conversation.",

Borell\u2019s curatorial vision is clear \u2013 M\u0101ori art must be authored, not simply advocated for. For the artists, this represents a chance to be seen on their own terms and is an initiative that ultimately leads some to the global stage of the Venice Biennale. \nBut as the scale of the exhibition grows, so does the institutional resistance. The result is a reckoning: whose story is being told, and who holds the pen? With many of the artworks exploring the legacy of colonialism, the making of the exhibition itself becomes a living reflection of that very struggle. Laying bare behind-the-scenes conversations rarely seen on screen, TOIT\u016a Visual Sovereignty lifts the curtain on the inner workings of an institution and examines the cost of visibility without control \u2013 and the quiet power of walking away. \u2014 Heperi Mita \nThe screening will be followed by a Q and A with Director Chelsea Winstanley.",

We offer this course to women to learn to deal with women-related challenges, encouraging every woman to overcome anxiety or fear, with confidence, skills, strength.\nIn an ideal world, women would not need to learn to protect themselves. However, until some deeply ingrained societal problems are resolved, it is smart and necessary to have some skills to be able to look after yourself and loved ones with. In the meantime, we encourage every women to approach this training with personal development, personal growth, enjoyment and empowerment being the motivating purpose.\nWe understand women often prefer to train in a women's class. This is our Women's (13+) class called ROAR.\nBeginning in 2018, this program was created to provide a safe, holistic and supportive class where women can experience empowerment through training. You will learn to find your voice, inner strength and resolve, while learning physical skills such as how to escape and overpower an assailant, counter grabs, abduction attempts, chokes, hair grabs, pushing and shoving, being hit, being pinned to the ground and sexual assault attempts. We will help you unleash your protective feminine fighting spirit.\nThe Intro Night is the ideal time for women interested in the Women's Class to try a class first, see how we train, who we are, and gain some valuable basic skills, before deciding to join the full course. (Note: School Term 1, 2025 is 10 weeks long). No cost to attend the Intro Night.\nPlease email contact@tacticalsurvival.co.nz to enquire or book your spot.\nMore Info: www.tacticalsurvival.co.nz/womens\nAfter Intro, classes run every Wednesday night 7:00pm - 8:00pm (Thistle Hall Cuba St) ",

Weaving together synthesisers and swirling guitar strums with rock and jazz inspired drum beats, BADTAB creates a unique and refreshing sound. The band made their mark in 2024 with a prolific run of releases. September saw the drop of The P\u014dneke Sessions, collaborative EP with Cellz. Then came December\u2019s Echo Chambers Of\u2026, their full-length debut album that introduced the world to BADTAB\u2019s expansive soundscape. Since the release of their debut album, they have been deep in the works on their sophomore album which is anticipated for a 2026 summer release.\n\nBri Louise blends sultry queer with smooth love and undeniable groove. Their sound has roots in Gospel and Neo-Soul, evolving into a rich fusion of Jazz, Hip-Hop, and R&B. Bri\u2019s music features a talented live band that supports their poetic lyrics with colourful keys, phatty bass, flashy beats, vibrant guitar and fruity woodwinds.\n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue. Minors are of course not allowed to purchase alcohol under any circumstance.",

    "long_description": "Twentysix Gallery is pleased to present our first exhibition of 2026, \u2018As the moon holds the sun's gaze\u2019, a group show featuring new works by Belinda Whitta, Kaia Waite, Kieran Trainor and Sage Rossie-Tong. Their practices form a web of relationality that traces light and shadow, ancestry, identity and ecological rhythms \u2013 reflecting what is revealed, what remains hidden, and how we care for both.\nBelinda\u2019s work draws from ancestral sites as spaces of knowledge that is felt, inherited, and gently carried. Through analogue photographic processes, her practice attends to what resists visibility. Darkness, or the unknown, is not absence, but a vessel \u2013 an elder space where memory, ritual and abundance gathers. This reverence flows into Kaia\u2019s practice, where laser-etched wood is engraved, filled and sanded back to a place of cyclical return. Working with personal taonga, Kaia\u2019s practice is grounded in whakapapa and p\u016br\u0101kau, carefully negotiating what is shared and what is protected.\nKieran\u2019s practice moves fluidly across disciplines, following a path of light that stretches across bodies, land, and time. Painting becomes an embodied act of sensing how light transforms all it touches \u2013 offering warmth and connection while marking thresholds of care. Sage\u2019s intricate chainmail web draws all of these threads together. Both home and battleground, the web becomes a site of creation, nourishment and death. Rooted in queer methodologies, Sage\u2019s practice asks us to sit with our own entanglements and how we inhabit, intervene, and remain accountable to the ecosystems we are part of.\n\u2018As the moon holds the sun's gaze\u2019 expands outward \u2013 river and well, light and dark, past and present \u2013 allowing multiple truths to coexist. Meaning is not carried by a single narrative, but by the strength of the web itself. Through this collaboration, an exhibition has emerged that is slow and porous \u2013 reflecting on what it means to collectively tend, witness, and hold what is visible and what remains in shadow.\nJoin us for the opening celebration on Thursday, 29 January at 5.30pm \u2013 all artists will be present.\nThe exhibition runs from 30 January \u2013 21 February 2026 at Twentysix Gallery.\nOpening Hours:\nThursday 12pm - 6pm\nFriday 12pm - 6pm\nSaturday 10am - 4pm\nOr by appointment ",
    "description": "Twentysix Gallery is pleased to present our first exhibition of 2026, \u2018As the moon holds the sun's gaze\u2019, a group show featuring new works by Belinda Whitta, Kaia Waite, Kieran Trainor and Sage Rossie-Tong.\nTheir practices form a web of relationality that traces light and shadow, ancestry, identity and ecological rhythms \u2013 reflecting what is revealed, what remains hidden, and how we care for both.\nBelinda\u2019s work draws from ancestral sites as spaces of knowledge that is felt, inherited, and gently carried.\nMeaning is not carried by a single narrative, but by the strength of the web itself.\nThrough this collaboration, an exhibition has emerged that is slow and porous \u2013 reflecting on what it means to collectively tend, witness, and hold what is visible and what remains in shadow.",

The duo is celebrated for their crystal clear sound, marked by a signature blend that captures the essence of late 90's jungle, dub, and ambient sounds, designed to evoke a rich, textured soundscape. They have released on some of the finest labels in the game, including White Peach, Deep Dark and Dangerous, Chord Marauders and Artikal Music, as well as their own imprints, The Chikara Project and Moth Club. Ghost Media hosted them last time they came here back in 2024, and we can\u2019t wait to welcome them back.\nJoining them we have BOASTEEZE from Christchurch, a multitalented selector with a penchant for serious wubs. Boasteeze\u2019s sound is deep and heavy, spanning the full spectrum of the 140 continuum. Ally is one of our favourite DJs in the country, and we\u2019ve been looking for an opportunity to get this legend to the capital, so now seems like the perfect chance!\nOn closing duties we have CONNA, a skilful DJ and producer from Wellington, showcasing a range of his original dubstep and jungle productions, alongside some of his favourite tunes. Opening up proceedings, we have none other than the FURTHER SOUND crew delivering a workout with some of their favourite dub records, because what\u2019s the point in owning a giant set of speakers if you don\u2019t get to play on it sometimes?\nLast but not least we\u2019ve got Young Gho$t on hosting duties, because he just loves playing with the Mystic State boys. They locked in together at Matakanarama and it was something seriously special, so Ghosty is gonna dust off the old mic and try to recapture some of that magic or better yet - make some new magic!\nAs per, it\u2019s a Banshee Soundsystem install, and you know exactly what that\u2019s gonna sound like.\nLimited early birds are available for a cheap as chips $20. Secure yours now and prepare for an evening of serious bass and vibes.",

Let's create a 2026 that is amazing.\n\nEach new year we are encouraged to think about new year\u2019s resolutions. As we know these often don\u2019t play out, we are unable to follow through or we lose momentum or we just make them unachievable.\n\nThe purpose of this workshop is to explore what you might want to create, change, or stabilise during 2026 through the exploration and the identification of a word that brings the energy you want for the year.\n\nI have been working with this concept of a word for a number of years now and always when I reflect at the closing of the year, I can identify how this has played out during the year. It works! Reset was my word for 2025!!!\n\nOn the day we will have a gentle yoga practice (all levels), meditation and journalling prompted by a framework (you\u2019ll find out on the day) that encourages us to open up to the possibilities of 2026 and to set a clear intention of what we want from the year and how one word can energise that intention.\n\nI will provide some materials for you to create a vision board if that is your intention to do so. I will also provide material (or a framework in corporate speak) to support you in your reflections on what it is that you want in 2026.\n\nInvestment is $60. If you want to explore Nga Manu as well, I would definitely encourage that, we can provide you with a discounted access ticket of $15.\n\n",

Gamma brainwaves are associated with states of deep meditation, heightened awareness, and higher brain functions.\n\nBreathwork and other deeply meditative practices activate gamma waves and there is a correlation between gamma waves and DMT release, with one seeming to stimulate the other.\n\nBreathwork experiences and benefits so often parallel those of DMT and other psychedelic plant-medicines, DMT is produced naturally in the brain, and is released during Breathwork.\n\n\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude46 \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4e:\n\n\u2022 Anxiety, depression and stress\n\n\u2022 Increase energy & boost immunity\n\n\u2022 Improves sleep\n\n\u2022 Lowers blood pressure & improves circulation\n\n\u2022 Improves mood & self esteem & helps manage depression\n\n\u2022 Relese toxins\n\n\u2022 Helps manage pain & restrictions in the body\n\n\u2022 Releasing trauma & emotion & manage PTSD\n\n\u2022 Gaining body awareness\n\n\u2022 Connecting to intuition and receiving guidance\n\n\u2022 Past life clearing and understanding\n\n\u2022 Spiritual awakening and expansion\n\n\u2022 Karmic release and ancestral work\n\n\u2022 Increasing creativity and self-expression\n\n\u2022 Life purpose clarity\n\nA breathwork journey is unique to each person and and the results are profound.\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a \ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4f:\n\n\u2022 Doors will open at 3:00pm and you will have a few moments to get grounded and set up for your \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b experience.\n\n\u2022 We will open up with an introduction to this \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b technique and prepare to start the Breathwork Medicine Journey.\n\n\u2022 You will then be guided through a 90 minute experience recieving healing & expansion bridging the gap between your human self & higher self.\n\n\u2022 Your only job is to be open minded, relax, and let your breath guide you on this medicine journey be open to receive any healing or guidance that comes up throughout the journey.\n\n\u2022 We will close of with an intergration circle finishing up at 5:30PM and have an hour break, to ground, nourish our bodies, and have a swim before we prepare for the Sound Bath at 6:30PM.\n\n\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude68:\n\nBreathwork results in certain specific physiological changes in the body and also can result in intense physical and emotional release.\n\nAs a precaution, the following conditions are contraindicated in certain breathwork practices.\n\nIt is crucial that you inform your breathwork practitioner if any of the following conditions are relevant to you:\n\n\u2022 Pregnancy (at any stage)\n\n\u2022 Severe PTSD or trauma\n\n\u2022 Currently using recreational drugs\n\n\u2022 Recent surgery\n\n\u2022 Taking any medication that alters brain chemistry like anti-anxiety,anti-depressant, ADD, OCD medications, etc.\n\n\u2022Detached Retina\n\n\u2022Glaucoma\n\n\u2022Kidney disease\n\n\u2022High Blood Pressure\n\n\u2022Cardiovascular disease, including angina, previous heart attack or stroke\n\u2022Diagnosis of aneurysm in the brain or abdomen\n\n\u2022Uncontrolled thyroid conditions\n\n\u2022Diabetes\n\n\u2022Severe Asthma\u2014 for mild to moderate asthma, we can discuss but you must bring your inhaler to the session.\n\n\u2022 Epilepsy\n\n\u2022 History of Seizures\n\n\u2022 Prior diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or previous psychiatric condition.\n\n\u2022Any other medical, psychiatric or physical conditions which would impair or affect the ability to engage in any activities that involve deep physical and/or emotional release.\n\n\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4c\u2019\ud835\ude68:\n\nWhat can I expect?\n\nThere will be a short guided meditation, explanation of conscious connected breathwork (how to do it, tetany, things that may happen etc), a full 60 min breathwork journey and space afterwards for a few to share about their experience and any questions asked and support given if needed.\n\nI have one or more of the listed contraindications -

    "long_description": "Fairy Tours\nBeyond the vials, the Unseen kingdom waits for the day they can meet you again.\n\nI have seen and connected with these races all of my life. There are many, many races that live beyond the veil of our perception. The Green kingdom beings of the Fae and the Elves, the beings of the twigs and leaves. There are the earth-dwelling races of the dwarves and elementals. The \u201cUnseen Kingdom\u201d banner includes the mer people, dragons and the unicorns. In fact, they gave me the term \u201cthe Unseen Kingdom\u201d to describe all of the hundreds of races and beings that humans seem incapable of perceiving.\nIn this experience, we will meet on the margins of the forest. You are invited to bring whatever you need to be comfortable sitting or lying down.

Visceral and cathartic shows where crushing riffs & sprawling drones collide with extended bursts of wild improvisation. In 2024, the band released their critically acclaimed album The Healer, a sweeping, transformative work spanning four monumental tracks. The record dives deep into themes of regeneration, suffering, and spiritual reconstruction \u2014 a testament to the band\u2019s ability to meld raw power with emotional depth.\n\nThe experimental metal trio\u2019s four-song, 76-minute album is the peak of their career. It\u2019s dense and invigorating, highlighting the band\u2019s dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. - Pitchfork\n\nSoon after the release SUMAC teamed up with poet and sound artist Moor Mother to release The Film, a boundary-pushing collaborative album. Released via Thrill Jockey in April 2025, the record unfolds as a cinematic journey across eight \u201cscenes,\u201d merging SUMAC\u2019s heavy, jazz-inflected textures with Moor Mother\u2019s incisive spoken-word commentary.\n\nSUMAC\u2019s work has always been about transition between different states of being. Our sense of normal, and indeed our sense of life, is now being shaken. We don\u2019t know what is coming next. We are looking for pointers towards the future, as well as things to hold onto in the moment.\nNew Zealanders, don\u2019t miss this rare and powerful journey into uncharted sonic terrain.\n\n",

It\u2019s a space where sapphic, trans, nonbinary, and gender-diverse people aren\u2019t just welcomed \u2013 we are centered. It\u2019s for those who are often pushed to the margins, who rarely feel represented in \u201cinclusive\u201d spaces that still cater to the mainstream.\n\nThis night exists because we need it \u2013 and because we create it, together.\n\nAccessibility\nThis event is located on the ground floor.

It\u2019s dense and invigorating, highlighting the band\u2019s dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. - Pitchfork\nSoon after the release, SUMAC teamed up with poet and sound artist Moor Mother to release The Film, a boundary-pushing collaborative album. Released via Thrill Jockey in April 2025, the record unfolds as a cinematic journey across eight \u201cscenes,\u201d merging SUMAC\u2019s heavy, jazz-inflected textures with Moor Mother\u2019s incisive spoken-word commentary.\n\nSUMAC\u2019s work has always been about the transition between different states of being. Our sense of normal, and indeed our sense of life, is now being shaken. We don\u2019t know what is coming next. We are looking for pointers towards the future, as well as things to hold onto in the moment.\n  \nNew Zealanders, don\u2019t miss this rare and powerful journey into uncharted sonic terrain.",
    "description": "Formed in 2014, the powerhouse trio, comprised of Aaron Turner (guitar, vocals; Isis, Old Man Gloom), Brian Cook (bass; Russian Circles, Botch), and Nick Yacyshyn (drums; Baptists), are renowned for merging crushing heaviness with improvisational freedom, exploring the boundaries between structure and chaos.\nSUMAC have built a reputation as a fearsome live band.\nVisceral and cathartic shows where crushing riffs & sprawling drones collide with extended bursts of wild improvisation.\nThe record dives deep into themes of regeneration, suffering, and spiritual reconstruction \u2014 a testament to the band\u2019s ability to meld raw power with emotional depth.\nThe experimental metal trio\u2019s four-song, 76-minute album is the peak of their career.",

Choose between doing your own thing, or jumping on a serene cruise of the Whanganui River onboard the coal fired paddle steamer \"PS Waimarie\".\n\nLeaving Kapiti as most others are still sound asleep, we quickly escape the coast and delve into the rurality of the Horowhenua. After a stop in Palmerston North we head up the trunk through the townships of Feilding and Marton before turning onto the Marton - New Plymouth railway line for the last stretch into Whanganui. After crossing the 290km long Whanganui River, we proceed slowly down the short 5km branch line taking us to Taupo Quay.\n\nTRAVEL ON THE PADDLE STEAMER WAIMARIE!\nSalvaged from the bottom of the Whanganui River where she sat for around 50 years, the Paddle Steamer Waimarie was restored to her former glory and re-launched in 2000. She is now the only one of her kind in operation in New Zealand. Your cruise leaves the Riverboat Centre Wharf and heads upriver taking in the scenery and views of Whanganui which can only be experienced from Te Awa Tupua, the Whanganui River. The commentary shares riverboat history and points of interest along the way. Check out the boiler that powers our paddle steamer, and maybe meet the homing pigeons and send a message with them on their flight back to the Riverboat Centre.\n\nDeparting Paekakariki/Paraparaumu/Waikanae/Otaki/Levin\nAdult 13+ yrs - $209\nChild 2-12yrs - $179\n\nDeparting Palmerston North/Feilding\nAdult 13+ yrs - $189\nChild 2-12yrs - $169\n\nBuses will transport you from your arrival at the station to the Waimarie River Boat Centre.\n\nDO YOUR OWN THING!\nThere will be a collection of vintage cruiser bikes for hire for a small fee to those keen to take exploring to the next level.\n\nThere will be short tours available at the Durie Hill Elevator. It is New Zealand\u2019s only public transport elevator and is still used on a daily basis by locals and visitors.\n\nThere are multiple places to go, and things to see on a cruiser bike or on foot. Take a tram ride for a small fee and arrive at the Riverboat museum, be blown away by NZ Glassworks, admire the sculptures and views from the Motua gardens along the river, indulge in local cuisine, or simply shop local.\n\nDeparting Paekakariki/Paraparaumu/Waikanae/Otaki/Levin\nAdult 13+ yrs - $159\nChild 2-12yrs - $139\n\nDeparting Palmerston North/Feilding\nAdult 13+ yrs - $139\nChild 2-12yrs - $119\n\nBook at https://steaminc.org.nz/book-train-trip/river-city-express/\n\n",

Italian pianist and composer Ludovico Einaudi is returning to Wellington with a new album to explore with audiences. The Michael Fowler Centre will be filled with Ludovico\u2019s special mix of neo-classical, pop, ambient, rock, and experimental styles. His modern soundscapes are renowned for being able to cross artistic and generational boundaries. Because of this, he has become one of the world\u2019s most-streamed classical music artists. \nLudovico began composing in the 1980s for theatre and ballet. He has since gone on to write for film and television and produce multi-million-selling albums. His most recent is \u2018The Summer Portraits\u2019.

How do we protect and share our heritage?\n\nAbout this Event\n\nPublic artworks are more than simple decoration. They hold stories of place, identity and change. When the spaces around them shift, those stories can be at risk. Who carries responsibility for protecting heritage works, and how do we ensure they remain part of our shared future?\nThe early spark for The Wheel of Avalon began when artist Bronwyn Holloway-Smith was invited to Avalon TV Studios in her role as Co-Director of Public Art Heritage Aotearoa New Zealand. There, viewing Bill McCardle\u2019s mosaic mural, she reflected: \u201cThe story of the mural feels like a metaphor for the rise and fall of Avalon Studios.\u201d\nJoin Holloway-Smith for an engaging and thought-provoking talk exploring this work alongside a Guy Ngan mural in Naenae and a piece by E. Mervyn Taylor in Taita. Together, these three recent projects reveal different approaches to safeguarding the Hutt\u2019s public art heritage and open a conversation about what proactive, future-focused care and preservation of public art could look like in the years ahead.\n\nDr Bronwyn Holloway-Smith (P\u0101keh\u0101) is an award-winning conceptual artist, author, and researcher. Her interdisciplinary practice spans public art, digital media and deep-dive research, often focused on the tangled legacies of cultural memory, P\u0101keh\u0101 identity, and the politics of preservation. She lives on P\u014dneke's rugged south coast with her partner and their three offspring.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Do you long to explore connection beyond the visuals?\nAfter a wonderful series of events in San Francisco, Portland, Amsterdam, Berlin & Edinburgh, Relating in the Dark is returning to Wellington for a special one-off evening this summer! Grab a blindfold and dive deep into the enriching practices of Authentic Relating, Movement Meditation & Conscious Touch.\nBy exploring intimacy without sight, we will delve into our intuitive nature, sharpening our capacity for deeper connection. We will use blindfolds to invite you into profound contact with your physical sensations and internal reality, unblocking your inhibition so as to reveal your truest essence.\nWHO is this event for?\nThis event is for anyone who is seeking deeper connection, stronger community, consensual loving touch, or simply a safe space to just be yourself.\nIf you\u2019re a curious, open, emotional human being and want to enhance your interpersonal relationships and enrich your self love within, this event is for you.\nThis event is also for you if you\u2019ve been recently feeling blocked, anxious, lacking purpose or direction, and need to reground and remind yourself what's truly important and who you truly are.\nMy experience includes working with Highly Sensitive People (HSPs); neurodiverse people; people suffering from anxiety and depression; people going through major life shifts; and members of the LGBTQ+ community.\nIf you have any questions about whether the event would suit you, pop me a message and I\u2019ll get back to you within 24 hours.\nWHAT will we explore?\nActivities will explore movement, contact and relating, with and without vision and words, by exploring the practices of Authentic Relating, Movement Meditation & Conscious Touch.\nAuthentic Relating is is a ground breaking social tool that enables you to playfully & courageously dive into open hearted connection, through radical honesty and active listening. The practice invites you to drop deeper into presence, embodied awareness and permission to express whatever is alive within you and the \u2018we-space\u2019 between you and other(s).\nMovement Meditation is free-form journey of authentic bodily flow. It invites you to surrender to what is arising in your body when deeply in connection with music, inducing a natural state of ecstasy.\nConscious Touch is the practice of bringing full attention and presence into relating physically to another person. In deeper awareness of our desires and boundaries, we will explore the many layers and dimensions of non-sexual touch.\nTogether, we will create a rich container to explore the many layers of our human experience, to invite loving, consensual touch, and arrive more deeply into present moment awareness.\nWHERE will it be?\nThe event will take place in the beautiful urban sanctuary of Wellington Meditation Centre, 31 Hobson Crescent, Thorndon, Wellington 6011.\nThe facilitator\nLaurie (he/him), is a queer British-Kiwi who\u2019s current home-base is Berlin. His passion is creating spaces that cultivate healthy, thriving human-to-human relationships, helping people take off their masks, feel their sensations and celebrate their aliveness on Earth. Since 2019, he has organised and facilitated hundreds of Authentic Relating, Dating and Embodiment workshops in Oceania and Europe.\nHis training includes The Embody Lab, Authentic Revolution, Body Electric, World Peace Yoga School and Connection Institute.\nHe has facilitated at internationally acclaimed festivals such as Stretch and Ignite, and organisations such as ART International and Authentic Bay Area.\nHis workshops have sparked thousands of nourishing connections, turning many strangers into life-long friends. He looks forward to holding space for you!\nFor more information, check out itoiauthenticrelating.com.\nFor his insta, check out: @itoiauthentic.\nHere's what others have said about Laurie's workshops (blindfolded & more) :\n\"This was my absolute favourite authentic relating event. I can't wait for the next one. Removing the clutter and distraction and judgment from my eyes supported me to drop in immediately to my own other senses and hearing and connection with the other. It was incredible.\"\n~ Daniel\n\"What a wonderful event. The blindfolds encouraged me to stay present and in your body. It was a very sweet and safe space to learn and explore. The connections were very fulfilling. A rejuvenating and enjoyable evening indeed!\"\n~ Carrie\n\u201cIt seems funny to say it but I felt so \u2018seen\u2019 without being seen\u201d\n~ Esther\n\u201cI noticed that I was so much more present with myself, and was able to share parts that I would normally find it really hard to share\u201d\n~ Elliot\n\"I love Laurie\u2019s energy, wisdom, execution and light touch. I felt super safe to open up and connect while he was holding the space\"\n~ Tess\n\"I live with complex PTSD and anxiety so in the past I have really struggled to open up to people and build meaningful connections. Discovering these workshops has been a life changer and both my therapist and I are thrilled with how my confidence has blossomed in recent months. Laurie's time and generosity really means the world to me\"\n~ Sarah\nHOW MUCH will I invest?\n$35 - low income\n$45 - medium income\n$55 - high income\nWhy are tickets sold by income?\nIn order to make the event as accessible as possible, there are three ticket types available.

    "long_description": "This class is for level 2+ and advanced students. It is not open to beginners.\n\nStudents must have completed an 8-week block with ring-making and bezel settings or equivalent. If you have not done one of our 8-week beginner\u2019s classes or are unsure of your level because you may have done a few different shorter classes, please contact us, and we can advise you.\n\nThis more advanced class is ideal for those who are already competent at soldering simple joins, annealing and basic tool use on their own.\n\nA more advanced set of students means that your tutor can support you and the group to take on more exciting and complex challenges. They will work with the group to find appropriate projects for you and for the class as a whole. Each 8-week block may focus on a particular skill topic, rather than doing loads of different topics with each student over the block. This means the students will benefit from a more in-depth learning experience, supported practice and peer support from fellow students.\n\nLevel 2 students learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking as a way to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project so they have something to hone their skills that they are familiar with, as well as take on a new skill. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet or a more complex bezel setting.\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple projects they can work on self-directed in class: more chains or simple bezel settings are ideal - to help them strengthen their soldering skills - alongside a challenge project that might be a shelf setting (an adaptation of a bezel setting that can take faceted stones), a tube setting or a larger bezel setting for a box or brooch.\n\nThis class fee does NOT include materials for any student.\n\nAll metals and stones, as well as quality findings and chains, are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it thriftily in future projects!\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time please email us to arrange this ;)",

Students will learn measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting and soldering.\n\nThen we move on to making a practice ring set with a Cabochon stone (a cabochon has a flat bottom and a smooth, domed top) in a Bezel Setting.\n\nAs you work through your practice ring and setting, you can move on to working in silver and produce another ring with a cabochon stone that you really love. This way, you will learn the basics as you go on your practice ring, before taking the next step in costly silver.\n\nThis class has all materials included in the class fee!\n\nEach student receives a carefully curated materials pack including copper or brass, sterling and fine silver for your ring-making projects, as well as two stones from our supply so you get a good stone for your level of experience.\n\nWe have loads of gorgeous stones of a range of colours, and they are all appropriate for beginner settings.\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking.

    "long_description": "Do you keep meaning to read more of the great classics of literature? At Wellington Classic Literature Club, we read novels that have stood the test of time, whether they were written in 1780, 1880 or even 1980. We meet on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nWe return to Russia for our long summer read! The group's first-ever summer book was Anna Karenina, and we read Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov over the 2018/19 summer. (We were also due to discuss his novel Crime and Punishment, but that was set down for April 2020 and, well, the world had other plans\u2026)\n\nThis year, we read another of Fyodor Dostoevsky's masterworks: The Idiot, which was initially published as a serial in 1868-1869. Dostoevsky scholar Joseph Frank said The Idiot \"is the most personal of all his major works, the book in which he embodies his most intimate, cherished, and sacred convictions.\"\n\nThe story revolves around Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin, a young man returning to Russia after spending several years in a Swiss sanatorium for epilepsy. Dostoevsky had set out to create a protagonist with \"a truly beautiful soul\" and to trace the fate of such an individual as he comes into contact with the brutal reality of contemporary society.\n\nRSVP\nIf you use Facebook, you can RSVP to the event on our Facebook page (above) - it really helps us keep track of numbers. Otherwise, just come along...\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place. After you enter the bar, head to your right (up the step) and through a smaller space with booths to the large carpeted space beyond.\n\nABOUT US\nWellington Classic Literature Club has been running for more than a decade - since the start of 2013 - and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers who come along for particular books or simply when it suits. All welcome.",

Driven by groove and the desire to find meaning in the moments on this journey we call life, the musician, songwriter and producer has a signature sound that stands out and stuns. Fowles would describe his music as psychedelic soul laced with blues and funk. It resonates with deep grooves and driving rhythms created by vintage drum sounds, digital sonics, and electric guitars that build and blaze into billowing soundscapes. At its core is his unique, soulful voice and the punchy, heartfelt lyrics he wears on his sleeve.\n\nElly Mae crafts songs that encapsulate the bittersweet ache of growth, the quiet unraveling of time, and the soft glow of nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, indie, shoegaze, and anything in between. From lullabies that make you feel weightless to being wrapped in a blanket of sound, Elly Mae's folk/country melodic guitar style is accompanied by experimental, spatial bass from Arran Cargill-Brown and textured pocket drumming from Sasha Francis-Murray. \n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

    "long_description": "UNLEASH THE VOICES OF YOUR SUN AND MOON\nBook Soon for this special day workshop and explore and unleash the power of your Voice and Astrological Archetypes!!\n\nWe are blessed that Alignment Coach and Healer, Clare Babbage is visiting the Wellington Region from Napier, and collaborating with Voice Empowerment Coach and Healer, Bryony Rogers from Heartsong Healing, in this exciting, unique offering.\n\nThis workshop is a specially designed, transformative full day experience of Embodied Astrological Archetypes and Conscious Sound and Voice Practices.\n\nBOOK HERE - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nOn the date of the full moon, the energies of the sun and the moon stand face to face \u2014 illuminating both our outer expression and our inner world.\n\nIn astrology, the sun represents our fullest expression, our vitality, and the way we are here to shine. The moon reveals our emotional landscape, our inner rhythms, and often the fears that arise when we dare to live that full expression. Together, they form a powerful dialogue between structure and flow, logic and emotion, masculine and feminine.\n\nIn this workshop, Clare will guide you into an embodied exploration of your own sun and moon, inviting you to feel these two archetypes within your body and notice where they support, resist, or balance each other.\n\nBryony will lead you into vocal practices that bring these energies into sound and voice \u2014 giving expression to what is often left unspoken. Through voice, you\u2019ll release what holds you back and discover new harmony between your inner and outer selves.\n\nThis full moon is the perfect moment to unleash the voices of your sun and moon \u2014 and to step more fully into clarity, balance, and authentic expression.\n\nThe timing of this workshop gives you a unique opportunity to tune into these planets and benefit from their placement in the collective astrology.\n\nThe workshop will begin with the opportunity to explore powerful, enjoyable, accessible Voice Practices which open, align and strengthen your expression - and create physiological changes in your energy field.\n\nWe will then directly, bodily experience the energies of each of the Celestial Bodies through Embodied Astrology, guided by Clare.\n\nWe will integrate these energies, through further Voice Practices, including improvisation, healing chants and songs.\n\nThese two modalities will be carefully interwoven in an enjoyable, rich day's workshop that will benefit all participants.\n\nThere will be guided space in the workshop to integrate the energetic shifts and discoveries of both the Voice Practices and the Astrology.\n\nThis special workshop takes place on Saturday February 7th, 10am-4.30pm - we hope you can join us\n\nAt the Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Paraparaumu.\n\nINVESTMENT:\n\nYour investment for this day is $233. Shared lunch.\nSome concessions are available - please contact us by email .\n\nPayment by card here - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nPlease contact us with any questions at all.\n\n",

My Nonno (Leslie George Moleta) spotted my Nonna (Rosina Elvira Barnao) at the Zino-Toscano wedding where she was a bridesmaid. They had two children, both named after their grandparents as was the tradition.

    "long_description": "This is another opportunity to explore charming Greytown houses and gardens where the owners have valued and enhanced the integrity of the building and its environment, and so nurtured Greytown's heritage.\n\nGreytown Heritage Trust offers this self-guided tour, unveiling nine remarkable properties along with three destination events. A newly opened countryside caf\u00e9, spoiling with on-site baking, offers a pause looking out towards the Tararua range. A barbecue in a bucolic Waiohine setting. A f\u00eate, nostalgically redolent of yesteryear, selling perennials, crafts and home produce. There will be Devonshire cream teas and Wairarapa Ros\u00e9 and bubbly, bunting, adventure and indulgence. How could you resist?\nThe houses are further flung than the previous tour and we listened hard to feedback \u2013 fewer destinations but greater distances will mean you\u2019ll more comfortably explore this charming town and it\u2019s houses and gardens.\nYou\u2019re invited to spend a summer\u2019s day exploring remarkable houses and gardens in this attractive town. In so doing you will contribute to a fundraiser for the refurbishment of Greytown's colonial-settler K\u014duka Cottage (c1860) at Stella Bull Park, 113 Main Street, Greytown. This cottage and its maintenance are important in fostering Greytown's architectural heritage.\nReceive with your ticket:\nAccess to 9 of Greytown\u2019s significant private homes & gardens. Access to a f\u00eate, a caf\u00e9 and a countryside barbecue.\nA quality keepsake folding map & information poster. These will be posted to you nearer to the date.\n\nGeneral information & conditions\nProperties are open from 10.00am until 4.30pm. This tour is self-guided; you can visit the properties in any order you wish.\nEach ticket holder will be sent a map and wristbands for entry, by post. It is absolutely critical that you include your address on your Eventfinda registration and purchase of tickets.\nAt each venue you\u2019re asked to present your wristband to the volunteers at the entrance to gain access. Please ensure that you are wearing your wristband during the tour as this will ensure your entry at each address. The wristband isn't transferable to other people during the tour events.\nThe houses, of course, are private homes. Photographs are available on the Greytown Heritage Trust\u2019s media sites and we ask that you don\u2019t take your own photographs inside houses, nor touch furnishings or items. Some areas will be inaccessible and signed accordingly. Some gardens may also be off limits for photography but this will be indicated at the venue.\nKeeping people and property safe is important, this tour is reserved for those aged over 15. We\u2019re also asking that no animals are brought to the visits unless they are mobility-trained and certified. Accessibility is compromised variously in houses and some gardens.\nGreytown public toilets will be marked on the map.\nThe tour will proceed regardless of rain or other moderately poor weather but there may be a cancellation in the event of Met Office amber or red warnings. In this, what we hope is unlikely, event we will communicate with you by email and on social media sites.\nCash sales and some eftpos facilities will be available at some properties. The proceeds or proportions of these sales will also contribute to the fundraiser.\nThe Trust is grateful for your support, and wish you a wonderful day exploring and enjoying Greytown\u2019s heritage properties.\nLinks\nWebsite (for more heritage info):\nhttps://www.greytownheritagetrust.co.nz/\nSocial Media (for sneak peaks of the tour):\nhttps://www.instagram.com/greytownheritagetrust/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/greytownheritagetrust",

    "long_description": "On the 12 February 1909, the SS Penguin sank in Cook Strait in a raging southerly storm with the loss of 72 lives, one of the worst maritime disasters in NZ history.  Many of those who died were woman and children, as their lifeboats capsized in the wild sea. \nAlthough the Captain was heavily criticised, it is still not clear what the ship hit nor where, as the wreck of the Penguin has never been located. \nThe tragedy stunned Wellington and a day of mourning was called for 16 February.  The city came to a standstill as many of those who died were brought up to Karori Cemetery for burial in a long procession of cabs and lorries.\nTo commemorate this tragedy the Friends will be undertaking a guided tour of most of the Penguin graves on Sunday 8th February. \nThe tour duration is approximately 2 hours long.\nThis tour is suitable for people with moderate fitness. The route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. Surefootedness is required.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee). Children under 12 are free.\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nNote:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you one hour before the tour start time by email and on our Facebook page.

He\u2019s toured nearly nonstop across Canada, the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere ever since, living out of backpacks and campervans, averaging over a hundred shows and a dozen summer festivals a year, and distilling his experiences into empathetic, keenly observant verse. Since 2022 he\u2019s been joined full-time by his sweetheart Pamela Mae on upright bass and vocals, crisscrossing 45 US States and 8 Canadian provinces in their campervan Roadetta, and covering a fair bit of Australia in their HiAce Hector. In 2026 they\u2019re bringing the duo project to New Zealand for the first time with an extensive tour of the North and South Islands in support of Cook's eighth album Troubadourly Yours. Fresh from the open road, these are sturdy, straight-talking songs that see the good in you.\n\n\u201cWhip-smart, bone-achingly lovely, socially committed songs presented with a bold, elegant directness evoking the very best of the folk music tradition.

    "long_description": "Christoph Gallio / Phil Durrant\nPhil Durrant (electric mandolin and electronics) and Christoph Gallio (saxophones) are veterans of the international free improvisation scene. Their individual and collaborative projects have helped shape the development of improvised music. They first worked together over 40 years ago, but it wasn\u2019t until 2022 that they started performing as a duo. It is rare that improvisors of their calibre make it out to NZ, so we\u2019re very happy to host them at Pyramid Club for a duo concert plus collaborative sets with local musicians.\n\nPhil Durrant (London, UK) is a multi-instrumentalist improviser, composer and sound artist. As a violinist he was one of the key exponents of the \u2018group voice approach\u2019 style of improvised music, performing as a member of the Butcher/Russell/Durrant trio, News From The Shed and the Chris Burn Ensemble. In the late 90s, his influential trio with Radu Malfatti and Thomas Lehn represented a shift to a more reductionist approach. As a synthesiser player, Durrant performs with Bertrand Denzler and Burkhard Beins in Trio Sowari. He is also a member of the international electronic ensemble MIMEO with Keith Rowe, Kaffe Matthews, Thomas Lehn and Rafael Toral. He has performed all over Europe and Canada and released CDs and records on Acta and Emanem Records.\n\nSwiss saxophonist and composer Christoph Gallio studied classical saxophone with Iwan Roth at the Basel Music Conservator and then with Steve Lacy in Paris. He has collaborated with many of the world\u2019s leading voices in improvisation including Irene Schweizer, Urs Blo\u0308chlinger, Mani Neumeier, Peter Kowald, Fred Frith, Haco, Tetsu Saitoh, Phil Minton, Pablo Diaz, Marcelo von Schultz, Olie Brice, Andrew Lisle, Cath Roberts, Irene Aebi, William Parker, Rashied Ali, Matthew Ostrowski, Gerry Hemingway, Sven-A\u030ake Johansson, Olaf Rupp, Jan Roder, Oli Steidle, Andrea Neumann, Ernst Thoma, Julian Sartorius, Nicolas Stocker, Paula Shocron, Sergio Merce, Alistair Zaldua, Phil Durrant, Roger Turner, Dominic Lash, Mark Sanders and many more. Gallio has been running his own label PERCASO since 1986.\n\nwww.gallio.ch\n\nDurrant and Gallio will perform a duo set, and then be joined by local improvising musicians Tom Callwood (bass), Jake Baxendale (sax) and Daniel Beban (guitar/tapes).\n\nTheir tour is sponsored by Swiss Arts Council, Aargauer Kuratorium, City of Baden, SIS (Schweizerische Interpreten Stiftung) and Fondation SUISA.\n\n\n$20 presale tickets via UTR\n$35 donation tickets\n$15 unwaged door sales\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

Featuring not one, not two, but THREE of P\u014dneke\u2019s premier acts to close our 2026 series out.\n\nDillon Jo is the genre defying project of Wellington Based artists Betty Smith and Georgie Levien. Dillon Jo built paths between the elements of dream pop, shoegaze, folk, alt rock, and indie pop to create their genre defying sound. Having recently recruited Kahu Sanson-Burnett and Ruadh Munro, Dillon Jo has transformed their live sets into an unbridled big-sound shoegaze experience.\nMiles Calder released his solo debut album Autopilot Life in 2021, a self-reflective delve into waking up from an unexamined life, dressed in a psychedelic folk-rock palette that evoked late-era Beatles as much as contemporaries like Kevin Morby and Father John Misty. The album won over new fans and critics alike & led to a nomination for a prestigious Aotearoa Music Award (Te Kaipuoro Taketake Toa | Best Folk Artist 2022). \n\nKeira Batten Coogan writes raw and messy music for alien listeners. Joined onstage by some familiar P\u014dneke talent, his earnest earworms pack more punch than ever. Themes of queerness, growing pains, love, and nostalgia shine through his lyricism and captivates audiences. \n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

The album produced a string of classic singles in \u201cAre You Gonna Be My Girl\u201d, \u201cRollover DJ\u201d, and \u201cLook What You've Done\u201d and netted the band 6 x 2004 ARIA awards.

Reflecting on that era, Nic Cester said, \u201cGet Born was a rare and unique moment of total planetary alignment where we somehow managed to capture lightning in a bottle.\u201d\n\nTheir enduring legacy was officially recognised in November 2023, when they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.\n\nThis February see Jet live \u2013 raw, loud, and full of the spirit that made them international rock legends.",

    "long_description": "Authentic Dating Wellington\n\u201cThank you so much for creating a space in which such well-aligned people could come together. I can't think of the last time I met so many wonderful, open-minded people in one go like that. It was a real pleasure\u201d - John\n\n\nTired of endless scrolling?\n\n\nOver the superficiality of app culture?\n\n\nReady to connect with real people and talk about what truly matters?\n\n\nHere\u2019s your chance take a break from the apps and connect more openly and authentically with those both like-minded and different. After a long break, it's returning to Wellington this February for Valentine's weekend!\n\n\nYou\u2019ll have several encounters throughout the night. Each will be carefully guided, inviting you to be yourself, to communicate openly, and and explore multiples layers and flavours of connection. Come spark a new summer flame! \ud83d\udd25\n\n\nAuthentic Dating welcomes all men, women & non-binary people aged 18+, both monogamous & non-monogamous. We will aim to pair you with a gender different from your own.\n\n\nIs this event for me?\n\nIf you are seeking....\n\n\u2728 Deep & meaningful conversations without small talky chit-chat\n\n\u2728 Exciting new connections, both romantic & platonic\n\n\u2728 An opportunity to explore & challenge your assumptions\n\n\u2728 A substance-free environment\n\n\u2728 Playful & sincere communication activities\n\n\u2728 Skills you can apply to your dating life beyond the event\n\n\u2728 A space to simply be yourself\n\n....then this event is for you!\n\n\nWhat will actually happen? \ud83e\udd70\n\nYou will be invited to explore four unique interactions, some of which are randomised and some of which you can choose. Each will involve a new set of instructions to help you communicate about topics that really matter to you.\n\nEach interaction will last 10-15 minutes. At the end of each interaction, you will have the opportunity to share a contact detail on a piece of paper in a way that is both cute and discrete ~ please bring your own pen!\n\nConsent is important: you always have the agency to choose how deep you go. You will never be forced to share information that you don't want to.\n\n\nWhy are tickets sold by gender? \ud83d\udc6b\n\nTo ensure that the gender balance is as even as possible, it is important to keep track of how many men/women/non-binary people are signing up. If a particular gender is over-represented in the run-up to the event, we do our best to ensure that under-represented gender(s) also sign up.\n\nWhile we aim to achieve an even balance of genders (and ages), this is not always possible. However, what is guaranteed are skills that you can apply to any connection. Simply come with an open mind and ready to connect.\n\n\nThe facilitator \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nLaurie King\n\nI'm Laurie (he/him), a queer British-Kiwi who\u2019s current home-base is Berlin. My passion is creating spaces that cultivate healthy, thriving human-to-human relationships, helping people take off their masks, feel their sensations and celebrate their aliveness on Earth. Since 2019, I have organised and facilitated hundreds of Authentic Relating, Dating and Embodiment workshops in Oceania and Europe.\n\nMy training includes The Embody Lab, Authentic Revolution, Body Electric, Connection Institute and World Peace Yoga School. I have facilitated at internationally acclaimed festivals such as Stretch and Ignite, and organisations such as ART International and Authentic Bay Area.\n\nMy workshops have sparked thousands of nourishing connections, turning many strangers into life-long friends. I look forward to holding space for you!\n\nI also offer online Holistic Coaching sessions, inspired by Authentic Relating, Positive Intelligence and Somatic Experiencing techniques.\n\n\nFor more information, check out itoiauthenticrelating.com.\n\n\nFor my Instagram, check out @itoiauthentic.\n\n\ni to i Authentic Dating has already been a big hit in Wellington, as well as Auckland, Christchurch, Berlin, Amsterdam, Melbourne, Sydney, Vienna, Copenhagen, London, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Montreal.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what others have said:\n\n\n\"This has been the most positive experience I've had in meeting genuine souls with the intention of finding love/romance for over 6 years\" - Luca\n\n\n\"Laurie led us through a series of games and exercises that allowed us to open up and create very real bonds with others and with our own selves. Many emotions were felt in the safest, most welcoming environment\" - Jason\n\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful workshop you ran last night. I walked away with a sense of renewed self worth and also questioned why I don\u2019t articulate comfortably what I want. It\u2019s the perfect antidote to app culture.\u201d - Imogen\n\n\n\u201cLaurie created a beautiful, safe space in no time, making it an ideal environment to be present and engage meaningfully with the activities. Even though all participants were strangers to me, I felt a deep sense of belonging developing over the evening.\u201d - Tim\n\n\n\u201cThank you so much for creating a space in which such well-aligned people could come together. I can't think of the last time I met so many wonderful, open-minded people in one go like that. It was a real pleasure\u201d - John\n\n\n\"I love Laurie\u2019s energy, wisdom, execution and light touch. I felt super safe to open up and connect while he was holding the space\" - Tess\n\n\n\"Authentic Dating re-opened an old window for me in a new way. Heaps of fun too! And I did meet a very special person. Highly recommend for anyone curious and keen to connect with depth & joy\" - Samantha\n\n\nPracticalities:\n\nCost:\n\n$35 for Low income\n\n$45 for Regular income\n\n$55 for High income\n\n*\n\nLocation: Wellington Meditation Centre, 31 Hobson Crescent, Thorndon, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.\n\nWhen: Friday 13th February, 7.30 - 10pm.

This is an excellent opportunity to treat yourself to some creative fun on a Friday night!\n\nIn weeks one and two, you will learn how to work with jeweller's hard wax to create beautiful textures in metal that can be used to create amazing rings or objects. Your waxes will be sent away for casting in the metal of your choice.\n\nThen there will be a week's break before the third session, to allow time for everyone's waxes to be cast. The third session covers how to trim, clean and finish your casts, turning them into original jewellery ready to wear!\n\nMore advanced students can use these sessions to complete projects in a class setting.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are all your different types of waxes, sandpaper and courier costs.\n\nNot included are the casting and metal costs which vary from student to student depending on what sized ring they want to make and the type of metal you choose. Small castings can cost around $6.65 - $12 and might cost between $7 to $30 in metals depending on if you use red bronze, white bronze or silver.\n\nThis class is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.",

    "long_description": "\u201cThank you so much for creating a space in which such well-aligned people could come together. I can't think of the last time I met so many wonderful, open-minded people in one go like that. It was a real pleasure\u201d - John\n\n\nTired of endless scrolling?\n\nOver the superficiality of app culture?\n\nReady to connect with real people and talk about what truly matters?\n\nHere\u2019s your chance take a break from the apps and connect more openly and authentically with those both like-minded and different. After a long break, it's returning to Wellington this February for Valentine's weekend!\n\nYou\u2019ll have several encounters throughout the night. Each will be carefully guided, inviting you to be yourself, to communicate openly, and and explore multiples layers and flavours of connection. Come spark a new summer flame! \ud83d\udd25\n\nAuthentic Dating welcomes all men, women & non-binary people aged 18+, both monogamous & non-monogamous. We will aim to pair you with a gender different from your own.\n\n\nIs this event for me?\n\nIf you are seeking....\n\n\u2728 Deep & meaningful conversations without small talky chit-chat\n\n\u2728 Exciting new connections, both romantic & platonic\n\n\u2728 An opportunity to explore & challenge your assumptions\n\n\u2728 A substance-free environment\n\n\u2728 Playful & sincere communication activities\n\n\u2728 Skills you can apply to your dating life beyond the event\n\n\u2728 A space to simply be yourself\n\n....then this event is for you!\n\n\nWhat will actually happen? \ud83e\udd70\n\nYou will be invited to explore four unique interactions, some of which are randomised and some of which you can choose. Each will involve a new set of instructions to help you communicate about topics that really matter to you.\n\nEach interaction will last 10-15 minutes. At the end of each interaction, you will have the opportunity to share a contact detail on a piece of paper in a way that is both cute and discrete ~ please bring your own pen!\n\nConsent is important: you always have the agency to choose how deep you go. You will never be forced to share information that you don't want to.\n\n\nWhy are tickets sold by gender? \ud83d\udc6b\n\nTo ensure that the gender balance is as even as possible, it is important to keep track of how many men/women/non-binary people are signing up. If a particular gender is over-represented in the run-up to the event, we do our best to ensure that under-represented gender(s) also sign up.\n\nWhile we aim to achieve an even balance of genders (and ages), this is not always possible. However, what is guaranteed are skills that you can apply to any connection. Simply come with an open mind and ready to connect.\n\n\nThe facilitator \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nLaurie King\n\nI'm Laurie (he/him), a queer British-Kiwi who\u2019s current home-base is Berlin. My passion is creating spaces that cultivate healthy, thriving human-to-human relationships, helping people take off their masks, feel their sensations and celebrate their aliveness on Earth. Since 2019, I have organised and facilitated hundreds of Authentic Relating, Dating and Embodiment workshops in Oceania and Europe.\n\nMy training includes The Embody Lab, Authentic Revolution, Body Electric, Connection Institute and World Peace Yoga School. I have facilitated at internationally acclaimed festivals such as Stretch and Ignite, and organisations such as ART International and Authentic Bay Area.\n\nMy workshops have sparked thousands of nourishing connections, turning many strangers into life-long friends. I look forward to holding space for you!\n\nI also offer online Holistic Coaching sessions, inspired by Authentic Relating, Positive Intelligence and Somatic Experiencing techniques.\n\nFor more information, check out itoiauthenticrelating.com.\n\nFor my Instagram, check out @itoiauthentic.\n\ni to i Authentic Dating has already been a big hit in Wellington, as well as Auckland, Christchurch, Berlin, Amsterdam, Melbourne, Sydney, Vienna, Copenhagen, London, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Montreal.\n\nHere\u2019s what others have said:\n\n\"This has been the most positive experience I've had in meeting genuine souls with the intention of finding love/romance for over 6 years\" - Luca\n\n\"Laurie led us through a series of games and exercises that allowed us to open up and create very real bonds with others and with our own selves. Many emotions were felt in the safest, most welcoming environment\" - Jason\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful workshop you ran last night. I walked away with a sense of renewed self worth and also questioned why I don\u2019t articulate comfortably what I want. It\u2019s the perfect antidote to app culture.\u201d - Imogen\n\n\u201cLaurie created a beautiful, safe space in no time, making it an ideal environment to be present and engage meaningfully with the activities. Even though all participants were strangers to me, I felt a deep sense of belonging developing over the evening.\u201d - Tim\n\n\u201cThank you so much for creating a space in which such well-aligned people could come together. I can't think of the last time I met so many wonderful, open-minded people in one go like that.

From white-knuckled driving lessons to petty habits that spark full-blown meltdowns, nothing is sacred. Refusing to drive a manual? Refusing to wipe the bench properly?

Mo and Q are living proof that marriage is messy, weird, and completely worth mocking on stage.\n\nPerfect for date night, mate night, or when you just need to laugh at someone else's dysfunction for once -- Driving Me Crazy is a comedic car crash you'll be glad you didn't miss this Valentine's weekend!\n\nMo Munn is a multi-award-winning comedian, recently named Best Newcomer at the 2025 NZ International Comedy Festival.

This summer, a new company of players, The Midsummer Botanicals, invite audiences to step beneath the trees and into the wild, wondrous world of As You Like It - a sun-soaked celebration of laughter and community blooming in one of Wellington\u2019s gorgeous parks for the first week of the Wellington Fringe Festival.\n\nIn 1983, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream lit up the Victoria University Quad and sparked a beloved tradition of outdoor Shakespeare in Wellington - a festival of artistry, friendship, and open-air delight that ran for over forty years. After its sudden end in 2023, a vital chapter of our city\u2019s cultural story seemed to close. But this February, the Botanicals are bringing it gloriously back to life.\n\nHelmed by director Eli Hancock (he/they) and produced by Shakespeare\u2019s North Productions, As You Like It promises a riotous return to form; where the music is live, the language sparkles, and the forest is very much alive.\n\n\u201cAs You Like It is Shakespeare at his most joyous,\u201d says Hancock. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding yourself in unexpected places - through love, disguise, friendship, and the wilderness. After years of loss and uncertainty in the arts, this feels like a healing; a reminder of why we make theatre in the first place.\u201d\n\nSet in a vibrant reimagining of Shakespeare\u2019s Forest of Arden, this production draws on courtyard and marketplace traditions of performance, transforming Wellington\u2019s Aro Valley Park into a living, breathing garden of music, colour, and character. Audiences are invited to arrive early, explore the space, and meet the motley cast of lovers and fools before the story even begins. Expect song, sun, silliness, and the scent of summer roses.",

    "long_description": "MX-5 Rally\nMX-5 Rally - Sunday 15th Feb\n\nPlease note that this is a rally, and not a race. So, you need to follow provided instructions, and answer questions along the way correctly to win a prize. There is no prize for being the fastest. This rally has been organized for the Kapiti chapter of the MX-5 Club of NZ, but any other MX-5 drivers are welcome. Details below:\n\nWe will be meeting at the same place as last time - the Park 'n' Ride carpark at Manor Park, Lower Hutt, at 9am. Don't worry - we'll be doing completely different roads this time!\n\nThere is no breakfast at the start, but if people are interested, we could informally meet at Town & Country in Stokes Valley for breakfast beforehand,then all drive to the Park 'n' Ride together in convoy.\n\nYou will need to bring a pen or pencil, and something to press on, such as a clipboard, or a hardcover book. You will also need something you can take evidence photos with - a cellphone or digital camera will be fine.\n\nI also highly, highly recommend that you bring a co-driver, as it will make things infinitely easier for you. Call Russell on 021 0269 3224 if you have trouble finding a co-driver, as I can assist with that!\n\nLike last time, there will be prizes for 1st, 2nd & 3rd, but the prizes are based on who gets the most answers correct, and NOT on who is fastest to complete the course.\n\nLunch will be at the end point, so bring some $$$ with you.\n\nSnacks will again be provided along the way. This event is free for members of The Kapiti Chapter of the MX-5 Club of NZ, or $2 per car for non-members of that club. This will cover the cost of the provided snacks, plus the photocopying. Thanks.\n\nFurther instructions on the day, but if you attended the last rally I organised, then you'll know what to expect. You'll need about 1/2 a tank of gas.\n\nPlease RSVP to Russell by texting 021 0269 3224 by Friday 13 Feb, so I can ensure that there are enough printed instructions for everyone.\n\n",

The trauma and struggles often block the gifts and wisdom from flowing through us. The wisdom and gifts are where the breath of the Divine can give life to our soul's purpose. When we surrender our hold on the trauma, struggles, pain and hardships of our past, we make room for the Divine to flow in.\n\nIn these journeys, we surrender all of the building blocks of our identity.\n\nThis then creates space for the new gifts to be connected into our soul magic. Allowing the energy of the creator to rebuild our Souls to hold the strongest vibration of our infinite possibilities.\n\nWe will be gridding ourselves in the crystals from the tent, before the journey. After the journey, you will have some quiet time to write, draw or just reflect.\nThese journeys are deep and divine. Please come in comfortable clothing and ready to be changed for the better.\n\n",

    "long_description": "*Murder at Checkmate Manor Auditions*\n*AUDITION NOTICE *\n\nThe four hapless ladies of the Farndale Drama Guild (and their long-suffering stage manager) are putting on their overly-ambitious murder mystery play that would have Agatha Christie turning in her grave. Set at the remote country house, Checkmate Manor, a dastardly murderer is lurking about, killing people. The dirty rotter is trying to discover the contents of the late Sir Reginald Bishop\u2019s will to have the inheritance altered in their favour. And what better way to ensure they are the sole beneficiary than to bump of all of Bishop\u2019s relatives on the very night they\u2019re all gathered for the reading of the will.\nOpening night descends into chaos as scenery falls, costumes get mixed up, and the plot unravels, forcing the cast to improvise wildly.\nWhat the Farndale ladies lack in talent, they certainly make up for with fierce enthusiasm, an unfounded sense of ability and a surprisingly good souffle recipe.\n\nWe are seeking 5 actors to bring our play to life!\nCharacter Descriptions:\n\nMrs. Phoebe Reece: (50 +) The \"bossy\" leading figure and president of the group who attempts to direct and hold the chaotic production together. Has an underlying rivalry with Thelma which she tries (unsuccessfully) to mask. Must be able to do a French accent.\nPlays Clarissa Rook, (Lady Bishop\u2019s sister), Regine (the French maid), Patricia Bishop (Lady Bishop\u2019s niece), Leticia Bishop (her sister), Mr Goodbody (a solicitor)\n\nThelma: (50+) Mrs. Reece's rival, a dressmaker who is keen to show off her costume skills. Has a simmering dislike for Mrs Reece and is repelled by Gordan\u2019s advances. Ability to do a strong Yorkshire accent.\nPlays Daphne Bishop (Lady Bishop\u2019s daughter), Rose Bishop (her spinster Aunt)\n\nFelicity: A younger cast member. Plays two male parts. Not as stilted and awkward as Audrey or Gordon. Uses male voices\nPlays Pawn (the butler), Colonel King (Lady Bishop\u2019s brother-in-law)\n\n\nAudrey: A dithering, clumsy character who struggles with lines and delivery. Ability to do a strong Yorkshire accent.\nPlays Lady Doreen Bishop (a widow), Violet Bishop (her spinster aunt), Mrs King (the colonel\u2019s wife), Joan bishop (Lady Bishop\u2019s cousin)\n\nGordon: Roped in to play the inept inspector at the last minute and is clearly out of his comfort zone. A dry physicality needed and staccato utterances of lines (due to his inability to act)\nPlays Inspector O\u2019Reilly\n\n\n(Note; ages are just a guide. For this play, looking older is preferable. Parts are not suitable for young teenagers)\n\n\nThis is a play-within-a-play.\nCharacters often \u2018break the 4th wall\u2019 and \u2018break character\u2019. All characters interact with the audience to some extent. These characters are heavily nuanced \u2013 with the need for surreptitious, annoyed glances, double takes, etc. Have fun reading and getting into your character\u2019s head.\n\nAny questions or queries contact our Director Heidi Atkins via email or phone.\n027 733 4059\n\n",

Beginners should expect to spend at least $60 on materials for their ring-making project.

    "long_description": "STEAMS is an integrated approach to learning topics of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths, and Society that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. Its aim is to teach real world skills through engaging methods whilst allowing individuals to be creative. This involves immersing tamariki into projects and activities that develop innovation and champion curiosity. STEAMS is not \u2018play based learning\u2019 but focused learning through an integrated hands-on approach allowing children to take risks and explore their own curiosity in a subject without time barriers.\nAt the Ministry of Inspiration we offer STEAMS learning each term for Year 1-8 students. Once a week students will attend a class at Waterlea Racecourse, Blenheim on TUESDAY or THURSDAY. STEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) start at 9am and finish at 2:45pm on TUESDAY. Little STEAMerS operates from 9-12 on THURSDAY. STEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) operates on THURSDAY from 9am to 245 pm. \nInquiry, collaboration, and an emphasis on process-based learning are at the heart of the STEAM approach. Each term the classes will have a focus which drives the learning and our amazing teachers create opportunities to help each student develop their understanding, improve their skills and gain knowledge in a range of topics.\nStudents who participate in STEAM learning:\n\u00b7 think outside the box\n\u00b7 feel safe to express innovative and creative ideas\n\u00b7 feel comfortable doing hands-on learning\n\u00b7 take ownership over their learning\n\u00b7 work collaboratively with others\n\u00b7 understand the ways that science, maths, the arts, and technology work together\n\u00b7 become increasingly curious about the world around them and feel empowered to change it for the better.\nWhen does it meet, and where?\nThe school is held during school terms.\nSTEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) TUESDAY, 9-245.\nSTEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) THURSDAY, 9-245\nLittle STEAMerS (ages 5-6) THURSDAY 12-3.\nLocation:  Waterlea Racecourse, enter off of Linton St.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe students come for a paid three-week trial-as a new student you pay for that through Humanitix.\nIf both family and teacher feel there is a good fit for the child in the class, they continue for the rest of the term. You are then invoiced for the full term less the amount paid for the Trial.\nPayment is by term, with a cost of $73 incl. GST We have a limited number of scholarships available that are awarded on a term by term basis for those with financial need for 25% off. \nLittle STEAMerS is $30 incl. GST.\nWill my child\u2019s school mind that they miss a day per week?\nYou will need to inform the child\u2019s school that he or she will be at STEAMS School one day per week. To date we have not encountered any issues around accommodating a child\u2019s participation in STEAMS School, and many of the region\u2019s schools are very supportive of the programme. Once enrolled, you are encouraged to inform the teacher and office staff that your child should be marked present for the day they attend STEAMS School, as they will be attending an academic school as opposed to being absent due to illness or other reasons.",

    "long_description": "Spoon Show @ NZ Fringe 2026\nAh, the humble kitchen spoon. So soft, so harmless, so simple.\n\nA spoon can become many things. An airplane, an embrace, a swip-swap creating willy sords or perhaps two swords? A loved one, an enemy, a catapult, a shamefully niche musical instrument. Can a clown be a spoon? What actually IS a spoon, really? Does a spork count? Ponder these deep questions and more as Fumble the Clown explores the infinite comedic potential of cutlery.\n\nIt is unclear where the clown got so many of these metal wonders, or for what purpose. But with a fool\u2019s brain, a dancer\u2019s body and a determination usually reserved only for the truly idiotic, this charming clown will joke, dance, juggle (badly), sing and invite their audience to join the show, creating an unforgettable hour of ridiculous comedy.\n\nSpoon Show is the sophomore solo work created by award-winning Aotearoa-based dancer-turned-clown Daniel Nodder, whose work has been described as a \u201ctour-de-force\u201d, \u201cbeyond human\u201d and \u201cpure artistry\u201d. After developing this new work at \u00c9cole Philippe Gaulier, Daniel brings all of their absurdist comedy and multi-award-winning movement skills to this performance. Performing alongside quirky sound design & composition by Ben Kelly and clever technical design by Rebekah de Roo, this production is a perfectly balanced spoonful of comedy soup.\n\nBe delighted by the simple stupidity and ironic inventiveness of a show about spoons.\n\nPrevious awards won by Daniel Nodder:\nWINNER: Outstanding Performance Award - Dunedin Fringe 2025 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Dance / Physical Theatre Award - Dunedin Fringe 2025 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Artist's Pick Award - San Diego International Fringe 2024 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Outside the Box Award - San Diego International Fringe 2024 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance - New Zealand Fringe 2023 (Only Bones)\nNOMINATED: Best in Fringe - New Zealand Fringe 2023 & 2025 (Only Bones; Entry: Encounter)\nNOMINATED: Performer of the Year - Wellington Theatre Awards 2023 (Only Bones)\n\n",

    "long_description": "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention initially developed for emotional disorders. It is now widely used in supporting people to deal with the challenges of physical ill-health. Professionals from various backgrounds can learn to use a simplified CBT skills set, and use of these skills enables them to be more effective in managing aspects of their patients\u2019 distress.\nThe training is a mix of theory, skills demonstration and skills practice, giving participants a better understanding of the applicability of the skill set in their area of practice and providing some skills to take away. Training sessions are spaced to allow participants to use their new skills in their clinical practice. Each participant reflects on their learning and their work with a specific patient, and the whole group reflects on lessons learned. In this way, learning remains rooted in participants\u2019 clinical practice. These CBT courses are consistently evaluated highly by participants.\nThe Course\nTeaching will be commenced with 2 days of in person sessions. 19th and 20th Feb 2026 at Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington and subsequently 2 sessions on-line via Zoom. The online sessions will be on 8th April and 27th May at 5pm for 3.5 hours.\nAttendance at all sessions is mandatory to complete the course.\nThe courses cost is $850 per person (incl GST).\nThe Trainers\nKathy Burn was a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Palliative Care who went on to train in CBT and to develop the CBT service at St Christopher\u2019s Hospice, London. She now works in CBT in chronic pain, and she teaches and supervises CBT trainees at the institute of Psychiatry, London.\nKathryn Mannix was a Palliative Medicine Consultant and CBT therapist. She developed \u2018CBT First Aid\u2019 to enable palliative care clinicians to adapt skills from CBT into their clinical practice. She is an author. There are insights into her use of CBT in her books With the End in Mind and Listen.\nTerms and Conditions\nAttendance: In order to create a learning community for each course, it is important that each person on a course attends every session and is able to join in the discussions by keeping up with the course. By accepting a place on a particular course, you agree to attend all the sessions, to arrive on time, and to work alongside your group members during the session to support each other's learning. Each session builds on the last, and you'll be asked to put your new learning into practice in- between sessions. Building learning groups in this way means we can't add new trainees after a course has begun.\nWe are not able to run catch-up sessions for sessions missed. If you miss sessions, you may be asked to withdraw from the course and no refunds will be given.\nRefunds/Canellations: Once you sign up and pay, we won't be able to refund your payment unless we can reallocate your place to another person before the course begins. The deadline for cancelling your place is 28 days before the day and time of the first session. If you cancel and we can fill your place with another person, we'll offer you the choice of a refund or a place on a future course, if places are available. We will do our best to fill your place, but we can't promise this. Refunds will incur an administration fee.\nDates and Times of Sessions: all dates and times are given in NZ time, and this varies over the year. It is up to you to check the correct time in your time zone: you may find this website useful to check your own time zone with Auckland NZ time on each specific date: https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/\nTrainers: we have a team of trainers, all of whom are experienced CBT therapists and trainers, and all are familiar with applying CBT in physical health settings. Different sessions may be taught by different trainers, or by 'guest appearances' by some of our team. The team of trainers will ensure there is continuity of content and of learning as the course progresses.\nSpecial circumstances: Sometimes, life events appear unexpectedly. If something unexpected prevents you from attending, please let us know as early as you can, and we will give consideration to how we might be able to support you to continue your training if that is what you wish to do.",

    "long_description": "[OFFSITE] Jim White (Aus) & Marisa Anderson (US) with Motte + UMU\nOffsite at Meow, 9 Edward Street, Wellington\n\nJim White & Marisa Anderson\nThe collaboration between renowned drummer Jim White (Dirty Three, PJ Harvey, Bonnie Prince Billy, Cat Power) and acclaimed US guitarist Marisa Anderson is a natural union of two of the most intuitive players and listeners working in music. White and Anderson are both in high demand as collaborators, in no small part because of their mastery, versatility and highly expressive playing. The duo have amassed an impressive body of work together (including their 2020 debut The Quickening and 2024\u2019s Swallowtail), and each remain at the vanguard of their practices due to an insatiable curiosity and delight in exploration of new avenues of expression.\n\n---\n\nMarisa Anderson channels the history of the guitar and stretches the boundaries of tradition. Her playing is fluid, emotional, and masterful, featuring compositions and improvisations that re-imagine the landscape of American music. Her work applies elements of minimalism, electronic music, drone and 20th century classical music to compositions based on blues, jazz, gospel and country music.\n\n---\n\nDrummer Jim White first come to attention in the mid-1990s with the acclaimed Australian instrumental trio Dirty Three, and is now recognised internationally as one of the most creative and expressive drummers on the planet. His unique playing style and deft way with sound and rhythm has seen him become the go-to drummer for a huge number of alt-A-list vocalists with collaboration in mind. PJ Harvey has said there is ballet in White\u2019s light, precise touch. And the other collaborators that he\u2019s mesmerised, including the likes of Bonnie Prince Billy, Smog, Nick Cave, White Magic, Beth Orton, Marianne Faithfull, Kurt Vile, Cat Power and the iconic Cretan lyra player Psarantonis, all know that there\u2019s more to White\u2019s drumming than mere accompaniment. His intuitive beats and singular approach have created sparks in his collaborations. Whoever White is playing with, he is right there, present in the most inspirational sense.\n\n---\n\nMotte is the solo project of violinist and composer, Anita Clark. Riding the thin line between beauty and devastation, Motte weaves together a richly textured world with a violin, delay pedal, sampled sound and voice. Creating a world solely her own, the sound is modern classical, ambient, alt/experimental pop and improvised noise. Her musical gifts and skilful reach across genres makes her an indispensable collaborator with The Phoenix Foundation, Luke Buda, Marlon Williams, Don McGlashan, the Renderers, Nadia Reid, Lawrence Arabia, Delaney Davidson and plenty of others. As Motte, she dances around the shining candescence of her culture like a night insect, always seeking a better vantage point to the light.\n\n---\n\nUMU is a duo of Riki Gooch and Daniel Beban. Silver Apples meets Kuduro with Riki's deep grooves played on an 80s Roland electronic drum kit which are manipulated and dubbed out by Dan on two Tama Techstar drum synths.\n\n$35 earlybird tickets via Meow / $20 unwaged\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

    "long_description": "USUI REIKI LEVEL TWO IN KAPITI with Heartsong\nLevel Two Usui Reiki is a significant development on from Level One. Get in touch to enquire. You can study Level Two with me if you had your Level One attunement elsewhere.\n\nThis TWO DAY course offers 10 hours of in person training, a full manual, certificate of completion, a follow up Zoom call and ongoing support. Maximum of 6 participants to enable close support and interaction.\n\nLevel 2 involves a new powerful attunement and learning new techniques such as Distance Reiki, sacred reiki symbols, and preparing for working on people you may not know. You can start charging for your Reiki services after completing level two.\n\nWe learn about three Reiki symbols and practice drawing them. By Day 2 it is expected that you have memorized how to draw Level 2 Symbols (I teach with a gap between day 1&2 so this is very achievable).\n\nBecoming competent at distance healing is a significant priority of Level 2 training and we will have plenty of practice doing this. Distance healing is practiced on people and animals. Basic business set up is discussed.\n\nAdvanced Practitioner Level Reiki is a great tool if you want to feel centered in your life, it helps to balance and align our energy bodies, and can cause positive changes in many areas of our lives. Reiki can be used to help heal a wide number of conditions and to initiate and support positive life changes. Further details on enquiry. Reiki Level 2 opens you to a deeper channel of healing energy and enables you to offer healing professionally.\n\nDates are specially chosen to be auspicious in relation to the moon and cosmic energies\n\nSaturday FEBRUARY 21ST, 10.am-4.30pm\n\nSaturday MARCH 14TH, 10am-4.30pm\n\nThe gap in between the two training days allows you to receive support as you experience the 21 day 'cleanse' and integration period after the Reiki attunement - and also enable time to work on developing and practicing the material learnt in the first days training.\n\nTotal of 12 hours tuition time plus some at home practice/study required.\n\nLight simple shared lunches are provided - you will need to bring a contribution.\n\nHerbal teas and light snacks are also provided.\n\nLocation: Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Corner of Aorangi and Tutanekai Streets, Paraparaumu\n\nPre-enrollment questionnaire -\n\nInvestment:\n\n\u00a3555 for full TWO day course, training, all support materials including manual, certificate, light healthy lunch, refreshments and ongoing support. Plus extra hours online in follow up Zoom call on 21st day.\n\nPay in Full Here - https://buy.stripe.com/9B628q2W4ahTghqdcKew81V\n\nA non-refundable $155 deposit secures your place - book here: https://buy.stripe.com/eVqcN4bsA89LaX6b4Cew81S\n\nThere is a payment plan available - contact me\n\nBryony is a Usui Reiki Master Teacher and she has 27 years healing experience. She loves teaching this precious, versatile healing skill and it gives her great pleasure to offer this training in Lancaster\n\nBryony says:\nReiki has had a powerful positive influence on my life, helping me to heal and change mindset, physical and emotional conditions, and to see life in a new light. Reiki helped with my recovery from Chronic Fatigue syndrome and Depression \u2764 I will share this with you in this course and help you open your life to the positive transformation that Reiki can bring.\n\nIf you are interested in coming on this course, please contact me by email at to receive a questionnaire to answer which gives me a sense of your interest, previous experience of Reiki healing and conditions I should be aware of.\n\nCancellation Policy:\n\nIf Heartsong Healing needs to cancel the course all payments are refunded.

It governs our sense of safety, stability, belonging, and connection to the physical world \u2014 home, body, trust, finances, and basic needs. By strengthening this energetic centre, we cultivate resilience, stability, and a deeper sense of being held and supported in life. When it\u2019s out of balance, we may experience anxiety, restlessness, fatigue, or a sense of disconnection.\nThis workshop is an invitation to slow down, reconnect with your body, and strengthen your inner foundation through movement, breath, sound, and rest.\n\n\ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Kundalini Yoga - to awaken and stabilise the root chakra: 1.30pm \u2013 3.00pm\n\u2615 Break: Herbal tea, healthy snack & oracle cards\n\ud83c\udfb6 Gong Bath - a restorative practice to settle the body and mind: 3.30pm \u2013 4.30pm\n\n\u2728 Come for one session or enjoy the full workshop experience.\n\n\ud83d\udcabOpen to all levels \u2013 no experience with yoga or sound healing needed.\n\n\ud83d\udcab Bring an open heart, a yoga mat, blanket, water bottle and anything you need to feel cozy + supported.\n\nInvestment:\n$35 Yoga | $30 Gong Bath | $55 Both\n\n\ud83c\udf3fLay down strong roots, regulate your nervous system, and begin a year-long journey of energy awareness and self-connection.\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 01:30 PM - 03:00 PM\nKundalini Yoga | $35\nInfo: Move, breathe, and reset your energy with a nourishing Kundalini Yoga practice to clear the mind, reset your energy, and reconnect with your body.

We acknowledge Taranaki wh\u0101nui, and all the peoples who have lived here, and their close relationship with the lands and waters.\n\n\nThe Capital City Complex Systems Symposium 2026 will explore cutting-edge knowledge of complex systems and complexity, and how this knowledge is being used to better understand systems and drive system change. It will be held in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand, during summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe theme for the conference is \u2018Understanding complex systems: Theory, practice and impact\u2019.\n\nOur programme, including speakers, can be viewed here\n\nFollowing the success of previous symposia in 2023 and 2024, this event will continue to foster interdisciplinary, cross-sector and cross-society collaboration in complex systems thinking, research and action.

A particular focus will be how complexity science has evolved and how it is informing contemporary actions and solutions for prosperous, resilient, equitable and democratic societies \u2013 amid growing global challenges.\nThe symposium will explore complexity through a rich interdisciplinary lens, bringing together philosophical and epistemological perspectives alongside practical insights from fields including artificial intelligence, infrastructure, health, education, climate, and the environment, and cutting-edge insights from M\u0101ori and local communities. Attendees will engage with understandings of complexity, examine innovative methods and tools for working within complex systems, and discuss the implications for public policy, governance, leadership and Indigenous system change.\nThis inclusive, supportive event is essential for anyone interested in understanding the trajectory and practical applications of complex systems knowledge \u2014 including researchers, leaders, policymakers, innovators, changemakers, practitioners, and students.

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

Run by mums, for mums, we support and connect women facing the changes and challenges of being a mum through discussion groups. We also consider the impact motherhood has on other aspects of life, including relationships, career and sense of wellbeing.\nIncluded in your workshop\nYou will be guided by Lara Phillips, a trained creative facilitator in Interactive Drawing Therapy, through drawing prompts (similar to a guided meditation or journaling) to draw out where you are at and draw out your own inner guidance. No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these fun and friendly workshops.\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a way of wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz.\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing.

    "long_description": "\"Faster and faster. And for a long time you wouldn't feel anything. And then you'd burst into fire\" - Laura Palmer\nTWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME.\nDAVID LYNCH | USA & FRANCE | 1992 | 135mins | R18+| 4K DCP PROVIDED BY JANUS FILMS DISTRIBUTION\nJoin us for this very special community fundraiser screening of the prequel to the critically acclaimed series, \"Twin Peaks\".\nABC cancelled the original series after season 2 but a month later, Lynch announced he was \"not yet finished with the material\" and principal photography for the full length prequel film, began on September 5th 1991 at a caravan site in Snoqualmie Washington. Which became the \"Fat Trout Trailer Park\" where the story of the last 7 days of Laura Palmer begins.\nSince its showing at the 1992 Festival De Cannes, no other Lynch film had polarized audiences to such an extent. Fans that wanted more \"Cherry Pie\" and \"Donuts\" from the TV show were served a much darker, unflinching and unforgiving work - in Lynch's own words, a movie about \"the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim\". Derided by critics and many fans at the time it was a commercial box office flop.\nYet in the years since the initial reaction, a gradual wave of reappraisal and appreciation began. With time it's brilliance came into focus with growing acknowledgment, that the film is a more accurate, complex and powerful account of trauma. Combining the dramatic ferocity of Sherly Lee's tour de force and the beauty of Angelo Badalamenti's score, Lynch reclaimed full ownership of the material creating a harrowing, compassionate and enigmatic hymn to Laura Palmer.\nAs we approach the films 34 year anniversary and since Lynch's passing in 2025, it is now regarded by critics and fans worldwide, as a revered epilogue, essential predecessor to \"The Return\", and Lynch's most chilling, terrifying, and yet empathetic and humane cinematic masterpiece.\nWHERE: The Roxy Cinema. 5 Park Road. Miramar. Wellington.\nCinema 1 - The big cinema upstairs with the massive screen, red italian leather sofas, and of course those red curtains!\nWHEN: Wed 25th Feb 2026.

    "long_description": "This summer, Eastbourne\u2019s prize-winning Butterfly Creek Theatre Troupe proudly celebrates its 30th year of Shakespeare with a strikingly contemporary production of King Lear. In this two-hour adaptation the tragedy is sharpened to its core: the fraught family dynamics of Lear and Gloucester, two parents whose misguided choices unleash betrayal and heartbreak. Lear\u2019s reckless division of his kingdom and Gloucester\u2019s misplaced trust in her children reveal how pride and blindness can devastate generations. Performed as the sun sets on a summer evening\u2014with the adjacent school hall ready should the weather turn\u2014this production offers a fresh perspective on parental folly, loyalty, and love, making Shakespeare\u2019s timeless themes resonate anew.\nThe show will be presented to a seated audience in the school courtyard. It can get chilly so wrap warmly but it will move indoors in poor weather. There is a bar (cash or Eftpos). Parking in the school grounds accessible from Oroua Street.\nWarning: The play contains graphic violence.",

Before we\u2019re even conscious of it, we label, compartmentalise or judge - and it can be a real struggle to relish our own bodies when this judgment happens in front of a mirror. \nThe Stories of Our Bodies is an affirming and liberating circle, firmly\nheld in dignity, that redirects this judgement towards positive body image and bodily autonomy. This workshop builds on the living lineage of Australian Radical Faerie elder Uncle Teacosy. It is shaped from gay men\u2019s survival of the 90\u2019s AIDS epidemic, evolved to uplift queer&trans communities and has been offered internationally by only one facilitator.\nEach participant is invited into deep connection with their body and then in turn, we share the stories of our bodies from birth til now, removing as many articles of clothing as we choose. Stories often include histories of illness, injury, gender affirmation, addiction, aging, intentional modification, shape, ability or size\nWhat stories can the marks and folds of a body tell when witnessed in belonging and respect? How can we uplift each story and every storyteller?\nThis circle is for participants from the Takat\u0101pui, MVPFAFF+, LGBTQIA+ communities, active in engaged consent and includes partial or full nudity in a non-sexual atmosphere.\nYour Facilitators: Eleven Greenstones and val smith\nEleven Greenstones (she/they, Pakeha) is a cultural worker, community educator, researcher, gardener and facilitator who seeks deep and fertile justice by cultivating rich soil and robust, adaptive communities. For three decades, Eleven has informed and performed behind a radio desk, on stage, in community centres and cultural hubs. Her work spans the Pacific Ocean including in Aotearoa, Australia, Timor Leste, China, Korea, Mongolia and the US: educating in high schools, AOD rehabs, hospitals, police stations, co-housing cooperatives, squatted warehouses, international language schools and mentoring in arts workshops and community gardens.\nEleven is a life-long student, recently in decolonial Fieldwork with Leah Manaema Avene and with H\u00e9ctor Aristiz\u00e1bal, founder of ImaginAction. They\u2019ve studied post-activism with fugitive philosopher Bayo Akomolafe, Generative Somatics and Undoing Racism\u00ae (People\u2019s Institute for Survival and Beyond). They\u2019ve been mentored by First Nations ecologists to work for a living planet, Undoing White Supremacy Austin (Texas) to design and deliver anti-racism \u2018unlearning circles\u2019 and by Radial Faerie elders to facilitate liberating spaces for the LGBTQIA+ community.\nval smith (P\u0101keh\u0101, they/them) is a choreographic artist-researcher and educator based in T\u0101maki Makaurau, Aotearoa. Their practice engages critical somatics and friendship-based collaboration to explore the socio-political dimensions of whiteness, queerness, and transness within the cultural context of Aotearoa. Recent performance work investigates more-than-human kinship, queer intimacies, and temporalities in relationship with marginal urban places.\nval\u2019s teaching and facilitation engages with community, secondary and tertiary learning environments. They have a Postgraduate Diploma in Dance and Drama Secondary Teaching, and have worked with kids, young people with disabilities, the Disability dance sector, older folks, as well as queer and trans communities. They teach somatic practices, improvisation, performance skills, critical dance, yoga, creative practice and research methodologies.\nA recipient of the Arts Foundation Laureate Award (2019), val was also the 2016 Caroline Plummer Fellow at Te Whare W\u0101nanga o \u014ct\u0101kou, University of Otago, where they undertook a community dance project with the local queer community.",

    "long_description": "INTRODUCING AOTEAROA'S NEWEST FUNDRAISING EVENT: RETHINK\nRETHINK Fundraising 2026 invites you and your team to look at your fundraising programme from a fresh perspective.\nJoin us for a full day of inspirational talks, panel discussions and practical workshops that will leave you energised, AND armed with a toolkit of actionable learnings to take your fundraising to the next level.\nDate: Thursday, 5 March\nVenue: M\u0101karo Room, Wharewaka Function Centre\nTime: 8am-5pm\nCost: $249NZD (exc GST)*\nContact: Anna Shere anna@changeand.co\n*If you prefer to pay via invoice, please email accounts@changeand.co.\nTHE PROGRAMME\nFor those of you who joined us for RETHINK Auckland 2025, please note that RETHINK Wellington will feature many of the same sessions from that event, with a few additions to the programme and two new guest speakers.\nBranding blindspots \nIn a sector focused on campaigns, conversion, and compliance, brand is often overlooked. But brand isn\u2019t just a logo or a nice story. It\u2019s how people feel about supporting you. And if it's not clear, engaging, or modern \u2013 you\u2019re leaving both money and meaning on the table. This presentation from Tim Dove at re:brand will challenge a few norms and show some examples of it being done well. He\u2019ll get you thinking about your organisation and how you can ensure you\u2019re avoiding the \u2018brand blindspot\u2019. \nRethinking charity comms \nWhen it comes to getting people enthused about our cause, too often we focus on the what rather than the why. Worse, we risk boring our audience to death with earnest, organisation-centric communications which neither inspire nor instruct. Dominique Antarakis from Change&Co will show you a new and fun way to look at your charity comms for maximum engagement and donor retention.  \nWorkshop 1 \nFacilitated workshop which will provide the opportunity to take the learnings from the morning sessions and give you the practical branding and comms tools to take back to your organisation - and transform your fundraising! \nLunch break  \nTake a break, mix and mingle, and enjoy a fabulous lunch selection.\nData, behaviour, and hyper-personalisation \nThis presentation from MIMO/DATAM will show you how to transform raw data into meaningful, multi-channel interactions across email, SMS, voice, and direct mail - all from a single platform. This session will challenge how you think about personalisation - it\u2019s not just about names in subject lines or open rates in eDMs, it\u2019s about burning down the old school campaigns and rebuilding around behaviour, context and connection. \nLessons from the legacy frontlines \nBased on interviews with practitioners from organisations large and small, this session shares unfiltered insights from Gift in Will managers who are doing the work every day\u2014what's actually generating pledges, where they're getting stuck, and what they wish they'd known sooner. Through their collective wisdom, and guided by TEDIREX\u2019s Martin Ruane, we'll explore the biggest challenges facing legacy programs today, the opportunities hiding in plain sight, and tactical takeaways that work for both beginners and experienced practitioners. \nWorkshop 2 \nFacilitated workshop which will provide the opportunity to take the learnings from the afternoon sessions and give you the practical personalisation and AI tools to ramp up acquisition and retention.  \nCFRE ACCREDITATION\nFull participation in RETHINK Fundraising is applicable for 7 points in Category 1.B -Education of the CFRE International application for initial certification and/or recertification.\nEVENT PARTNERS\nChange&Co, DATAM, mimo, re:brand and Tedirex. Special thanks to FIA/FINZ for their support of the day.\nRETHINK has been designed by fundraisers for fundraisers, and we\u2019re keen to make sure you get the most out of the day. We promise no hard-sell, no product placement, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee.\nThe idea is for you to leave at the end of the day with a roadmap to greater donor engagement \u2013 and a sense of renewed energy for what lies ahead.",

In this performance, AoJO honours the essence of Gershwin\u2019s original while re-examining the work through a modern big band lens \u2014 expanding its orchestral colours, rhythmic drive, and improvisational possibilities for today\u2019s audiences.\n\nAoJO Musical Director John Rae says the orchestra approached the piece with both respect and curiosity:\n\n\u201cGershwin was writing music that looked forward, not backward. Our aim with this version of Rhapsody in Blue is to treat it the same way, to honour the original while allowing it to speak in a contemporary jazz language that feels alive right now.\u201d\n\nThe performance features pianist Ben Wilcock, widely regarded as one of Aotearoa\u2019s leading jazz artists, whose international career spans Europe, the UK, and New Zealand.\n\n\u201cBen brings an incredible combination of authority, imagination, and openness to this music,\u201d says Rae. \u201cHe understands Gershwin from the inside out, and he\u2019s not afraid to take risks, which is exactly what this piece demands.\u201d\n\nWilcock has been praised internationally for his distinctive musical voice: \u201cWilcock combines dazzling technical command with a rare sense of musical narrative \u2014 his playing is both fearless and deeply expressive.\u201d \u2014 All About Jazz\n\nAnother review described him as \u201cA pianist of remarkable clarity and imagination, equally at home in classical repertoire and cutting-edge jazz.\u201d\n\nAlongside this project, AoJO continues its broader mission of developing large-ensemble jazz in Aotearoa and creating meaningful performance opportunities for local musicians.\n\n\u201cThe Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra exists to celebrate, develop, and present contemporary large-ensemble jazz in Aotearoa \u2014 supporting our musicians, engaging new audiences, and placing this music in a living cultural context rather than a museum one.\u201d\n\nEvent details\nWhat: Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra: Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue\nFeaturing: Ben Wilcock (piano)\nWhere: Meow Nui, Wellington\nWhen: Friday 6 March 2026, 7.00pm",

He will also make a solo appearance at Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, where he joins He Manu T\u012boriori, a celebration of waiata reo M\u0101ori, on Saturday 21 March.\nAt the centre of Amber Skies is Muroki\u2019s drive for freedom and new experiences. He believes music only really happens when he is fully living, pushing into new environments, meeting people and adding what he calls seasoning to life. \nThe album was written and recorded between Aotearoa and Berlin, with production by Djeisan Suskov, Justyn Pilbrow and Josh Fountain, and featuring Len Blake and keyboard virtuoso Joe Kaptein. \nMuroki is immersed in the Berlin scene, regularly jamming with musicians including members of Parcels, Rikas and the Zen Men, finding grounding in a city that can be both electric and mellow. He filmed the video for latest single Break It Down in Portugal with director Ezra Simons (Earth Tongue), shot entirely on 16mm film in Peniche and Nazar\u00e9, and also returned to Kenya for the first time since he was sixteen, reconnecting with wh\u0101nau and gaining perspective during this chapter.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been bouncing between places while working on this album. Living nomadically keeps me open and curious. Nothing beats coming back to Aotearoa, and I can\u2019t wait to play these songs live with the band.\u201d\nWith platinum success on Wavy, the Triple J topping Love Cocoon with BENEE and collaborations with LEISURE, Young Franco and NASAYA, Muroki returns home ready to take these songs to the stage.",

For this celebratory concert, the choir is joined by taonga p\u016boro artist Horomona Horo, leading instrumentalists, and a chamber ensemble from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. \nThe concert centrepiece is Robert Wiremu\u2019s Re-imagined Mozart: Erebus. The programme also features a new commission from Takerei Komene, as well as waiata by Ng\u0101p\u014d and Pimia Wehi. This highlights Dr Grylls\u2019 pioneering collaborations that reshaped Aotearoa\u2019s choral landscape. Her expertise as a choral clinician is sought internationally, and she regularly conducts masterclasses and workshops in Wales, England, North America, Canada and Australia. \nThis marks Dr Grylls\u2019 final appearance as Music Director of Voices New Zealand.

    "long_description": "EC-MENz vision is for men fully participating at all levels of Early Childhood Education to represent the diversity of our society in Aotearoa.\nThe EC-MENz Summit 2026 is kindly being hosted and supported by Childspace.\n\nT\u0101ne, w\u0101hine, and irawhiti are warmly invited to participate in a special day of high quality, affordable professional learning. This celebration of gender diversity in ECE will be held in a safe and supportive environment and is a fantastic opportunity to meet others in the profession, share your own story, and be inspired.\nGender Steretoypes in ECE - Mike Collin and Max Christie\nWhat can gender stereotypes teach us about teaching and learning?\nEarly childhood education relies on diversity within teaching teams. Yet, gender stereotypes often shape how we see ourselves and each other as kaiako. This interactive session invites educators to explore the hidden assumptions that influence teaching roles and team dynamics. In this session, Max and Mike will unpack how stereotypes impact collaboration and how every kaiako adds unique value to teaching teams. Participants will leave with practical strategies to challenge bias, strengthen team culture, and celebrate the richness of varied approaches in ECE settings.\nMike Collin (B. Ed)\nBeing a new grad, Mike harnesses a fresh perspective underpinned by recent research and hands on learning. Mike is currently a kaiako within Heretaunga Kindergarten Association, nurturing the lives of our future generations to come.\nMike changed career paths having found his passion for teaching young tamariki. He believes in kaiako being the best versions of themselves to enhance positive and\nmeaningful learning environments for tamariki, advocating for the professionalism which early childhood kaiako achieve everyday. Mike strives for excellence in his approach to teaching and learning, seeking out the best outcomes for tamariki.\nMax Christie (M. Ed)\nMax brings over a decade of experience in early childhood education, blending academic expertise with hands-on leadership. Max currently lectures at EIT Te Aho a M\u0101ui, where he inspires future educators through a commitment to quality ECE for tamariki and wh\u0101nau.\nHe began his teaching journey at Childspace Northland, where he also gained leadership experience and has facilitated PLD internationally and across Aotearoa. Max is deeply passionate about nature-based education, play, te ao M\u0101ori, leadership, innovative and affirming the mana of tamariki and kaiako.\nAutism NZ - Thecla Moffat\nMen can change the dynamics of play in ECE benefiting autistic tamariki\nMale kaiako often bring more energy in the ECE setting with an emphasis on more physical activity, outdoor play, \"rough and tumble\" play, and positive risk-taking, which appeals to both boys and girls and provides a different dimension to play than may be beneficial to most autistic tamariki. We now know that through fun and engaging interactions kaiako help enhance the autistic tamariki pivotal capacities for later learning. In this talk kaiako will get to know how men in ECE with their positive energy can make a difference through play for autistic tamariki in their centres. The kaiako will be given a few strategies of how to do that and some ideas to encourage tuakana-teina (peer play) between autistic tamariki and their non-autistic peers will be shared.\nThecla Moffat (Early Intervention Manager, Autism New Zealand) is an educator who has been in the teaching field for over three decades. Thecla is passionate about inclusion and advocate for children\u2019s rights and needs to be met in their educational settings.\nThecla has experience teaching from early childhood to primary school. She joined the tertiary sector in educating New Zealand\u2019s teachers between January 2013 and October 2015 working as a lecturer at New Zealand Tertiary College. In her first year at New Zealand Tertiary College, she wrote the course guide for Inclusive Education Level 7. In October 2015 she joined the New Zealand Ministry of Education as an Early Intervention Specialist. In August 2019 Thecla joined Autism New Zealand to start their new early intervention services. She has a huge interest in inclusive education for children with diverse needs and promoting emotional and social competencies in the early years with special interest in autistic children. She has done research in inclusive early childhood education and promoting children\u2019s social competencies. She sits on the Teaching Council Inclusive Education Advisory Group and currently sits on the academic programme board for New Zealand Tertiary College among other roles. She is a parent to three amazing children one of whom is neurodiverse. theclamoffat@xtra.co.nz OR thecla.moffat@autismnz.org.nz\nSelf-regulation & positive behaviour strategies - Robert Jensen & Nikki Wilson\nENGAGE is an evidence-based approach that supports the development of children\u2019s self-regulation skills through intentional play. ENGAGE was developed by Professor Dione Healey (University of Otago) and has been widely researched in Aotearoa.\nIn collaboration with Methodist Mission Southern (MMS) and funding from the Ministry of Education, the programme is now being delivered across Aotearoa to equip tamariki with self-regulation skills to support successful navigation through school and beyond.\nRobert & Nikki are ENGAGE facilitators for the Te Whanganui-a-Tara region.\nPlay is good for you! - Robin Christie\nThe reciprocal nature of learning between child and adult relies on a shared language - the language of play. This universal language is unspoken, and is strongest in the presence of curious, wondrous, joyous educators. You are already fluent in this language, and the amazing diversity of playful approaches you bring to your ECE setting is a huge strength of our profession! This entertaining and thought- provoking session will reinforce the importance of playful adults in children's learning, examine the research around the role of humour in human development, and share practical tips for staying playful every day.\nRobin Christie is an early childhood teacher, playscape designer, and the co-founder of Childspace Early Learning Centres in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Wellington, Aotearoa/ New Zealand. He is passionate about creativity in the early years, developing empowering learning environments, and getting more good men into ECE. You can get hold of him anytime on robin@childspace.nz .",

It captures Maltese at his most personal, trading irony for honesty and humour for vulnerability.\n\nMuch like kindred spirits Randy Newman and Father John Misty, beneath Maltese\u2019s sumptuous melodies and classic pop craftsmanship there\u2019s always a lyric that stops you in your tracks \u2013 sometimes breaking your heart, sometimes making you laugh. Across the album\u2019s eleven tracks, Maltese\u2019s trademark wit is still present but wielded with restraint, often emerging through self-deprecation and quiet revelation.\n\nHaving first established himself in 2018 with his debut Bad Contestant, Maltese has since evolved into one of the UK\u2019s finest young songwriters. The albums that followed cemented his reputation for transforming the mundane into something dream-like, his piano harmonies, playful lyricism and quintessentially British wit resonating around the world.\n\nIn late 2024, Maltese embarked on a headline tour across Asia, Australia and New Zealand, following sold-out runs through the US, Europe and the UK \u2013 including his biggest performances to date at The Wiltern in Los Angeles and London\u2019s Electric Brixton. With Hers, he now steps into an even bigger chapter: playing to larger rooms than ever before and connecting with an audience that continues to grow from Sydney to S\u00e3o Paulo, Jakarta to Tokyo.\n\nAudiences can expect an enchanting live experience that blends Maltese\u2019s new material with an favourites spanning his six-album catalogue \u2013 poetic, wry, and unashamedly human.\n\n",

It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

    "long_description": "Presented by: 95bFM & Eccles Entertainment\nGrammy and Academy Award\u2013winning songwriter, composer and performer Bret McKenzie has announced two highly anticipated dates in his homeland of New Zealand in support of his latest album, Freak Out City. Touching down in Wellington and Auckland this April, the shows follow a run of sold-out international concerts and mark McKenzie\u2019s long-awaited return to New Zealand stages. Best known as one half of Flight of the Conchords, Bret McKenzie has built an acclaimed solo career defined by sharp wit, impeccable musicianship and a deep love of classic songwriting. \nFollowing his solo debut Songs Without Jokes, Bret released his second project, Freak Out City, in August 2025 via Sub Pop Records.

    "long_description": "The \u201cMysticssippi Blues Man\u201d and one of Canada\u2019s most revered and distinctive musical voices brings his world-renowned live show to New Zealand audiences!\nHarry Manx has spent decades carving out a singular musical path. He is known for his extraordinary ability to fuse deep blues grooves with the spiritual depth of Indian classical music. Switching effortlessly between slide guitar, harmonica, banjo, and the remarkable Mohan veena \u2014 a 20-stringed instrument taught to him by Indian master Vishwa Mohan Bhatt \u2014 Manx creates performances that are immersive, transportive, and deeply human.\n\u201cA seamless fit between blues and Indian classical music\u201d - DownBeat Magazine\n\u201cDeliciously addictive\" - The New York Times\n\u201cCanada\u2019s most expressive blues player\u201d - Billboard Magazine\n\ud83d\udccd Friday 03 April @ The Little Theatre - Lower Hutt\n7pm doors / 7:30pm show\nSeated Concert\n2 x 45 minute sets with intermission\n$59 Early Bird Tickets (very limited)\nDON'T miss your chance to see live music at it's finest!\n\n\u201cWatching Harry play tonight I feel like I learned something new \u2026. \u201d\nBruce Springsteen\nHarry Manx is an artist that critics have occasionally had a hard time getting their minds around. His unique amalgam of blues and other American roots music, classical Indian forms, and bits of rock, pop, and folk makes him difficult to pigeonhole, and self-appointed gatekeepers of those traditions sometimes bemoan his lack of purity, stubbornly missing the point. But Manx\u2019s trip is really quite easy to grasp: He\u2019s an accomplished and adventurous lap-slide guitarist \u2013 whether playing a National resonator, a solidbody lap-steel, a modified banjo or cigar-box guitar, or his signature 20-string Mohan Veena \u2013 and a compelling singer with a rich, warm, and soulful voice who writes intelligent and compassionate songs and puts them over with heartfelt conviction.\u201d\nBarry Cleveland, Guitar Player Magazine\n\nThere are concerts, and then there are rare musical gatherings that feel quietly profound. Harry Manx creates the latter. This is music that doesn\u2019t rush, doesn\u2019t shout, and doesn\u2019t rely on spectacle \u2014 instead, it invites you to listen deeply, feel fully, and leave changed. Audiences don\u2019t just attend a Harry Manx show; they experience it. These nights linger long after the final note fades, becoming the kind of concert people talk about for years. If you value artistry, atmosphere, and the rare magic that happens when a room truly listens, this is a performance you\u2019ll want to be part of.",

Be prepared to drop into a deep space.\nDoor sales will be available if there is space. Advanced booking is recommended.\n\nBetween the Worlds is an evening Sound Journey shaped by over thirty years of deep ceremonial and immersive sound practice. Blending primal rhythm, atmospheric voice, deep didgeridoo, and field recordings, the journey unfolds organically \u2014 shifting from dynamic, embodied energy into vast, cinematic stillness.\n\nThis is not passive listening.\nIt is an experience to be entered.\n\nAs sound layers, dissolve, and reform, participants are guided into a liminal space where time softens and inner landscapes awaken. The journey becomes a passage \u2014 one that listeners don\u2019t just hear, but inhabit.\n\nGuided by the myth of the Wandering Forest Spirit, Between the Worlds invites a reconnection with self, with nature, and with something older than language. Ceremonial, immersive, and deeply evocative, this is an evening to slow down, listen deeply, and cross into the unseen.\nIt's like a soundtrack that is crafted to go with your life.\n\nSika's Sound Journeys are truly unique. They are sonic explorations that feature didgeridoos, drums, flutes, voice and orchestral elements. A collection of foraged sounds from objects he has recorded in nature, add even more textures. Many of his sounds are completely unrecognisable and abstract. Immersed in this cocoon of abstract sound, we can find ourselves in the most surprising places in our mind. In this timeless realm, beyond the normal limitations of rational reality, anything is possible.\nAn epic adventure deep inside yourself.\nJourney to worlds within worlds on incredible sound waves.\n\nSika creates a safe space to relax deeply and connect with our inner guidance. This Sound Journey begins and ends with a short guided visualisation.\nThere will be two journeys with an interval. Most people choose to lie down, so bring a yoga mat, pillow and blanket and get really comfortable.\nA journal is also recommended.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Evening Tour\nWould you like to join us and explore the beauty of Karori Cemetery in the evening?\nThis tour is for anyone who would like to see the Cemetery through a different lens, as the landscape settles in from dusk to darkness. On this walk you'll be accompanied by two guides who will take you on a wander through some of the most magical parts of the cemetery, with a story or two of early Wellingtonians along the route. We might even spy a Ruru/Morepork or two! The tour does not have any scary themes. There are points on the tour where we may pause and turn off our torches to enjoy the landscape in the darkness.\nThe tour is of approximately 1.5 hours duration and starts and finishes at the Main Chapel on Rosehaugh Avenue, where there is plenty of easy parking.\nEach attendee needs to bring their own torch that they can comfortably carry for the duration. No head torches please for the comfort of your fellow walkers.\nThe route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. Surefootedness is required. This tour involves approximately 2km of walking, with some slow paced but uphill stints.\nThe tour is not suited for children under the age of 12 or unaccompanied minors. There are no toilets on the route.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee).\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nPlease note:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you on the day 1 hour before the tour starts by email and on our Facebook page.

    "long_description": "Mozart Requiem\nExperience two masterpieces in one exceptional concert as Orpheus Choir Wellington present Christopher Tin\u2019s To Shiver the Sky alongside Mozart\u2019s Requiem. This concert spans five centuries of imagination and purpose, from the earliest dreams of flight to one of the greatest choral masterpieces ever written.\n\nTo Shiver the Sky is an epic choral spectacular from Grammy winning composer Christopher Tin. Drawing on texts from da Vinci, Hildegard von Bingen, Ovid, Jules Verne, Amelia Earhart and John F. Kennedy, it builds a sweeping musical history of human flight from imagined wings to the Moon landing. Born from a record breaking Kickstarter campaign, the work opens with Sogno di Volare, known worldwide as the main theme of Civilization VI, one of the most celebrated strategy games of the decade. Its sound world spans luminous stillness and immense choral climaxes, evoking the exhilaration and peril of human flight.\n\nMozart\u2019s Requiem stands as one of the greatest choral works ever composed. Written in the final months of his life, it sets the sacred Requiem Mass with blazing dramatic power and a depth of feeling that has captivated audiences for more than two centuries. From the fierce energy of the Dies Irae to the aching beauty of the Lacrimosa, the music moves with a haunting power that remains unmatched in the choral repertoire.\n\nTogether these works form an extraordinary musical journey. One celebrates the daring that pushes humanity forward. The other reveals the full dramatic power of the Requiem tradition at its most intense and expressive. Performed by the mighty Orpheus Choir Wellington with Orchestra Wellington, conducted by Brent Stewart and featuring celebrated soprano Emma Pearson, this is a night of immense musical colour and emotional impact.\n\n",

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training.

    "long_description": "John Maus NZ Tour 2026 | WELLINGTON\nBANISHED MUSIC & STRANGE NEWS PRESENT\nJOHN MAUS ~ NEW ZEALAND TOUR 2026\n\nWEDNESDAY 6 MAY - MEOW, WELLINGTON\nTHURSDAY 7 MAY - DOUBLE WHAMMY, AUCKLAND\n\nTickets from Banished Music\n\nThe musical career of John Maus has been riddled with iconic moments. Now, to celebrate the release of his brand new album Later Than You Think, the synth-tastic American songwriter with the unmistakable baritone is headed to New Zealand for two extraordinary shows next May. Brought to you by Banished Music and Strange News, Mr Maus is set to make good on a long-held promise.\n\nIn 2019, after a series of personal tragedies and the stresses of touring his high-intensity show left Maus feeling unable to perform here, he flew home urgently to recover, with shows here cancelled at short notice. Now, with five years of contemplation, retreat and recuperation, and time spent crafting his new record, John Maus is set to make his return.\n\nThroughout his long career, Maus considered himself to have been \u201cconstantly fighting the status quo: the Mickey Mouse Club, Coca-Cola, and all the institutions that reduce culture to its lowest common denominator\u201d. Then, in 2020, he was infamously photographed at the January 6 riots, and was himself promptly \u201ccancelled\u201d.\n\nIn hindsight, he says, he now knows he should have been a lot clearer about his ethos and political beliefs in the wake of it all. \u201cI thought my legacy would speak for itself,\u201d Maus told Stereogum in a recent interview. Stating he was only at the protest to shoot footage for a new documentary film alongside film-maker Alex Moyer, these days he realises he ought to have stated his position a lot more bluntly. \u201cI should have been clearer that I\u2019m absolutely against Trumpism,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as forthright a denunciation as it should have been.\u201d\n\nPowered by \u201cgenuine emotion and radical sincerity\u201d, the new album includes I Hate Antichrist, a song Maus describes as a sort of sequel to Cop Killer, and features a secular Gregorian chant that embraces French philosopher Alain Badiou\u2019s anti-xenophobic sentiment that \u201cAll the people who are here are from here\u201d.\n\nFrom the death of ego and descent into madness, this is a party we\u2019re all invited to.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Day 1 \u2013 May 10, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: Working with Dissociative Parts and Their Voices in Complex Trauma and Dissociative Disorders\nOverview:\nThis seminar focuses on adapting EMDR for individuals with dissociative disorders, using the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) Dolores has developed. It provides strategies for working with dissociative parts and their voices and integrating a trauma-informed approach to inner conflict safely from early treatment stages.\nKey Learning Points:\n\u00b7         Identifying and working with dissociative parts and their voices.\n\u00b7         Understanding the function and purpose of \u201chostile\u201d parts.\n\u00b7         Addressing dissociative phobias through EMDR informed techniques.\n\u00b7         Managing resistance and treatment impasses.\n\u00b7         Structuring work with dissociative parts effectively.\nProgram Description:\nAfter many early cautions about the potential dangers of using EMDR with individuals suffering from dissociative disorders, limited methods have been offered for adapting standard EMDR procedures to this specific population. Based on these early cautions, EMDR is still considered by many clinicians as limited to the treatment of traumatic memories in high-functioning dissociative clients and only after a long preparation phase that depends on other treatment modalities. Confined by this conceptualisation, the use of EMDR is too often limited, and many survivors of severe traumatisation are unable to benefit from EMDR reprocessing and, if at all, only much later in the treatment process.\nDolores Mosquera developed (with AnabelGonzalez, M.D.) the Progressive Approach model for treating complex trauma and dissociation (2012) and the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) (2019, 2025). Using this trauma and AIP-informed models, clinicians can safely utilise a wide range of EMDR interventions (including BLS) from early in the preparatory phase of treatment for patients with dissociative disorders.\nIn this seminar, she will present her current practice of working with clients, including video demonstrations. Mosquera's deft clinical skills and ground-breaking innovative thinking teach a middle ground between \"dissociation blind\" aggressive EMDR interventions and overly cautious delays to the use of EMDR reprocessing.\nMany dissociative clients have difficulty with hostile, critical voices. The internal conflict is sometimes so intense that the person even has difficulty carrying on an ordinary conversation. One factor that affects this conflict is how the patient deals with the voices or parts of the self.\nKey Program Content:\nIdentify the internal system of dissociation and internal voices that are hostile and critical\nHow to read the function and purpose behind the saboteur parts of self\nUsing compassion and understanding to help deal with dissociative phobias within the internal system\nSkills to reduce impasses and resistance that may complicate or reduce the efficacy of the treatment\nSpecific steps to organize the work with hostile parts and voices\n Days 2\u20133 \u2013 May 11\u201312, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: From Fragmentation to Integration: A Master Class in Treating Complex Trauma and Dissociation\nFormat: 2-Day Masterclass: Three Clinical Cases from Start to Finish\nAcross two days, Dolores will present three distinct new cases illustrating varying levels of dissociation \u2014 including one with frequent switching and no initial Adult Self. Each session is interactive, highlighting the therapeutic process from assessment to completion.\nOver two immersive days, this advanced master class offers a rare opportunity to observe and analyse complete therapeutic processes under the expert guidance of Dolores Mosquera.\n\nDolores will present three new and distinct clinical cases, each representing different manifestations of complex trauma and dissociation \u2014 including one client who experiences frequent switching and begins therapy without an integrated adult self.\nParticipants will follow these clients\u2019 journeys from the initial stages of therapy through to treatment completion, gaining deep insight into decision-making, pacing, and the integration of EMDR strategies within complex systems. The format is designed to be highly interactive and reflective, combining video demonstrations, live commentary, and group discussion to deepen understanding of safe, flexible, and attuned clinical practice when working with dissociative clients.\nThis master class is ideal for clinicians seeking to refine their skills, expand their conceptual framework, and enhance clinical confidence when navigating the challenges of trauma-related dissociation.\nAdditional Details\n\u00b7         Eligibility: Must have completed at least Part One of EMDR Basic Training (University of Otago or equivalent).\n\u00b7         Certification: Participants receive a Professional Development Certificate of Attendance.\n\u00b7         Dietary needs: Provided upon registration.\n\u00b7         Parking: Paid on-site parking available.\n\u00b7         Accommodation: Discounted rates at a local Musuem hotel\nTo access your special rates please visit: https://www.independentcollection.com.au/\nSelect your hotel, enter your dates and number of guests and click 'Check Rooms'\nClick \u2018I have a code\u2019\nIn the \u2018Corporate ID\u2019 field enter your booking code: MOSQUERA\nClick \u2018UPDATE\u2019\nYour special rates will appear on the rates screen\nThese rates are available for stays between 07/05/2026 and 15/08/2026 .",

    "long_description": "We\u2019re excited to announce the Connecting Aotearoa Summit 2026\u2014the premier event for shaping New Zealand\u2019s digital future. We launched the expanded event last year to ensure the issues we cover are relevant and pertinent to the nation\u2019s most pressing challenges. In 2026, this is more critical than ever, as the general election looms. We need to make digital connectivity and equity front-and-centre of political debate, economic prosperity, and social wellbeing. The decisions made this year will lock in New Zealand\u2019s digital trajectory for the rest of the decade.\n\nThis year, we are proposing that the Summit tackles the crucial question: \u201cHow do we get everyone connected to the best broadband service that meets their needs to live and thrive in our digital future by 2030?\u201d\n\nThis ambitious national goal demands immediate, coordinated action from policymakers, industry, and community leaders. Join us as we delve into the critical issues surrounding digital connectivity in Aotearoa, directly influencing the next government\u2019s mandate.

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work.

    "long_description": "Meet Getdown Services \u2013 your new favourite band and one of the UK\u2019s hottest word-of-mouth acts! The brilliantly offbeat cult British duo has been turning heads across Britain and Europe with their balls-to-the-walls live shows, tongue-in-cheek wit, razor-sharp lyrics and infectious disco-fuelled grooves, teetering between chaos and genius. And now, after selling out tours across the UK and Europe, they\u2019re bringing their riotous show down under for the first time in May/June 2026 \u2013 with shows in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Wellington, presented by I OH YOU and MG Live. \nTickets go on sale Friday 14 November at 10.00am local time, with MG Live presale commencing Thursday 13 November at 10.00am local time. Sign up for early access to the MG Live presale here.               \n\u201cI reckon we get people asking us to come to Australia probably every day, and everyone in England is moving there, so will be good to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\u201cAlways been one of those places where you\u2019re like, \u2018Fair enough, but I can\u2019t be arsed with that. It looks mad \u2013 there\u2019s snakes and also it takes 40 hours to get there.\u2019 Will be good fun, though! Went to New Zealand to see a mate of ours get married a few years ago and thought it was a lovely country and I really liked those pies they have. It felt quite similar to the UK in a lot of ways, so playing gigs there should be fun!\u201d\nGetdown Services\n\nFor those in the know, Bristol-based duo Josh Law and Ben Sadler \u2013 aka Getdown Services \u2013 are THE must-see new act of the year. And if you don\u2019t know yet, you will soon \u2026 and you\u2019ll wish you got in early! Named as \u201cone to watch\u201d at this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival and dubbed (by the band themselves) \u201cBritain\u2019s Best Band\u201d, their live shows are equal parts smart, sweaty and gloriously unhinged. Their sound is a wild blend of scrappy indie disco, twisted funk and post-punk energy, turning the absurdity of modern Britain into dancefloor gold.        \n \nThe pair met at school in Minehead, Somerset and now make music together at home in Bristol \u2013 churning out what Rolling Stone called \u201cpower disco with unrepentant silliness\u201d with a healthy dose of satire and swagger. Their highly lauded debut album Crisps (Breakfast Records, 2023) showcased their eclectic danceable grooves and biting social commentary, and a mix of sharp, funny social observations wrapped in irresistible, funk-fuelled rhythms. Follow-up EPs Your Medal\u2019s In The Post, Crumbs and latest, Primordial Slot Machine, cemented their cult status, alongside an arsenal of red-hot singles \u2013 including James Bay\u2019s Hat, Dog Dribble, I Got Views and Eat Quiche, Sleep, Repeat.   \n \n \u201cGetdown Services are unrepentantly silly and constantly deliver one of the most joyously deranged live shows \u2013 just one of the best live bands out there!\u201d\n Rolling Stone\n\u201cTheir live show is as daft and as exhilarating as they come. Five stars.\u201d\n Buzz Magazine\n \n \u201cGenuine contenders to being the most exciting and interesting band in the UK right now.\u201d\n CLASH\n\n Getdown Services look set to gobble up the world, one crumb at a time. Whether you\u2019re into danceable chaos, satirical genius or just want to be ahead of the curve, Getdown Services are the band you didn\u2019t know you needed \u2013 until now! Britain\u2019s favourite new band are about to become yours too! \n\nMG LIVE TERMS OF SALE\n\nhttps://mg.live/termsofsale",

    "long_description": "It\u2019s a stage show that covers vast rivers of galaxies in the cosmos, the ecosystems of Earth, and the structure of the human brain. Emergence is the latest show by English physicist, presenter, and personality Professor Brian Cox. He takes to the stage at TSB Arena to contemplate the dazzling complexity of the universe and how it\u2019s built on profoundly simple principles. \nEmergence is also a scientific history of 400 years of human discovery. How did we come to understand so much about the cosmos? Guided by mathematics, curiosity, and an aesthetic sense of symmetry, our species has begun to read the story of the Universe. We\u2019ve started to carry our spacecraft to the edge of the solar system and outwards to the stars. Brian\u2019s engaging style makes these questions come to life. The audience will be left awestruck and thrilled as the show covers vast topics in an accessible way. \nBrian has appeared in many landmark science programs for BBC radio and television over the last 15 years, from the Peabody Award-winning Wonders of the Solar System to the worldwide hit series The Planets. His previous touring show, Horizons, was performed to nearly half a million people across the world.",

    "long_description": "Widely regarded as one of the foremost songwriters of her generation, Suzanne Vega emerged as a leading figure of the folk revival of the early 1980s. Four decades later, she is still writing and singing great songs. In her Wellington show, Suzanne will perform a career-spanning set. See her on stage at St James Theatre performing favourites like Tom\u2019s Diner, Luka, Marlene On The Wall, and plenty more. There\u2019ll also be new songs from her 2025 album, \u2018Flying with Angels\u2019. Joining her on stage will be longtime guitarist, Gerry Leonard, and cellist Stephanie Winters. \nSince the release of her self-titled, critically acclaimed 1985 debut album, Suzanne Vega has played to sold-out concerts across the world. She is a masterful storyteller who, according to one The New York Times critique, \u201cobserves the world with a clinically poetic eye.\u201d Her song lyrics often focus on city life, ordinary people, and real-world subjects. They are notably succinct, understated, and immediately recognisable.",

generation, Suzanne Vega emerged as a leading figure of the folk revival of the early 1980s. Accompanying herself on acoustic guitar, Vega sang what has been called contemporary folk or neo-folk songs of her own creation in Greenwich Village clubs. Since the release of her self-titled, critically acclaimed 1985 debut album, she has given sold-out concerts in many of the world\u2019s best-known venues. Known for performances that convey deep emotion, Vega\u2019s distinctive, \u201cclear, unwavering voice\u201d (Rolling Stone) has been described as \u201ca cool, dry sandpaper-brushed near-whisper\u201d by The Washington Post, with NPR Music noting that she \u201chas been making vital, inventive music\u201d throughout the course of her decades-long career. Bearing the stamp of a masterful storyteller who \u201cobserves the world with a clinically poetic eye\u201d (The New York Times), Vega\u2019s songs have tended to focus on city life, ordinary people and real-world subjects. Notably succinct and understated, her work is immediately recognizable\u2014as utterly distinct and thoughtful as it was when her voice was first heard on the radio over 40 years ago.\n\n\n",

    "long_description": "After three years of closure, the newly renovated and strengthened City Gallery Wellington Te Whare Toi will host the art of Cornelia Parker. The English visual artist is best known for her innovative and contemporary sculpture and installation art. Her large-scale, immersive installations explore themes of destruction and reconstruction, transformation and metamorphosis. Objects are exploded, crushed, and suspended in a world upended and remade anew.\nCurated by independent UK-based curator Andrea Schlieker and City Gallery Wellington\u2019s Senior Curator Aaron Lister, City Gallery Wellington's exhibition will encompass Parker\u2019s long career as an artist. This includes an immersive sound and light installation, \u2018Stolen Thunder\u2019. The work gathers the sounds of approaching storms from around the globe and across time. The exhibition will also showcase her paintings, photos, films, and sculptures.\n\u201cI have always said this is the one exhibition I want to do before I die,\u201d said Charlotte Davy, Ringatohu Toi Director Art and City Gallery Wellington. \u201cI have been following Cornelia Parker\u2019s work for the last twenty years. Bringing her mischievous, dark, and literally explosive work to Wellington is incredible.\u201d \nParker\u2019s work often fills entire rooms and invites the viewer to move through and around the art. Given its physical scale, the blank canvas of the reopened gallery offers the perfect opportunity to host the exhibition. The exhibition will kick off in October 2026, carrying through to March 2027. \nCharlotte notes the exhibition\u2019s themes are also of particular relevance to Wellington. \u201cI hope that the exhibition and our return to Te Ng\u0101kau Civic Square will reflect our city and also help remake it. We are looking forward to opening with a bang.\u201d\nHero image: \u00a9 Cornelia Parker. Courtesy of the artist and Frith Street Gallery, London",

    "long_description": "Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied\nWe aim to provide an accessible and safe environment. Discounts are available for nonwaged members, early birds, volunteers and people buying multiple tickets. Please let us know how we can ensure you're included.",
