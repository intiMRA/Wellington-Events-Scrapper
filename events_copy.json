Its return 34 years later at the 2026 festival is highly anticipated. It has become a landmark piece of New Zealand theatre \u2014 exploring the tension between past and future. Set in the summer of 1965, the play follows Hone, who brings his family from New Zealand\u2019s East Cape to the South Island in search of a better life. As they gather for a beachside birthday h\u0101ng\u012b with their P\u0101keh\u0101 guests, buried secrets and cultural tensions rise to the surface. Far from their  t\u012bpuna , the family must navigate questions of identity, belonging, and survival. \nWaiora Te \u016akaip\u014d was conceived, written and directed by Hone Kouka (Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101ti Raukawa, Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu). The multi-award-winning writer/director has penned 13 plays. Many have been staged in Aotearoa and further afield in Canada, South Africa, New Caledonia, and the UK. Waiora Te \u016akaip\u014d is presented in partnership with the Aotearoa New Zealand Festival of the Arts, Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, Auckland Theatre Company and Tawata Productions.",

    "long_description": "It\u2019s Westerberg High, where popularity is a matter of life and death. Welcome to \u2018Heathers the Musical\u201d. Based on a movie with the same name, the show is a coming-of-age story dealing with love, heartache, defying expectations, and being true to yourself. It originally premiered in Los Angeles in 2013. Since then, the musical has had record-breaking seasons across the globe. It now makes its professional New Zealand debut in 2026, and Wellington is in line to join the school assembly. Described as a high-octane, black comedy rock musical, Heathers is packed with a mix of ballads and showstoppers. The catchy tunes are written by Kevin Murphy (Desperate Housewives) and Laurence O\u2019Keefe (Legally Blonde: The Musical). \nThe 1989 film starred Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. It quickly achieved cult status among audiences. Both the movie and musical follow high school student Veronica Sawyer. Veronica is just another nobody until she\u2019s unexpectedly taken under the wings of the beautiful and cruel Heathers. When mysterious teen rebel J.D. arrives, Veronica learns that it might kill to be a nobody, but it's murder being a somebody. \nThis special production will feature a stellar Australasian cast. So grab your scrunchies, break out the Corn Nuts and wait for the bell to ring.",
    "description": "Based on a movie with the same name, the show is a coming-of-age story dealing with love, heartache, defying expectations, and being true to yourself.\nIt originally premiered in Los Angeles in 2013.\nSince then, the musical has had record-breaking seasons across the globe.\nIt now makes its professional New Zealand debut in 2026, and Wellington is in line to join the school assembly.\nDescribed as a high-octane, black comedy rock musical, Heathers is packed with a mix of ballads and showstoppers."

    "long_description": "\u2018Animals first entered the imagination as messengers and promises,\u2019 John Berger.\nMessengers explores the enduring gaze shared between humans and other animals. The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",
    "description": "Messengers explores the enduring gaze shared between humans and other animals.\nThe exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art.\nIt features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century.\nThe images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden."

    "long_description": "A theatrical double-shot from an iconic playwright and one of our greatest actors.\n\nBruce Mason is perhaps the most significant playwright in Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s theatrical history. Writing with courage and insight, he was a lover of language and a champion of the underdog.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1978, Bruce toured the country, telling uniquely Kiwi stories about emerging identity, cultural cringe and social difference. From church halls to country shearing sheds to the Edinburgh Festival, Bruce would play anywhere, in any circumstance, to any audience.\n\nTo celebrate his extraordinary legacy, Brilliant Adventures and Circa Theatre are collaborating to make two of his greatest solo works resound for a new age.\n\nTwo plays: timeless, universal, distinct. Following their critically acclaimed, sold out run of THINGS I KNOW TO BE TRUE, actor Stephen Lovatt and director Shane Bosher return to Circa for a not-to-be missed theatrical encounter with a master craftsman.\n\nTHE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER\n\u201cI invite you to join me, in a voyage into the past, to that territory of the heart we call childhood.\u201d\n\nBruce Mason\u2019s quintessential Kiwi classic chronicles the friendship between a 12-year-old boy and Firpo, a social outcast who dreams of winning an Olympic medal.\n\nThrough the boy\u2019s eyes we see the wonder of life on a perfect beach, in a perfect 1930s New Zealand, during a perfect summer. It\u2019s a world of magic and transformation, where anything can happen and miracles seem possible.\n\nWhen the boy sets out to help Firpo make his athletic dream a reality, ignoring his father\u2019s rebukes and community ridicule, a battle rages between the eternal optimism of childhood and the harsh pragmatism of adulthood.\n\nGliding effortlessly between flights of poetic fancy and blunt everyday speech, THE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER is New Zealand storytelling at its very best.\n\nNOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES\nAn adolescent boy tries to find his place in an adult-dominated world. A young man retraces an intensely felt boyhood experience of bullying. A playwright in his last days reconciles the value of an artistic life and challenges the idea of New Zealand identity.\n\nComic disasters and confronting your own hubris.

    "long_description": "Working with a live model offers artists an invaluable opportunity to engage directly with the human form. The immediacy of the model\u2019s presence encourages close observation and instinctive decision-making, leading to work that is expressive and real. This hands-on interaction brings a sense of movement and authenticity that\u2019s hard to achieve otherwise.\n\nThe sculpting process typically starts by analyzing the model\u2019s proportions and pose. A wire armature is built to support the structure, and clay is gradually applied to develop the form to a one-third life size, 750mm tall figure. From there, the artist refines the shapes focusing on anatomical accuracy and expressive detail that give the sculpture its final character.\n\nPlease visit the website to know more about the event.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in traditional sculpture and the film industry, Javier is not just a sculptor \u2014 he\u2019s a mentor. Trained in classical techniques, he studied fine arts and took anatomy courses at medical school, developing a rare combination of artistic and anatomical knowledge. He spent over five years at the world-renowned Weta Workshop, contributing to major films and exhibitions, and has worked across materials, scales, and digital technologies.\n\nMaterial is included in the price.\n\nArmature is supplied during the workshop.\n\nYou can buy our tools during the workshop if you like.\n\nTea, Coffee & snacks will be available.\n\nWe do share meals during the workshop.\n\nRefunds are subjected to Terms & conditions",

    "long_description": "Featuring guest Mary Livingston. Mary has been part of our local folk scene since she arrived in Wellington 50 years ago, with forays into classical guitar and various choirs. She has sung with many people...in the early days it was with Dave Nicholson & Mary Hubble. Later, she linked up with Sarah Duckworth & then Robin Brew, the Magpies (acapella 4 part), and Dr Livingston and the Presumptions (band with Don and Jill). Her current singing partner is Sue Chamberlain although Mary and Robin are dusting off their voci for an airing in early 2026! Mary loves to harmonise, and aims to not just come up with something that sounds nice, but that actually tries to enhance the sound of the singer with the tune, - a technique learned from her barbershop-Sweet Adeline sojourn. Today however we are going to hear Mary as a soloist. She will share a range of songs that she likes to sing on her own, and puts the harmony in with her guitar work. Some will be her own songs, and the rest is likely to focus on her take on some Celtic favourites using a DADGAD tuning on her guitar. Some of the songs will be familiar to you, but others less so. She is pretty excited about doing this, as it is rare for her to sing alone.\nIn the second half, we\u2019ll go around the circle and you\u2019re welcome to lead a song or tune if you wish.",

Register to receive a Zoom link: https://dia-nz.zoom.us/.../WN_p6_8lW8vSyOLAnFYTHhOgw...\nA conversation with author Saraid de Silva\nThis year\u2019s Randell Cottage writers-in-residence are Titaua Peu (French writer-in-resident) and Saraid de Silva (New Zealand writer-in-resident).\nJoin Saraid de Silva in conversation with Randell Cottage trustee Francis Cooke. Saraid will also read from her new novel, which promises to be very different from her first and acclaimed book Amma. But how different will it be from Amma\u2019s stories that follow three generations of South Asian women? Saraid says her Untitled Second Novel is a revenge thriller about two best friends in a stolen car, crossing the country to crash a New Year\u2019s Eve party.\nVideo reflections from former writers in residence\nFollowing the conversation, French Cultural Counsellor, Fran\u00e7ois Bockel, will present the latest in the series of short videos of writers-in-residence reflecting on their experience at Randell Cottage. Titaua Peu was the French writer-in-residence earlier this year, and New Zealander Hinemoana Baker was the 2024 New Zealand writer-in-residence.\nThe videos form part of Randell Cottage\u2019s recorded oral history, designed to capture the essence of those writers and their interests while undertaking their fellowships.\nRSVP to let us know you are coming\nLight refreshments will be provided so RSVP before 1 December to info@randellcottage.co.nz.\nRandell Cottage writer\u2019s residency\nWellington\u2019s historic Randell Cottage has been a writers\u2019 residency for New Zealand and French writers since 2001. The Randell Cottage Writers Trust is supported by the New Zealand-France Friendship Fund/Arts Foundation of New Zealand, and the Wellington City Council. It works in close partnership with the Embassy of France.\nAbout the speakers\nSaraid de Silva is a Sri Lankan P\u0101keh\u0101 writer and arts worker based in T\u0101maki Makaurau. She was the co-creator and co-host of Radio New Zealand\u2019s podcast and video series Conversations with My Immigrant Parents and has recently worked as a storyliner, script writer, and script editor on New Zealand television shows. Her first novel, Amma, was released in New Zealand and Australia by Hachette New Zealand in March 2024 and in the UK by Weatherglass Books in April 2024. It was long-listed for the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Literature in the Ockham Awards and the UK Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction.\nTitaua Peu is a Tahitian novelist who stayed in Randell Cottage during the first half of 2025 as the French writer-in-residence. She is working on a new series of books that present a near future marked by a reverse migration, one in which inhabitants of Aotearoa have migrated north to the island of Mangareva in French Polynesia following a great war. The first laureate from French Polynesia, Titaua is considered one of the principal French-speaking voices in the literature of the Pacific, with her writings focusing on Polynesian society, the impact of colonialism and the place of women.",

So, what can we do?\nAbout the ISC Committee for Freedom and Responsibility in Science:\nThe Committee monitors trends related to scientific and academic freedom globally, advises the ISC on official statements and positions, and advocates for the Principles of Freedom and Responsibility in Science. The Committee also engages in major projects at the intersection of science, human rights, and philosophy, such as the ISC\u2019s recent interpretation of The Right to Participate in and Benefit from Science.\nEvent details:\n5:40pm - Doors open\n6:00pm - Panel discussion\n7:15pm - Networking with drinks and canap\u00e9s till 8:15pm",

    "long_description": "A bespoke Draw It Out workshop for Fertility NZ, open to all genders.\nTickets: $34.50pp\nTheme: Strengthen self-care for the holiday season\nStrengthen your inner resources to care for yourself over the holiday season, and meet others going through similar experiences through this online national workshop, using a gentle powerful tool called Interactive Drawing Therapy.\n\nFertilityNZ exists to support New Zealanders experiencing fertility problems, whether facing challenges becoming or staying pregnant. This bespoke workshop shares drawing for wellness, to tap into your inner guidance for support, within a safe space where others may be experiencing similar journeys.\nIncluded in your workshop\nYou will be guided by Lara Phillips, a trained creative facilitator in Interactive Drawing Therapy, through drawing prompts (similar to a guided meditation or journaling) to draw out where you are at and draw out your own inner guidance. No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\nWhat you will need\nAs this is an online workshop, you will need a computer in a comfortable, quiet setting. A hard surface to draw on (like a desk or a board), three to five pages of A3 paper (you can also tape two A4 printing papers together), and any colouring tools of your choice. Crayons are great as they are more child-like so you don't worry about how it looks. Coloured pastels or pencils are also good, or any coloured markers. The key is a range of colours.\n\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz.\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing. It is not intended as therapy nor does it replace counselling, therapy, or any other medical or clinical professional help. Participants are guided to draw out where they are at, whilst drawing out their own inner resources for support and guidance.\nParticipants understand it is their own responsibility to manage their mental and physical health during sessions, to opt in and out of activities as they see fit, and make the facilitator aware if further support is required.",

    "long_description": "A theatrical double-shot from an iconic playwright and one of our greatest actors.\n\nBruce Mason is perhaps the most significant playwright in Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s theatrical history. Writing with courage and insight, he was a lover of language and a champion of the underdog.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1978, Bruce toured the country, telling uniquely Kiwi stories about emerging identity, cultural cringe and social difference. From church halls to country shearing sheds to the Edinburgh Festival, Bruce would play anywhere, in any circumstance, to any audience.\n\nTo celebrate his extraordinary legacy, Brilliant Adventures and Circa Theatre are collaborating to make two of his greatest solo works resound for a new age.\n\nTwo plays: timeless, universal, distinct. Following their critically acclaimed, sold out run of THINGS I KNOW TO BE TRUE, actor Stephen Lovatt and director Shane Bosher return to Circa for a not-to-be missed theatrical encounter with a master craftsman.\n\n\nTHE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER\n\u201cI invite you to join me, in a voyage into the past, to that territory of the heart we call childhood.\u201d\n\nBruce Mason\u2019s quintessential Kiwi classic chronicles the friendship between a 12-year-old boy and Firpo, a social outcast who dreams of winning an Olympic medal.\n\nThrough the boy\u2019s eyes we see the wonder of life on a perfect beach, in a perfect 1930s New Zealand, during a perfect summer. It\u2019s a world of magic and transformation, where anything can happen and miracles seem possible.\n\nWhen the boy sets out to help Firpo make his athletic dream a reality, ignoring his father\u2019s rebukes and community ridicule, a battle rages between the eternal optimism of childhood and the harsh pragmatism of adulthood.\n\nGliding effortlessly between flights of poetic fancy and blunt everyday speech, THE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER is New Zealand storytelling at its very best.\n\n\nNOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES\nAn adolescent boy tries to find his place in an adult-dominated world. A young man retraces an intensely felt boyhood experience of bullying. A playwright in his last days reconciles the value of an artistic life and challenges the idea of New Zealand identity.\n\nComic disasters and confronting your own hubris. NOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES is a richly autobiographical search for self-expression. Profound and true, it is a set of variations about over-reaching, cheekily confronting our very own Tall Poppy Syndrome.\n\nCelebrating Bruce Mason\nDirected by Shane Bosher\nPerformed by Stephen Lovatt\n\nPlease note The End of the Golden Weather and Not Christmas, but Guy Fawkes tickets need to be purchases separately, see the Circa Theatre website for full dates and ticket details.",

This hands-on interaction brings a sense of movement and authenticity that\u2019s hard to achieve otherwise.\n\nThe sculpting process typically starts by analyzing the model\u2019s proportions and pose. A wire armature is built to support the structure and clay is gradually applied to develop the form to a one-third life size 750mm tall figure. From there the artist refines the shapes focusing on anatomical accuracy and expressive detail that give the sculpture its final character.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in traditional sculpture and the film industry Javier is not just a sculptor \u2014 he\u2019s a mentor. Trained in classical techniques he studied fine arts and took anatomy courses at medical school developing a rare combination of artistic and anatomical knowledge. He spent over five years at the world-renowned Weta Workshop contributing to major films and exhibitions and has worked across materials scales and digital technologies.\n\nMaterial is included in the price.\nArmature is supplied during the workshop.\nYou can buy our tools during the workshop if you like.\nTea\n\nAlso check out other Workshops in Lower Hutt, Arts events in Lower Hutt, Fine Arts events in Lower Hutt.",

This approach encourages you to meet yourself as you are \u2014 to listen to the intelligence of your body's own rhythms and sense how they echo the wider rhythms of the earth. Through this listening, we enter a living, evolving conversation about well-being and what it can look like in today\u2019s world.\n\nHow is your heart?

She deeply values the insight, liberation, inner and collective resources somatic movement practices can offer. Abbie has also completed a 50-hour training exploring how yoga can support trauma awareness, mental health, and body image.

    "long_description": "Twentysix is pleased to present the last show of the year by \u014ctautahi based artist couple Hugo Van Dorsser and Catarina Correia Arnhold. With a sense of play and punchy, evocative colour at the centre - \u2018Thoughts That Make Us Think\u2019 is a meeting of material worlds. Gallery walls are met with a bold expression of life and an unapologetic exploration into how the artists\u2019 materials can perform on behalf of their intuition and imagination. At times looking back in nostalgia, while others look inward toward the spirit and self.\nVan Dorsser works, predominately in oil paint, in thick strokes. Drawn with a confident hand in building block shapes, he references childhood with toy cars and little houses, as well as employing the symbol of the butterfly to explore hope and change - all collaged together with a blurry face hidden at the side. They are dreamlike, the surreal spelt out with each canvas, Van Dorsser piecing together - and thus inviting his viewers - into an emotional landscape of shared nostalgia.\nCorreia Arnhold\u2019s gritty clay shapes are a visualisation of emotion - created quickly, roughly - following her at the height of feeling. Spanning both three dimensional and wall bound, each piece is an exploration of the artist\u2019s central symbols of the subconscious, religion and memory. Rough clay is layered in glossy, bright pastel glazes, set against deep, matte finishes - working in juxtaposition to expose conflicting narratives. Her use of the lone rider, priests, a crowd and holy figures throughout, asks of reality versus imagination, sentimentality versus fantasy, day to day versus the preternatural. An ongoing balance between a welcomed freedom of material and a language of myth, memory, and personal narrative.\nThe two artists sidestep together into a landscape of play. Testing boundary lines between material and reality, between fantasy and a blurred memory - all lit in vivid colour. \u2018Thoughts That Make Us Think\u2019 asks us to pace along after them, indulged in their two worlds.\nJoin us for the opening celebration on Friday, 28 November at 6pm \u2013 both artists will be present.\nThe exhibition runs from 29 November \u2013 20 December 2025 at Twentysix Gallery.\nOpening Hours:\nThursday 12pm - 6pm\nFriday 12pm - 6pm\nSaturday 10am - 4pm\nOr by appointment ",

Despite the repeated failure of standard policy processes, citizens assemblies have only recently made it to New Zealand. Register for this event to find out more about the Porirua Assembly on Climate and its innovations. \nPorirua is known for community-led innovations in governance and delivery, and the Porirua Assembly on Climate continued this tradition by being:\nthe first climate assembly in New Zealand,  \nthe first assembly co-designed and organised by an iwi authority and a community group, \nthe first assembly process designed to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi by using a tricameral design,  \nthe first New Zealand assembly to include children and young people, and \nby creating a new local governance body - the Porirua Community Leaders Forum - that sponsored the Assembly, holds its recommendations and can instigate ongoing community dialogue on local issues. \nPanellists will share learning on the Porirua Assembly\u2019s innovations, talk about why the standard citizens assembly model was modified, dig into what enabled so many firsts and how these worked out in practice. They will reflect on this legacy and possible future impacts. Might these democratic innovations strengthen local democracy elsewhere in Aotearoa New Zealand? \nAbout the Host and Speakers\nJodi Watene is a Systems Change Lead at Te R\u016bnanga o Toa Rangatira Incorporated, was the project manager for the Porirua Assembly and is helping to establish a New Zealand Community of Practice on Indigenous Citizens\u2019 Assemblies.\nMakerita Makapelu is a Team Leader for Wesley Community Action in Porirua with a background in performing arts and youth work. She specialises in community-led development and grassroots systems change, and was one of the Porirua Assembly facilitators.  \nCally O'Neill was a participatory designer of community spaces until 2019 when she shifted her focus towards advocating for Te Tiriti-based deliberative democracy to address the climate and other contemporary crises. She is a founding member of Te Reo O Ng\u0101 T\u0101ngata/The People Speak and was one of the Porirua Assembly facilitators. \nFuture Unity, a youth climate group formed during the Assembly process will be represented by Orini Rokx-Taratu and Santino Morehu, who were participants in the Assembly\u2019s youth and community streams.  \nEmily Beausoleil is an Associate Professor at Te Herenga Waka - Victoria University of Wellington. Her research as a political theorist centres on the dynamics, conditions and challenges of democratic engagement in diverse societies. She is conducting an independent evaluation of the Porirua Assembly process.",

It\u2019s also just a different & cool way of meeting new people by getting a bit out of your comfort zone and skipping the small talk!\nJoin us for games, talks, and connections with friends you haven\u2019t met yet. Join if you get annoyed after being asked what you do, where you are from, and how long you have been in Wellington every single time you meet someone. If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll never have to speak in public if you don\u2019t want to!\n\nHOW TO JOIN?\nTake 2 minutes to fill out our form\n\nhttps://luma.com/ftstwellington10\nOur events are limited to 30 handpicked guests to ensure a cozy atmosphere. We prioritize a balance in gender and cultural diversity, making each gathering a unique blend of perspectives! If you're invited you'll receive an invite with a special link via our ticketing platform Luma\n\nHOW MUCH IS IT?\nThe cost to attend is NZD 23 (early llama) - NZD 25 (general llama) and includes the following:\n3 hours of facilitated and curated activities\nLight snacks to keep the energy going (only if outdoors)\nA space to meet new people in the least boring way possible\nSupporting our mission to slowly eliminate small talk around the world\nAlso includes those pesky ticket fees!\n\nWHERE IS IT?\nWe host our events in awesome cafes, rooftops, and bars across the city.

Get to the heart of the matter, dive straight into what really counts!\u201d - Matthias\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of activity humanity needs every weekend. Thank you for all.\u201d - Sonya\n\n\u201cF*ck the Small Talk changes the narrative from \"Where are you from?\" to \"When was the last time you laughed uncontrollably?\" and I think that's beautiful.\u201d - Monika\n\n\u201cI loved F*ck the small talk, I was a little bit nervous at first but they are pros at making you feel comfortable with the rest of the group, the activities are really fun and I enjoyed every second (consider that the one who's saying this is very, very shy). Give it a try!\u201d - Brenda\n\n\"it\u2019s a wonderful experience, it\u2019s like being a kid again, when you were at the park, playing with other kids, and just decided you were going to be best friends for the next hours. Maybe you\u2019ll never see those kids again. But that hour was amazing because you both opened up and trusted each other.\" - Sara\n\n\u201cLively, interesting, introspective, completely open and no judgement. Everyone that joined was ready for great conversation and helped with different perspectives. So much fun! I can't wait for the next one! \u201c - Yaz\n\nCheck out our 100+ Google reviews: https://goo.gl/maps/TpZy77bfPFkGoikn7\n\nFAQ\n\u2022 Can I come alone?\nOf course, in fact, we encourage it! 99% of people do.\n\n\u2022 I signed up but never got an invite. Why?\nWe usually get a high volume of sign-ups yet we like to keep it cozy & only about 30 people. We believe this is a good number to ensure an awesome experience! Please try again next time if do not receive an invite - no hard feelings\n\n\u2022 Why do you charge?\nWe value our time and put a lot of love, planning, and effort into creating & designing these experiences.\nThis is our project/business and what we give to the world and we think everything should be a fair exchange! However, money should never be the reason for people not to attend. If you can\u2019t afford it simply get in touch with us\n\n\u2022 I'm digging this! Can I get involved somehow?\nSure thing, send us a message!\n\n\u2022 Can I bring my cute dog/llama?\nIt depends on where the event is! Message us to make sure. But it's always a YES in our hearts.\n\n\u2022 Can I get a refund if I can't make it?\nUnfortunately, we do not offer refunds or ticket transfers to another event date if you cannot attend with a notice of less than 5 days notice. BUTTTT feel free to pass on your ticket to a friend, provided they also sign up for the form\n--\n\n\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude68, \ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude59.\n* Only 30 spots available\n* Location is only revealed to ticket holders!\n* Age guide, 22-40 years old (only a reference, never a limit\n)\n\nThis event is a no-phone experience.

    "long_description": "Join us to hear Dr Maia Nuku (Ng\u0101i Tai) deliver the annual Gordon H Brown Lecture, hosted in collaboration with Victoria University and the Adam Art Gallery. Nuku is the Evelyn A. J. Hall and John A. Friede Curator for Oceanic Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\nWhat is the role and relevancy of museums in the 21st century? Are they living, expansive archives of Indigenous knowledge? Or outdated relics of colonial pasts.\nThe complete overhaul and construction of new galleries for the Arts of Oceania at The Metropolitan Museum in New York gave curator Maia Nuku a unique opportunity to reframe the galleries conceptually; to emphasize connectivity in the context of global and local histories; and elevate the equally critical arts of storytelling, oratory, and performance alongside Oceania\u2019s dynamic visual arts. Curator Maia Nuku shares insights into the 10-year project that has culminated in a suite of galleries that offer international visitors perspectives on art that reach deep into Oceania\u2019s past while also acknowledging ongoing manifestations of its agency in the present.\nBorn in London of English and M\u0101ori (Ngai Tai) descent, Dr. Maia Nuku is Curator for the Arts of Oceania at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She completed two post-doctoral fellowships at the University of Cambridge (2008-2014) as part of an international research team exploring Oceanic art collections in European museums in France, Spain, the Netherlands and Russia. Researching the collections alongside Pacific artists and practitioners, the work was collaborative and sought to create access to these collections both in the physical and digital domains. During her time at the Met, Maia has evolved a curatorial approach that centers indigenous Pacific perspectives, grounding the presentation of visual arts in the unique conceptual and cosmological connections that make art from Oceania so compelling. In 2023, her exhibition The Shape of Time: Art and Ancestors of Oceania travelled to Museum of Art in Pudong, Shanghai (June 1 - Aug 20, 2023) and National Museum of Qatar (Oct 23, 2023 - Jan 15, 2024).  For the past eight years, Maia has overseen a major reinstallation of the Oceania galleries at the Metropolitan Museum which showcases the creativity of indigenous Pacific artists from the 18th century to the present through the compelling lenses of global history, indigenous storytelling, and Pacific oratory and performance.",

Are they living, expansive archives of Indigenous knowledge? Or outdated relics of colonial pasts.\nThe complete overhaul and construction of new galleries for the Arts of Oceania at The Metropolitan Museum in New York gave curator Maia Nuku a unique opportunity to reframe the galleries conceptually; to emphasize connectivity in the context of global and local histories; and elevate the equally critical arts of storytelling, oratory, and performance alongside Oceania\u2019s dynamic visual arts. Curator Maia Nuku shares insights into the 10-year project that has culminated in a suite of galleries that offer international visitors perspectives on art that reach deep into Oceania\u2019s past while also acknowledging ongoing manifestations of its agency in the present.

Since then, he has pursued a successful solo career, releasing a series of well-received albums. His 2020 album, Getting Sober for the End of the World, was widely praised for its sharp social commentary and musical craftsmanship, earning airplay and accolades both locally and internationally.

This is an excellent opportunity to treat yourself to some creative fun on Friday nights!\n\nIn weeks one and two you'll learn how to work with jeweller's hard wax to create beautiful textures in metal that can be used to create amazing rings or objects. Your waxes will be sent away for casting in the metal of your choice.\n\nThen there will be a week's break before the third session, to allow time for everyone's waxes to be cast. The third session covers how to trim, clean and finish your casts, turning them into original jewellery ready to wear!\n\nMore advanced students can use these sessions to complete projects in a class setting.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are all your different types of waxes, sandpaper and courier costs.\n\nNot included are the casting and metal costs which vary from student to student depending on what sized ring they want to make and the type of metal you choose.

    "long_description": "Please remember this is a ZERO WASTE and *NO ALCOHOL* community gathering.\nKia ora!\nFull Moon Drumming Wellington is a registered public event with the Wellington City Council. We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Driftwood from nearby south coast beaches is often abundant, feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page. The less cars driving the better.\nFeel free to share the event page and send an event invite to whomever you feel would be interested, not everyone sees the notifications and advertising ",

    "long_description": "What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

You'll experience the opportunity to restore, recalibrate and realign your soul to its highest timeline for 2026 and beyond. This intimate event will have very limited capacity, to ensure a deep inward experience for all.\n\nWe will share in a sacred water ceremony with coherent water that has been structured, charged and infused with frequency- ready to be programmed with your intentions to release and shift into the new.\n\nNext, we will connect with a Triple Cone Orgonite meditation, further amplifying the Euphoria to all, energising your intentions and clearing the way for the shifts to come.\n\nWith awareness of breath and the rhythmic handpan drumming, you will gently be guided inward to begin your journey and actualize your intentions.\n\nThe heartbeat of the journey is a very special 30 year old handmade Buffalo drum from Utah, USA. Yana is the beat we move and breathe to, the guide and the gateway, the beat of Mother Earth. Allow her depth and resonance to take you to places you\u2019ve forgotten and re-introduce to you the primal heartbeat of humanity, of your humanity.\n\nAn intentional weaving of a multitude of instruments, beats and frequencies that will take you to places deep within yourself: an opportunity to explore, feel and release what no longer serves you. As we move into higher frequencies of consciousness as a collective, we are being called to clear the old- expectations, stories, beliefs, programs, conditioning and paradigms. You bring the intention and Yana will guide you into surrender, allowing all that does not serve your highest timeline to fall away.\n\nAnd as you gently re-emerge into the waking state, you'll experience the quiet and space to recalibrate and sink into the tenderness of renewal.\n\nThis journey is a sacred experience, designed to guide you through your own process. As such, this will mainly be a silent event (not social).\nContribution $55\nNameste\n\nNamaste\n\n",

You'll experience the opportunity to restore, recalibrate and realign your soul to its highest timeline for 2026 and beyond. This intimate event will have very limited capacity, to ensure a deep inward experience for all.\nWe will share in a sacred water ceremony with coherent water that has been structured, charged and infused with frequency- ready to be programmed with your intentions to release and shift into the new.\nNext, we will connect with a Triple Cone Orgonite meditation, further amplifying the Euphoria to all, energising your intentions and clearing the way for the shifts to come.\nWith awareness of breath and the rhythmic handpan drumming, you will gently be guided inward to begin your journey and actualize your intentions.\nThe heartbeat of the journey is a very special 30 year old handmade Buffalo drum from Utah, USA. Yana is the beat we move and breathe to, the guide and the gateway, the beat of Mother Earth. Allow her depth and resonance to take you to places you\u2019ve forgotten and re-introduce to you the primal heartbeat of humanity, of your humanity. \nAn intentional weaving of a multitude of instruments, beats and frequencies that will take you to places deep within yourself: an opportunity to explore, feel and release what no longer serves you. As we move into higher frequencies of consciousness as a collective, we are being called to clear the old- expectations, stories, beliefs, programs, conditioning and paradigms. You bring the intention and Yana will guide you into surrender, allowing all that does not serve your highest timeline to fall away.\nAnd as you gently re-emerge into the waking state, you'll experience the quiet and space to recalibrate and sink into the tenderness of renewal.\nThis journey is a sacred experience, designed to guide you through your own process. As such, this will mainly be a silent event (not social). We ask that you respect others by refraining from socializing in the space.\nNamaste\nMystic Creative",

His well-honed ability to work a dance floor and his eclecticism are what has got him there. A decade or so after breaking out, he\u2019s now matured as a DJ and producer to the point where he has the confidence to lead his crowd wherever he wants and they always go with him wherever he plays. Synonymous with long sets and an innate ability to read a crowd, his immediate early impact led to high-profile gigs as soon as he arrived on the scene.\nHe is now perfectly at home at places like fabric, Circoloco, WHP, Glasgow's very own Sub Club and many more alongside a who's who of the underground scene. It's almost impossible to define his sound, switching between heavy, swing-fuelled house, fizzing techno tools and twitchy minimal wig-outs. Essentially, what you get from Jasper James are stripped-back solid grooves that make people move. Releasing on labels ranging from Optimo Trax and ESP Institute through to No Art, as well as his own Mitchell Street Records imprint, the quality remains high because releases only come when James truly connects with them. With a flurry of new music currently in the pipeline, Jasper James remains as vital a presence in the underground as ever.\nJasper is more certainly one of the finest selectors in the world.\nMake an evening of it and come for a late afternoon drink or meal - and get into the groove when the beats start.\nEarly doors, early night.\nSaturday 6 December - 7pm to 1am\nLock in the date for your dose of sonic essence.\nHouse through to techno and beyond.",

And good luck with that.\n\nBuddha is a b-i-g fan of the Slow Down Movement.\n\nWhen we slow down in meditation, for example, we give ourselves the chance to absorb.\nWhen we slow down in daily life, we give ourselves the chance to respond to people, events, thoughts, etc. with wisdom and empathy.\nWe regain crucial control over our own mind and our own actions. If you feel that your world is slipping out of your control, please join us for some teachings on Buddha\u2019s advice for how to shift into a lower gear, in life and in meditation.\n\nEveryone is welcome.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nThese classes are based on Buddha\u2019s teachings on the mind, but you do not need to be a Buddhist to attend, or to benefit from them. There is no physical exercise involved and you can choose to sit either in a chair or on a cushion. These classes are suitable for all levels of experience.\n\nRegistration starts at 9:30am. This course includes a vegan, wheat-free morning tea (we cannot guarantee gluten-free).\n\n",

Because I work and hold space within a high vibrational field, everyone present is able to access, attune to, and receive these elevated frequencies too - opening a gateway to higher states of awareness and multidimensional reconnection.\nThis is a multi-layered energetic journey that will support your soul\u2019s evolution and empower you with tools to continue accessing these frequencies whenever you need them.\n\nIn Ancient Atlantean Times...\nHealing was simple.\nPeople would sit before sacred, light-infused paintings, allowing frequency, sound, and intention to restore balance and harmony.\nI\u2019m bringing this ancient practice back.\n\nJoin me for a group Healing Session in Wellington \u2022 a beautiful multidimensional experience for deep new-code absorption, renewal, and alignment. You\u2019ll sit in sacred space before my Pleiadian Portal Painting, surrounded by gentle frequency music, sipping ceremonial Kakao, and immersed in high-vibrational energy.\nEach person will receive a clearing and then be guided through a powerful meditation and activation, with time to journal and share afterwards.\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s Included in This Sacred Attunement Journey\n\u2022 Individual Galactic Clearing\nWe begin by preparing your field for higher frequencies. Each participant will receive a personal energy clearing to release stagnant or lower vibrations, supported by channeled light language to open you to deeper transformation.\n\n\u2022 Heart-Opening Kacao Ceremony\nOnce the clearing is complete, we\u2019ll share a gentle ceremonial Kacao experience to expand the heart, deepen receptivity, and create a sacred container for Pleiadian frequencies to flow through.\n\n\u201cRaise Your Vibration\u201d Pleiadian Wisdom Talk\nI\u2019ll share insights into who the Pleiadians are, their role in humanity\u2019s awakening, and how their joyous, supportive energy can help you in everyday life. You\u2019ll also receive simple, powerful tools to help you reconnect with this frequency long after our circle.\n\n\u2022 Guided Meditation & Activation\nWe journey through a deeply guided meditation supported by my Pleiadian Encoded Artwork and light language transmissions. This works on a soul level to activate deeper layers of your light body, anchor wisdom, and align you with higher frequencies. The energetic transmission continues to integrate long after the session.\n\n\u2022 Personal Angelic Attunement & Integration\nTo complete our journey, each participant will receive a personal ANGELIC attunement to anchor the frequencies received and integrate them into their unique energetic system, supporting lasting transformation and soul alignment.\n\n\u2022 Why This Circle is Unique\nThis is an intimate, boutique-style event limited to just 10 participants to ensure a deeply personal and supportive experience for everyone. Smaller groups allow me to focus the energy on each individual, maximising the depth and potency of the transformation you\u2019ll receive.\nYou will leave feeling uplifted, attuned, and supported \u2014 and with the ability to reconnect with these higher frequencies whenever you need.\nTo help extend and nurture the energy beyond the circle, supportive tools will be available and to order - including aura sprays, light-encoded scarves, and art prints, so you can continue to connect with and access the Pleiadian frequencies in your own space.\n\nEvent Details\nDate: Sunday, 7 December 2025\nLocation: Whitby, Wellington (address supplied upon booking)\nTime: 4:00 PM \u2013 6:00 PM\nExchange: NZ$65\nMaximum Group: 10 participants only \u2014 early booking is recommended.\n\n",

Told through a series of fragments that range from raw and troubled to delightful and hilarious, this remarkable book responds to the unexpected shocks and discoveries of becoming a mother, drawing on excerpts from family letters and secretive medical records, and advice contained in Truby King\u2019s 1913 tract, Feeding and Care of Baby. Resonant with, yet distinct from, the works of writers like Maggie Nelson, Kate Zambreno, Olga Ravn and Chris Kraus, Hiding Places is an inspiring read for anyone interested in the dangerous yet fruitful zones where life and art overlap.\n\nSunday 7 December 2025\n5:00pm\u20136:00pm\nUnity Books Wellington\n57 Willis Street, Wellington Central\nAll welcome!\n\n\n",

He combines these powerful teachings with modern, effective tools as a certified practitioner in applied hypnotherapy, along with the knowledge he gained through his diploma in psychology and counseling.\n\n6.15pm Tuesday 9th December\n\nEnd the session on a high note with a delicious plant-based dinner, dessert, and good conversation.",

Just show up as you are, with no pressure to speak or share.\nOpen group: new faces are welcome\nFlexible: book to come when it suits you. Each Tuesday is a new event. Most will try for fortnightly.\nSmall groups: 8 men + 2 experienced hosts\nInclusive: all ages, backgrounds and identities (18+)\nIt's about connection and showing up, instead of going it alone. It makes time for meeting our various challenges, while learning and growing us into better friends, partners, dads, sons and humans. \nIt isn\u2019t a boys or bros club, therapy or a self-help seminar, religious or new-age. No fixing, preaching, or pressure. It\u2019s not a crisis service or a substitute for professional care. The sign-up form explains this in more detail.\nYou can expect to:\nPractice listening and learn communication skills for life\nDiscover greater integrity and self-accountability\nBe supported in building your emotional intelligence\nBecome a part of a hearty and diverse community\nHave a good time - it\u2019s often uplifting and inspiring.\nJoseph and your team of hosts have all been in regular men's groups for many years. The group sometimes offers simple and proven inquiries that draw on NVC, MBSR, active listening, gratitude and more.",

    "long_description": "Join us for the inaugural Young Photographer Award, the first event of its kind in New Zealand celebrating young creative talent aged 7 to 18.\n\nOver the past year we have run more than 80 workshops and inspired over 180 kids to try photography. Many arrived with no previous experience and discovered a new way to express themselves. Some even chose photography as their future career. Our workshops are fully inclusive and also support kids who may need extra learning help, giving them a space to slow down, focus and build confidence through creativity.\n\nHeld in Lower Hutt, Wellington, this evening is all about creativity, wonder and community. Students who took part in our photography workshops will have their work displayed at the event, and our nominated young photographers will receive special awards recognising their talent, effort and unique way of seeing the world.\n\nA creative evening for everyone\nThe event will be inspiring not only for young photographers but also for adults, families and anyone who enjoys creativity and photography. It is a great chance to support young talent, enjoy beautiful images and be part of a welcoming creative community.\n\nBring your friends and wh\u0101nau. The more support we show our young photographers, the more their creativity shines and inspires others.\n\nWe are excited to welcome four inspiring speakers:\n\nEtanah Lalau Talapa\n\nThe evening will open with a talk by Etanah Lalau Talapa, a multi-disciplinary artist and curator of Afega and Sa\u2019anapu heritage from Samoa. Etanah holds a Bachelor of Design in Spatial Design from the College of Creative Arts at Massey University. Her work spans public installations, digital art, mixed media and photography. She often explores themes of motherhood, family lineage and the lived experiences of the Pacific diaspora in Aotearoa. Her practice focuses on discovering new visual languages that connect traditional and contemporary creative forms while honouring her Samoan cultural heritage.\n\n\nChris McKeown\n\nChris is a Wellington photographer whose work has been nominated for multiple awards and published widely. His work appears in calendars, prints, magazines, exhibitions, and large murals at Wellington Hospital, and he shoots the night sky, landscapes, and performance events. By day he is an executive, leadership mentor, and public speaker, with a passionate belief in compassionate leadership. Chris will share his journey to realising that slowing down and looking up can shift how we feel, think, and see the world and each other.\n\n\nMiro Kennett\n\nMiro Kennett (she/her) is a teen underwater photographer from Aotearoa NZ. Her work centres on capturing the underwater world and our connection to it. She spends most of her time photographing in Te Whanganui a Tara at Taputeranga Marine Reserve, exploring the coast and noticing how the ocean shifts each day. She has also captured images in the Poor Knights and Fiji. Through her photography she aims to share the beauty and life beneath the surface and inspire others to care for our marine environments.\n\n\nGareth Davies\n\nOriginally from Gloucester in the UK, Gareth has been passionate about photography since borrowing his grandparents\u2019 Kodak film camera as a kid. He trained as a darkroom tech and photographer in the Royal Air Force, later becoming a photography instructor. After moving to Aotearoa, he went on to spend many years teaching forensic photography with NZ Police. Gareth now spends his spare time exploring Kapiti\u2019s beaches and marine reserves, sharing his love of photography with anyone keen to learn.",

Her journey is rooted in self-growth and connection, with a strong focus on nourishing the body as an essential part of this.\n\nMeet Alex, your sound healer\nAlex is a sound healing practitioner devoted to nurturing healing in both mind and body. She believes that sound vibration holds the power to expand consciousness and restore harmony and balance in our lives. Her journey into sound healing began with the realization of how deeply sound vibration was affecting her psyche\u2014making her more mindful of the music she listens to and the intention it carries. Along the way, she has drawn inspiration from artists such as Deva Premal, The Flying Mystics, Stevin McNamara, and the Bhakti Lounge Kirtan. Their music has profoundly influenced her own sound healing practice, inspiring her to explore sound as a tool for transformation, connection, and inner peace.",

Return could therefore either be 1:30 or 2:30 with the latest return to Titahi Bay being 3pm.\n\nWe've made this event later than the normal SKISL so that it's easier for folks to drive down from Palmerston North, and also because it is a lunch event.\n\nThe lawn on Mana is really nice, sheltered and pleasant and there are also good walks. Mana is of course a sanctuary so you must check your boats for any wildlife especially ants that may have gotten in past the hatches. Also we cannot have any fires\n\nPlan B: If weather nukes Mana, we'll try for Green Point or Onehunga Bay in Whitireia Park by driving there.\n\nPlan C: We will postpone to 21 December\n\nAlso check out other Workshops in Porirua.",

    "long_description": "What does it feel like to exist in a queer body? This workshop aims to help sapphic women and gender minorities find joy, freedom, and connection through somatic exercises that help you embody and embrace your queerness. You will leave feeling confident in your ability to take up space, tapped into your self-expression, and connected to the experiences of your sapphic community.\nHere\u2019s a rundown of what to expect:\n- Opening Exercise: Guided somatic movements to loosen up your body\n- Community Connection: Rotating conversations with other participants about queer embodiment\n- Yoga Flow: Creative 30 minute class to explore presence and connect to your self-expression\n- Guided Meditation: A relaxing combination of breathwork and visualisation to cultivate safety in your body\n- Closing Connection: Gentle and grounding partner stretches (optional) and group reflections\nNo prior experience with yoga or somatic exercises necessary! All you need to attend is an open attitude, a desire to connect with your body, and a willingness to share your experience with other sapphics. Yoga mats and all other props will be provided. While this workshop dives into your embodied expression of sapphic identity/sexuality, none of the content is sexual in nature and the small amount of physical touch with other participants is completely optional.\nThe workshop is facilitated by Megan Edwards, creator of Golden Hour Gigs and a 500CYT trauma-informed yoga teacher. This event is intended specifically for queer women and gender minorities. No TERFS no SWERFS.\nContent consideration: Because this workshop focuses on finding joy/pleasure/freedom in your body, it might not be suited for anyone experiencing intense dysphoria. With that said, you are welcome to explore discomfort and work on integrating challenging feelings. Megan is trained in movement techniques to lead you away from anything too activating and help you find safety in your body.\nAccessibility: Awhi Yoga Studios has an elevator and is wheelchair accessible. There are plenty of gender neutral bathrooms and cosy spaces to rest if you need a break from the workshop at any time. If you want to attend but are concerned about the level of movement required, please email the organiser with any mobility questions at goldenhourgigz@gmail.com ",

This year we're part of the Wellington Enduro Series and this is a race you do not want to miss!\n\nEveryone is welcome whether it\u2019s your first Enduro or you are riding to be the MMBC Club Champ (just remember \u2013 only MMBC members who ride the hard course will be in the running for the Club Enduro Champ title).\n\nNot sure how an Enduro works or a bit tentative to enter a race? We\u2019ve got you covered. Join the gang at the back of the pack and take all the time you need. A tail-end Charlie will sweep down and make sure no one overtakes you.\n\nWant to participate as a Minder Rider for your child on the course? That\u2019s cool. There is no cost to do that. Just choose \u201cminder rider\u201d when you enter. This option is only available for the Intermediate course.\n\nThe Intermediate course will have four stages of downhill fun. Be prepared for mostly Grade 3. There may be a Grade 4 thrown in but everything is rollable. Ready to send it on harder stuff? Then the Hard course is for you. It will have five stages of Grade 3, 4, 5 and 6 trails. It will be hard.\n\nYou can change your course choice on race day!

Saturday 13th of December, the band will take the stage at Auckland\u2019s glorious Hollywood Avondale for an all-ages show, playing Meow in Wellington on Sunday 14th December.\n\nAfter bursting onto the scene with two incredible albums in a single year - the brilliant Tracey Denim and the noisy niceness of The Twits - bar italia spent the next while earning a reputation as one of the best live bands in the game, including a sold out and sweaty show at Auckland\u2019s Neck of the Woods. Since then, the band have been plotting their next move in world domination, dropping fan favourite single Cowbella in June, and this week lifting the lid on Some Like It Hot with accompanying tune Fundraiser - with a video featuring Matt \u201cSuper Hans\u201d King.\n\nThe London based band, built around the core of Nina Cristante, Jezmi Tarik Fehmi and Sam Fenton, may have looked to be hiding out this year while cooking up this new batch of tunes, but in reality they\u2019ve been anything but dormant. Cristante teamed up with Yves Tumor for a dangerously good duet on We Don\u2019t Count, while Jezmi and Sam dropped another full-length album under their Double Virgo moniker just last month.\n\nWith the album dropping on Matador this October, local fans will have a couple of short months to learn the words and get ready to scream and swoon along when bar italia hit our shores this December. Shit yeah!\n\n",

We are so proud to be #5 on the IMNZ Chart. Independent artists are the grassroots and lifeblood of Kiwi music. And there\u2019s only been a few local indie blues-rock albums on the Official Aotearoa Music Charts over the last decade \u2013 our mate Grant Haua in 2022, and Troy Kingi in 2016, so we\u2019re stoked to be here and rep the Blues in 2025!\u201d\nThe tight, three piece blues rock outfit of band members Brad McMillan (drums), Stu Duncan (bass), and Brian Baker (guitar / vocals)  have garnered a reputation for their powerful and moving live performances, drawing comparisons to Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter, Peter Green and Jeff Beck, while firmly putting their own stamp on the timeless medium that is the blues.\nBB & The Bullets have released three well received singles to date off the album: debut single \u2018Something In The Water\u2019; album title track \u2018High Tide\u2019; and their blues-soaked rendition of the Beatles classic \u2018I Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy)\u2019 which is a huge fan favourite at their live shows. To date, all three singles have enjoyed some excellent blues radio attention, including airplay on Radio New Zealand and around the country, as well as in Germany, USA, and Canada, with \u2018High Tide\u2019 charting at #4 on Roots Music Charts in Australia, achieving #1 on the Roots Music Report Blues Album Chart, #1 on the Blues Rock Album Chart and three songs on the Blues Singles chart.\nHome country of their label Dixiefrog Records has plenty of great things to say about BB & The Bullets, with Paris Move Magazine giving the album a very favourable review, ranking it as a \u2018red heart\u2019 favourite, as has French outlet Zicazic Magazine, and the title track single \u2018High Tide\u2019 has made the weekly playlist of Rolling Stone Magazine, France.\n\u201cThis album proves to be a declaration of love to the roots of the blues, driven by striking live energy and unabashed virtuosity.\u201d \u2013 Zicazic Magazine, France\nWith a well-deserved reputation for their compelling live shows, BB & The Bullets audiences are always wowed by the power and intensity of their performances.\nWith this chart action, it is evident that the blues scene is alive and vibrant on Antipodean shores, grab your mates and don\u2019t miss your chance to check out a blues-rock experience like no other with BB & The Bullets!",

Molly's, Kitty's, Murphy's law.\n\nSee ya soon Justin\n\"Tis our Luck to Know ya \"\n\n8.30 till 12.15 play time\n\nShenanigans are one of New Zealand's most accomplished and sought-after bands in Irish Traditional Music today. This young and exciting group creates a sound that is full of energy & innovation, whilst all the time remaining true to their traditional roots.\n\n\u201cShenanigans was THE breakout band at the Gardens Magic in Wellington NZ\".Their energy was infectious and the crowd response was incredible. They were able to connect to all ages, from Mohawked teenagers, to their grandparents. I had heard good things about them, but the musicianship, and stage presence playing live exceeded every expectation I had.\u201d \u2013 Alan Thompson Director of Irish music Appreciation society 2013.\n\nShenanigans garnered much critical acclaim in recent years, even being compared to super groups such as by respected New Zealand Musician Magazine. Their meteoric rise in the music world was given a massive boost in 2011 when they were released their album Live 2005!. Shenanigans subsequently went on to receive the \u201cBest live act on the Good Morning show\u201d from well-respected Tv Presenter and were also named \u201cBest Jokers\u201d at The New Zealand Jokers Awards in 2012.\n\nFollowing the tremendous success of their debut album \u201cballyscullymuckery\u201d, the group\u2019s profile was further raised with the release of their follow up title, \u201cLive in your Lounge\u201d in 2018.Nz Musician Magazine described it as having \u201cso many good tracks, so much energy, a band in full control and having such fun yet well able to bring things down to a tearful pause\u201d. Most recently Shenanigans was awarded \u201cTop Band of few\u201d by the a guy down the pub.\n\n\nShenanigans is one of New Zealand's hottest bands. Specializing in elegant live preformances, Shenanigans is the perfect choice for your event. Although based in Wellington, we perform regularly throughout the country; including Auckland, Christchurch, and Masterton. Shenanigans is a band seriously worth considering for the best possible wedding music that inspires non-stop dancing. In addition to weddings, we often play at charity events, corporate functions, catered affairs, and private parties. Shenanigans plays the best dance music ever written from the 1930's - present, which includes Irish Classics, Country, Rock-n-Roll, Ethnic, Group Participation, and much more. In addition, we keep our repertoire as cool as we can by constantly learning everyone's favourite songs. This hardworking Wellington wedding band spends a tremendous amount of time learning, reviewing, and ultimately perfecting the music required for each engagement.

The beginning of the year is a perfect time to get together and feel the power of community and connection through singing.\nSing for renewal and hope. Sing for harmony, joy, and inspiration. Sing for healing. Sing to regain your strength and empower others.\nSpend the 2 days encircled by a community of like-minded people and focusing on your well-being through singing. Rest, connect, and restore. The weekend is carefully planned so there is plenty of time to sing and to rest in between.\nWe will breathe together, listen, create beautiful sounds, let go of our worries, and lift each other to a sense of fulfillment and joy. And to make the event even more special, Lala will be cooking an authentic Malagasy dinner on Saturday night (an experience not to be missed).\nJonathan Berkahn and Lala Simpson have been working together, leading workshops and performing for many years. They are both highly skilled song leaders who lead from the heart and joyfully share their gifts. You will be in safe hands. ALL SINGERS OF ALL LEVELS OF ABILITY ARE WELCOME!!!\nJonathan will teach a mix of pop, folk and original songs, and Lala will teach a mix of songs from South Africa, Georgia, Madagascar and community songs.\nIf you are coming from out of town, the Home of Compassion offers some accommodation with reasonable rates which includes breakfast. Please contact them directly to enquire islandbay@compassion.org.nz\nSCHEDULE\nSaturday, 17th of January: This first part of the retreat will be at the Island Bay Presbyterian Church.

This circle welcomes men at all stages \u2014 whether you\u2019re navigating change, looking for connection, or simply want a place to be heard.\nEngage in open, honest conversations and experience the kind of connection that\u2019s rare but meaningful. There\u2019s no expectation to speak \u2014 your presence alone is valued. The circle follows a respectful, non-judgmental format, prioritizing safety, confidentiality, and authenticity.\nOptional Plant-Based Dinner\nAfter the circle, stay for a wholesome plant-based dinner and dessert ($15). Sharing a meal is a simple way to extend the sense of community and connection. This gathering is offered on a non-profit basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us after this free event for an optional plant-based dinner and dessert for only $15 (or $5 for students).\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. Over the years, Andre has come to value the power of sitting in circle\u2014of men coming together in honesty, vulnerability, and presence to witness and support one another. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 06:15 PM\nArrive to Bhakti Lounge\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:15 PM - 07:15 PM\nMen's Circle: Authentic Relating\nHost: Andre\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:15 PM - 08:15 PM\nOptional Plant-based dinner and dessert!\n\n\n",

The focus is on camping, coffee, and having a fun time with relatively short kayaking times on the water.\n\nThe schedule for Wellingtonians is: on the Thursday 29th Ferry over to Picton, in at 12:30, launch from Picton beach head over to Kumoto, tents up, Friday - paddle around the Bay of Many Coves, stop for coffee / lunch / chips / shower at Punga Cove, stay at Camp Bay. Maybe a quick trip over to Bumine Island with empty boats. Saturday night at Ratimira for camping / snoozing. Sunday - up early, on water at 8am, paddle back to Picton in by 12, lunch, on 1pm sailing. So 4 days with Blumine as an optional paddle, mostly shortish trips. We might shift the plan around depending on the weather, but that sets out the general plan.\n\nFor the ferry you need to book your own tickets and I would urge you to get your ferry tickets now as they go fast. If you are concerned about the weather get the fully refundable tickets. When you buy your ticket select the \"kayak\" option. Any questions ask them in the comments below.\n\nAlso check out other Trips & Adventurous Activities in Wellington.",

    "long_description": "SUMAC - WELLINGTON - VALHALLAH\nBanished Music, Whammy Bar, and Valhalla are proud to present the long-awaited New Zealand debut of experimental post-metal trio SUMAC.\nFormed in 2014, the powerhouse trio comprised of Aaron Turner (guitar, vocals; Isis, Old Man Gloom), Brian Cook (bass; Russian Circles, Botch), and Nick Yacyshyn (drums; Baptists) are renowned for merging crushing heaviness with improvisational freedom, exploring the boundaries between structure and chaos.\n\nSUMAC have built a reputation as a fearsome live band. Visceral and cathartic shows where crushing riffs & sprawling drones collide with extended bursts of wild improvisation. In 2024, the band released their critically acclaimed album The Healer, a sweeping, transformative work spanning four monumental tracks. The record dives deep into themes of regeneration, suffering, and spiritual reconstruction \u2014 a testament to the band\u2019s ability to meld raw power with emotional depth.\n\nThe experimental metal trio\u2019s four-song, 76-minute album is the peak of their career. It\u2019s dense and invigorating, highlighting the band\u2019s dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. - Pitchfork\n\nSoon after the release SUMAC teamed up with poet and sound artist Moor Mother to release The Film, a boundary-pushing collaborative album. Released via Thrill Jockey in April 2025, the record unfolds as a cinematic journey across eight \u201cscenes,\u201d merging SUMAC\u2019s heavy, jazz-inflected textures with Moor Mother\u2019s incisive spoken-word commentary.\n\nSUMAC\u2019s work has always been about transition between different states of being. Our sense of normal, and indeed our sense of life, is now being shaken. We don\u2019t know what is coming next. We are looking for pointers towards the future, as well as things to hold onto in the moment.\nNew Zealanders, don\u2019t miss this rare and powerful journey into uncharted sonic terrain.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Acclaimed experimental metal trio finally make their New Zealand debut in January 2026, with dates booked for Auckland & Wellington\nBanished Music, Whammy Bar, and Valhalla are proud to present the long-awaited New Zealand debut of experimental post-metal trio SUMAC.\nFormed in 2014, the powerhouse trio comprised of Aaron Turner (guitar, vocals; Isis, Old Man Gloom), Brian Cook (bass; Russian Circles, Botch), and Nick Yacyshyn (drums; Baptists) are renowned for merging crushing heaviness with improvisational freedom, exploring the boundaries between structure and chaos. \n\nSUMAC have built a reputation as a fearsome live band. Visceral and cathartic shows where crushing riffs & sprawling drones collide with extended bursts of wild improvisation. In 2024, the band released their critically acclaimed album The Healer, a sweeping, transformative work spanning four monumental tracks. The record dives deep into themes of regeneration, suffering, and spiritual reconstruction \u2014 a testament to the band\u2019s ability to meld raw power with emotional depth.\n\nThe experimental metal trio\u2019s four-song, 76-minute album is the peak of their career. It\u2019s dense and invigorating, highlighting the band\u2019s dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. - Pitchfork\n\nSoon after the release SUMAC teamed up with poet and sound artist Moor Mother to release The Film, a boundary-pushing collaborative album. Released via Thrill Jockey in April 2025, the record unfolds as a cinematic journey across eight \u201cscenes,\u201d merging SUMAC\u2019s heavy, jazz-inflected textures with Moor Mother\u2019s incisive spoken-word commentary. \n\nSUMAC\u2019s work has always been about transition between different states of being. Our sense of normal, and indeed our sense of life, is now being shaken. We don\u2019t know what is coming next. We are looking for pointers towards the future, as well as things to hold onto in the moment. \nNew Zealanders, don\u2019t miss this rare and powerful journey into uncharted sonic terrain.",

He has since gone on to write for film and television and produce multi-million-selling albums. His most recent is \u2018The Summer Portraits\u2019. Written in 2025, it is the result of a cascade of personal memories triggered by sun, summer, and family holidays. Here, he returns to the lush full-band textures of earlier works.

    "long_description": "UNLEASH THE VOICES OF YOUR SUN AND MOON\nBook Soon for this special day workshop and explore and unleash the power of your Voice and Astrological Archetypes!!\n\nWe are blessed that Alignment Coach and Healer, Clare Babbage is visiting the Wellington Region from Napier, and collaborating with Voice Empowerment Coach and Healer, Bryony Rogers from Heartsong Healing, in this exciting, unique offering.\n\nThis workshop is a specially designed, transformative full day experience of Embodied Astrological Archetypes and Conscious Sound and Voice Practices.\n\nBOOK HERE - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nOn the date of the full moon, the energies of the sun and the moon stand face to face \u2014 illuminating both our outer expression and our inner world.\n\nIn astrology, the sun represents our fullest expression, our vitality, and the way we are here to shine. The moon reveals our emotional landscape, our inner rhythms, and often the fears that arise when we dare to live that full expression. Together, they form a powerful dialogue between structure and flow, logic and emotion, masculine and feminine.\n\nIn this workshop, Clare will guide you into an embodied exploration of your own sun and moon, inviting you to feel these two archetypes within your body and notice where they support, resist, or balance each other.\n\nBryony will lead you into vocal practices that bring these energies into sound and voice \u2014 giving expression to what is often left unspoken. Through voice, you\u2019ll release what holds you back and discover new harmony between your inner and outer selves.\n\nThis full moon is the perfect moment to unleash the voices of your sun and moon \u2014 and to step more fully into clarity, balance, and authentic expression.\n\nThe timing of this workshop gives you a unique opportunity to tune into these planets and benefit from their placement in the collective astrology.\n\nThe workshop will begin with the opportunity to explore powerful, enjoyable, accessible Voice Practices which open, align and strengthen your expression - and create physiological changes in your energy field.\n\nWe will then directly, bodily experience the energies of each of the Celestial Bodies through Embodied Astrology, guided by Clare.\n\nWe will integrate these energies, through further Voice Practices, including improvisation, healing chants and songs.\n\nThese two modalities will be carefully interwoven in an enjoyable, rich day's workshop that will benefit all participants.\n\nThere will be guided space in the workshop to integrate the energetic shifts and discoveries of both the Voice Practices and the Astrology.\n\nThis special workshop takes place on Saturday February 7th, 10am-4.30pm - we hope you can join us\n\nAt the Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Paraparaumu.\n\nINVESTMENT:\n\nYour investment for this day is $233. Shared lunch.\nSome concessions are available - please contact us by email .\n\nPayment by card here - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nPlease contact us with any questions at all.\n\n",

My Nonno (Leslie George Moleta) spotted my Nonna (Rosina Elvira Barnao) at the Zino-Toscano wedding where she was a bridesmaid.

    "long_description": "On the 12 February 1909, the SS Penguin sank in Cook Strait in a raging southerly storm with the loss of 72 lives, one of the worst maritime disasters in NZ history.  Many of those who died were woman and children, as their lifeboats capsized in the wild sea. \nAlthough the Captain was heavily criticised, it is still not clear what the ship hit nor where, as the wreck of the Penguin has never been located. \nThe tragedy stunned Wellington and a day of mourning was called for 16 February.  The city came to a standstill as many of those who died were brought up to Karori Cemetery for burial in a long procession of cabs and lorries.\nTo commemorate this tragedy the Friends will be undertaking a guided tour of most of the Penguin graves on Sunday 8th February. \nThe tour duration is approximately 2 hours long.\nThis tour is suitable for people with moderate fitness. The route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. Surefootedness is required.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee). Children under 12 are free.\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nNote:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you one hour before the tour start time by email and on our Facebook page. The booking fee is non-refundable.\nPlease dress appropriately for the conditions. While we do our best to guide you on a safe walking route, during the winter months the ground can become slippery in places.\nSome of our walks require a moderate degree of fitness and are not suited for those with limited mobility. Please read the tour descriptions carefully to check that they will be suitable for you.\nThere is only one toilet which is located by the cemetery office at the main entrance.\nPlease meet us at the shelter (shown as the Historic Chapel on the map at the main entrance)\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Karori Cemetery.",

    "long_description": "STEAMS is an integrated approach to learning topics of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths, and Society that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. Its aim is to teach real world skills through engaging methods whilst allowing individuals to be creative. This involves immersing tamariki into projects and activities that develop innovation and champion curiosity. STEAMS is not \u2018play based learning\u2019 but focused learning through an integrated hands-on approach allowing children to take risks and explore their own curiosity in a subject without time barriers.\nAt the Ministry of Inspiration we offer STEAMS learning each term for Year 1-8 students. Once a week students will attend a class at Waterlea Racecourse, Blenheim on TUESDAY or THURSDAY. STEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) start at 9am and finish at 2:45pm on TUESDAY. Little STEAMerS operates from 9-12 on THURSDAY. STEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) operates on THURSDAY from 9am to 245 pm. \nInquiry, collaboration, and an emphasis on process-based learning are at the heart of the STEAM approach. Each term the classes will have a focus which drives the learning and our amazing teachers create opportunities to help each student develop their understanding, improve their skills and gain knowledge in a range of topics.\nStudents who participate in STEAM learning:\n\u00b7 think outside the box\n\u00b7 feel safe to express innovative and creative ideas\n\u00b7 feel comfortable doing hands-on learning\n\u00b7 take ownership over their learning\n\u00b7 work collaboratively with others\n\u00b7 understand the ways that science, maths, the arts, and technology work together\n\u00b7 become increasingly curious about the world around them and feel empowered to change it for the better.\nWhen does it meet, and where?\nThe school is held during school terms.\nSTEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) TUESDAY, 9-245.\nSTEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) THURSDAY, 9-245\nLittle STEAMerS (ages 5-6) THURSDAY 12-3.\nLocation:  Waterlea Racecourse, enter off of Linton St.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe students come for a paid three-week trial-as a new student you pay for that through Humanitix.\nIf both family and teacher feel there is a good fit for the child in the class, they continue for the rest of the term. You are then invoiced for the full term less the amount paid for the Trial.\nPayment is by term, with a cost of $73 incl. GST We have a limited number of scholarships available that are awarded on a term by term basis for those with financial need for 25% off. \nLittle STEAMerS is $30 incl. GST.\nWill my child\u2019s school mind that they miss a day per week?\nYou will need to inform the child\u2019s school that he or she will be at STEAMS School one day per week. To date we have not encountered any issues around accommodating a child\u2019s participation in STEAMS School, and many of the region\u2019s schools are very supportive of the programme. Once enrolled, you are encouraged to inform the teacher and office staff that your child should be marked present for the day they attend STEAMS School, as they will be attending an academic school as opposed to being absent due to illness or other reasons.",
    "description": "STEAMS is not \u2018play based learning\u2019 but focused learning through an integrated hands-on approach allowing children to take risks and explore their own curiosity in a subject without time barriers.\nAt the Ministry of Inspiration we offer STEAMS learning each term for Year 1-8 students.\nOnce a week students will attend a class at Waterlea Racecourse, Blenheim on TUESDAY or THURSDAY.\nIf both family and teacher feel there is a good fit for the child in the class, they continue for the rest of the term.\nGST We have a limited number of scholarships available that are awarded on a term by term basis for those with financial need for 25% off."

    "long_description": "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention initially developed for emotional disorders. It is now widely used in supporting people to deal with the challenges of physical ill-health. Professionals from various backgrounds can learn to use a simplified CBT skills set, and use of these skills enables them to be more effective in managing aspects of their patients\u2019 distress.\nThe training is a mix of theory, skills demonstration and skills practice, giving participants a better understanding of the applicability of the skill set in their area of practice and providing some skills to take away. Training sessions are spaced to allow participants to use their new skills in their clinical practice. Each participant reflects on their learning and their work with a specific patient, and the whole group reflects on lessons learned. In this way, learning remains rooted in participants\u2019 clinical practice. These CBT courses are consistently evaluated highly by participants.\nThe Course\nTeaching will be commenced with 2 days of in person sessions. 19th and 20th Feb 2026 at Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington and subsequently 2 sessions on-line via Zoom. These will be either 18th or 19th March an 22nd or 23rd April 2026.\nAttendance at all sessions is mandatory to complete the course.\nThe courses cost is $850 per person (incl GST).\nThe Trainers\nKathy Burn was a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Palliative Care who went on to train in CBT and to develop the CBT service at St Christopher\u2019s Hospice, London. She now works in CBT in chronic pain, and she teaches and supervises CBT trainees at the institute of Psychiatry, London.\nKathryn Mannix was a Palliative Medicine Consultant and CBT therapist. She developed \u2018CBT First Aid\u2019 to enable palliative care clinicians to adapt skills from CBT into their clinical practice. She is an author. There are insights into her use of CBT in her books With the End in Mind and Listen.\nTerms and Conditions\nAttendance: In order to create a learning community for each course, it is important that each person on a course attends every session and is able to join in the discussions by keeping up with the course. By accepting a place on a particular course, you agree to attend all the sessions, to arrive on time, and to work alongside your group members during the session to support each other's learning. Each session builds on the last, and you'll be asked to put your new learning into practice in- between sessions. Building learning groups in this way means we can't add new trainees after a course has begun.\nWe are not able to run catch-up sessions for sessions missed. If you miss sessions, you may be asked to withdraw from the course and no refunds will be given.\nRefunds/Canellations: Once you sign up and pay, we won't be able to refund your payment unless we can reallocate your place to another person before the course begins. The deadline for cancelling your place is 28 days before the day and time of the first session. If you cancel and we can fill your place with another person, we'll offer you the choice of a refund or a place on a future course, if places are available. We will do our best to fill your place, but we can't promise this. Refunds will incur an administration fee.\nDates and Times of Sessions: all dates and times are given in NZ time, and this varies over the year. It is up to you to check the correct time in your time zone: you may find this website useful to check your own time zone with Auckland NZ time on each specific date: https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/\nTrainers: we have a team of trainers, all of whom are experienced CBT therapists and trainers, and all are familiar with applying CBT in physical health settings. Different sessions may be taught by different trainers, or by 'guest appearances' by some of our team. The team of trainers will ensure there is continuity of content and of learning as the course progresses.\nSpecial circumstances: Sometimes, life events appear unexpectedly. If something unexpected prevents you from attending, please let us know as early as you can, and we will give consideration to how we might be able to support you to continue your training if that is what you wish to do.",

We acknowledge Taranaki wh\u0101nui, and all the peoples who have lived here, and their close relationship with the lands and waters.\n\n\nThe Capital City Complex Systems Symposium 2026 will explore cutting-edge knowledge of complex systems and complexity, and how this knowledge is being used to better understand systems and drive system change. It will be held in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand, during summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe theme for the conference is \u2018Understanding complex systems: Theory, practice and impact\u2019.\n\nOur programme, including speakers, can be viewed here\n\nFollowing the success of previous symposia in 2023 and 2024, this event will continue to foster interdisciplinary, cross-sector and cross-society collaboration in complex systems thinking, research and action.

A particular focus will be how complexity science has evolved and how it is informing contemporary actions and solutions for prosperous, resilient, equitable and democratic societies \u2013 amid growing global challenges.\nThe symposium will explore complexity through a rich interdisciplinary lens, bringing together philosophical and epistemological perspectives alongside practical insights from fields including artificial intelligence, infrastructure, health, education, climate, and the environment, and cutting-edge insights from M\u0101ori and local communities. Attendees will engage with understandings of complexity, examine innovative methods and tools for working within complex systems, and discuss the implications for public policy, governance, leadership and Indigenous system change.\nThis inclusive, supportive event is essential for anyone interested in understanding the trajectory and practical applications of complex systems knowledge \u2014 including researchers, leaders, policymakers, innovators, changemakers, practitioners, and students. Whether you\u2019re deeply experienced in complex systems research or newly curious about its potential, the symposium will provide valuable insights, networking opportunities, and inspiration.\n\n\nWe are taking expressions of interest (EOI) for an optional pre-event workshop on Monday 23 February, also held at the National Library.

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

The huge contribution of Dr Karen Grylls is celebrated in \u2018Ara Hura \u2014 A Visionary Journey\u2019. \nIt\u2019s fitting that this Aotearoa Festival of the Arts concert involves the choir Dr Grylls founded 28 years ago. Voices New Zealand debuted with a concert at the same festival in 1998. It has gone on to build a reputation for excellence in the music world. For this celebratory concert, the choir is joined by taonga p\u016boro artist Horomona Horo, leading instrumentalists, and a chamber ensemble from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. \nThe concert centrepiece is Robert Wiremu\u2019s Re-imagined Mozart: Erebus. The programme also features a new commission from Takerei Komene, as well as waiata by Ng\u0101p\u014d and Pimia Wehi. This highlights Dr Grylls\u2019 pioneering collaborations that reshaped Aotearoa\u2019s choral landscape. Her expertise as a choral clinician is sought internationally, and she regularly conducts masterclasses and workshops in Wales, England, North America, Canada and Australia. \nThis marks Dr Grylls\u2019 final appearance as Music Director of Voices New Zealand. It\u2019s a rare opportunity to celebrate her vision, artistry, and legacy.",

It captures Maltese at his most personal, trading irony for honesty and humour for vulnerability.\n\nMuch like kindred spirits Randy Newman and Father John Misty, beneath Maltese\u2019s sumptuous melodies and classic pop craftsmanship there\u2019s always a lyric that stops you in your tracks \u2013 sometimes breaking your heart, sometimes making you laugh. Across the album\u2019s eleven tracks, Maltese\u2019s trademark wit is still present but wielded with restraint, often emerging through self-deprecation and quiet revelation.\n\nHaving first established himself in 2018 with his debut Bad Contestant, Maltese has since evolved into one of the UK\u2019s finest young songwriters. The albums that followed cemented his reputation for transforming the mundane into something dream-like, his piano harmonies, playful lyricism and quintessentially British wit resonating around the world.\n\nIn late 2024, Maltese embarked on a headline tour across Asia, Australia and New Zealand, following sold-out runs through the US, Europe and the UK \u2013 including his biggest performances to date at The Wiltern in Los Angeles and London\u2019s Electric Brixton. With Hers, he now steps into an even bigger chapter: playing to larger rooms than ever before and connecting with an audience that continues to grow from Sydney to S\u00e3o Paulo, Jakarta to Tokyo.\n\nAudiences can expect an enchanting live experience that blends Maltese\u2019s new material with an favourites spanning his six-album catalogue \u2013 poetic, wry, and unashamedly human.\n\n",

Playing Wellington\u2019s San Fran on Saturday 11 April, followed by The Powerstation in Auckland on Sunday 12 April. \nTickets on sale Thursday 2 October 12pm from helmetmusic.com\nHelmet has built a reputation as one of the most commanding forces in the underground scene. Born at the dawn of the rage-filled 90\u2019s, Helmet fiercely holds space for multiple generations of alternative fans seeking the vital energy of hostile riffs and inventive metronomic groove. With a refusal to fit neatly into a genre, Helmet\u2019s music creates an atmosphere best known live; part industrial, part hip-hop, part existential sermon. \n\nFormed in 1989 in NYC by Page Hamilton, Helmet has been crushing stages for over three decades. In that time they have only come to Aotearoa / NZ a handful of times, most recently in 2023 during their sold out Best of Helmet 1989-2023 tour, with 13th Floor declaring \u201ca complete evening of essential music from one of heavy music\u2019s most essential bands.\u201d With 35 years of rocking behind them, Helmet are at the top of their game.

Born at the dawn of the rage-filled 90\u2019s, Helmet fiercely holds space for multiple generations of alternative fans seeking the vital energy of hostile riffs and inventive metronomic groove. With a refusal to fit neatly into a genre, Helmet\u2019s music creates an atmosphere best known live; part industrial, part hip-hop, part existential sermon.\n\n\"Helmet stripped away the excess, dialled in the precision, and redefined what heaviness could sound like without succumbing to clich\u00e9s.\" Pitchfork\n\nFormed in 1989 in NYC by Page Hamilton, Helmet has been crushing stages for over three decades. In that time they have only come to Aotearoa / NZ a handful of times, most recently in 2023 during their sold out Best of Helmet 1989-2023 tour, with 13th Floor declaring \u201ca complete evening of essential music from one of heavy music\u2019s most essential bands.\u201d With 35 years of rocking behind them, Helmet are at the top of their game.\n\nDon\u2019t miss Helmet in New Zealand next April.\n\nTickets on sale Thursday 2 October, 12pm\n\n",

    "long_description": "Day 1 \u2013 May 10, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: Working with Dissociative Parts and Their Voices in Complex Trauma and Dissociative Disorders\nOverview:\nThis seminar focuses on adapting EMDR for individuals with dissociative disorders, using the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) Dolores has developed. It provides strategies for working with dissociative parts and their voices and integrating a trauma-informed approach to inner conflict safely from early treatment stages.\nKey Learning Points:\n\u00b7         Identifying and working with dissociative parts and their voices.\n\u00b7         Understanding the function and purpose of \u201chostile\u201d parts.\n\u00b7         Addressing dissociative phobias through EMDR informed techniques.\n\u00b7         Managing resistance and treatment impasses.\n\u00b7         Structuring work with dissociative parts effectively.\nProgram Description:\nAfter many early cautions about the potential dangers of using EMDR with individuals suffering from dissociative disorders, limited methods have been offered for adapting standard EMDR procedures to this specific population. Based on these early cautions, EMDR is still considered by many clinicians as limited to the treatment of traumatic memories in high-functioning dissociative clients and only after a long preparation phase that depends on other treatment modalities. Confined by this conceptualisation, the use of EMDR is too often limited, and many survivors of severe traumatisation are unable to benefit from EMDR reprocessing and, if at all, only much later in the treatment process.\nDolores Mosquera developed (with AnabelGonzalez, M.D.) the Progressive Approach model for treating complex trauma and dissociation (2012) and the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) (2019, 2025). Using this trauma and AIP-informed models, clinicians can safely utilise a wide range of EMDR interventions (including BLS) from early in the preparatory phase of treatment for patients with dissociative disorders.\nIn this seminar, she will present her current practice of working with clients, including video demonstrations. Mosquera's deft clinical skills and ground-breaking innovative thinking teach a middle ground between \"dissociation blind\" aggressive EMDR interventions and overly cautious delays to the use of EMDR reprocessing.\nMany dissociative clients have difficulty with hostile, critical voices. The internal conflict is sometimes so intense that the person even has difficulty carrying on an ordinary conversation. One factor that affects this conflict is how the patient deals with the voices or parts of the self.\nKey Program Content:\nIdentify the internal system of dissociation and internal voices that are hostile and critical\nHow to read the function and purpose behind the saboteur parts of self\nUsing compassion and understanding to help deal with dissociative phobias within the internal system\nSkills to reduce impasses and resistance that may complicate or reduce the efficacy of the treatment\nSpecific steps to organize the work with hostile parts and voices\n Days 2\u20133 \u2013 May 11\u201312, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: From Fragmentation to Integration: A Master Class in Treating Complex Trauma and Dissociation\nFormat: 2-Day Masterclass: Three Clinical Cases from Start to Finish\nAcross two days, Dolores will present three distinct new cases illustrating varying levels of dissociation \u2014 including one with frequent switching and no initial Adult Self. Each session is interactive, highlighting the therapeutic process from assessment to completion.\nOver two immersive days, this advanced master class offers a rare opportunity to observe and analyse complete therapeutic processes under the expert guidance of Dolores Mosquera.\n\nDolores will present three new and distinct clinical cases, each representing different manifestations of complex trauma and dissociation \u2014 including one client who experiences frequent switching and begins therapy without an integrated adult self.\nParticipants will follow these clients\u2019 journeys from the initial stages of therapy through to treatment completion, gaining deep insight into decision-making, pacing, and the integration of EMDR strategies within complex systems. The format is designed to be highly interactive and reflective, combining video demonstrations, live commentary, and group discussion to deepen understanding of safe, flexible, and attuned clinical practice when working with dissociative clients.\nThis master class is ideal for clinicians seeking to refine their skills, expand their conceptual framework, and enhance clinical confidence when navigating the challenges of trauma-related dissociation.\nAdditional Details\n\u00b7         Eligibility: Must have completed at least Part One of EMDR Basic Training (University of Otago or equivalent).\n\u00b7         Certification: Participants receive a Professional Development Certificate of Attendance.\n\u00b7         Dietary needs: Provided upon registration.\n\u00b7         Parking: Paid on-site parking available.\n\u00b7         Accommodation: Discounted rates at a local hotel (discount code to be posted on the event site).",

    "long_description": "Meet Getdown Services \u2013 your new favourite band and one of the UK\u2019s hottest word-of-mouth acts! The brilliantly offbeat cult British duo has been turning heads across Britain and Europe with their balls-to-the-walls live shows, tongue-in-cheek wit, razor-sharp lyrics and infectious disco-fuelled grooves, teetering between chaos and genius. And now, after selling out tours across the UK and Europe, they\u2019re bringing their riotous show down under for the first time in May/June 2026 \u2013 with shows in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Wellington, presented by I OH YOU and MG Live. \nTickets go on sale Friday 14 November at 10.00am local time, with MG Live presale commencing Thursday 13 November at 10.00am local time. Sign up for early access to the MG Live presale here.               \n\u201cI reckon we get people asking us to come to Australia probably every day, and everyone in England is moving there, so will be good to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\u201cAlways been one of those places where you\u2019re like, \u2018Fair enough, but I can\u2019t be arsed with that. It looks mad \u2013 there\u2019s snakes and also it takes 40 hours to get there.\u2019 Will be good fun, though! Went to New Zealand to see a mate of ours get married a few years ago and thought it was a lovely country and I really liked those pies they have. It felt quite similar to the UK in a lot of ways, so playing gigs there should be fun!\u201d\nGetdown Services\n\nFor those in the know, Bristol-based duo Josh Law and Ben Sadler \u2013 aka Getdown Services \u2013 are THE must-see new act of the year. And if you don\u2019t know yet, you will soon \u2026 and you\u2019ll wish you got in early! Named as \u201cone to watch\u201d at this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival and dubbed (by the band themselves) \u201cBritain\u2019s Best Band\u201d, their live shows are equal parts smart, sweaty and gloriously unhinged. Their sound is a wild blend of scrappy indie disco, twisted funk and post-punk energy, turning the absurdity of modern Britain into dancefloor gold.        \n \nThe pair met at school in Minehead, Somerset and now make music together at home in Bristol \u2013 churning out what Rolling Stone called \u201cpower disco with unrepentant silliness\u201d with a healthy dose of satire and swagger. Their highly lauded debut album Crisps (Breakfast Records, 2023) showcased their eclectic danceable grooves and biting social commentary, and a mix of sharp, funny social observations wrapped in irresistible, funk-fuelled rhythms. Follow-up EPs Your Medal\u2019s In The Post, Crumbs and latest, Primordial Slot Machine, cemented their cult status, alongside an arsenal of red-hot singles \u2013 including James Bay\u2019s Hat, Dog Dribble, I Got Views and Eat Quiche, Sleep, Repeat.   \n \n \u201cGetdown Services are unrepentantly silly and constantly deliver one of the most joyously deranged live shows \u2013 just one of the best live bands out there!\u201d\n Rolling Stone\n\u201cTheir live show is as daft and as exhilarating as they come. Five stars.\u201d\n Buzz Magazine\n \n \u201cGenuine contenders to being the most exciting and interesting band in the UK right now.\u201d\n CLASH\n\n Getdown Services look set to gobble up the world, one crumb at a time. Whether you\u2019re into danceable chaos, satirical genius or just want to be ahead of the curve, Getdown Services are the band you didn\u2019t know you needed \u2013 until now! Britain\u2019s favourite new band are about to become yours too! \n\nMG LIVE TERMS OF SALE\n\nhttps://mg.live/termsofsale",

    "long_description": "It\u2019s a stage show that covers vast rivers of galaxies in the cosmos, the ecosystems of Earth, and the structure of the human brain. Emergence is the latest show by English physicist, presenter, and personality Professor Brian Cox. He takes to the stage at TSB Arena to contemplate the dazzling complexity of the universe and how it\u2019s built on profoundly simple principles. \nEmergence is also a scientific history of 400 years of human discovery. How did we come to understand so much about the cosmos? Guided by mathematics, curiosity, and an aesthetic sense of symmetry, our species has begun to read the story of the Universe. We\u2019ve started to carry our spacecraft to the edge of the solar system and outwards to the stars. Brian\u2019s engaging style makes these questions come to life. The audience will be left awestruck and thrilled as the show covers vast topics in an accessible way. \nBrian has appeared in many landmark science programs for BBC radio and television over the last 15 years, from the Peabody Award-winning Wonders of the Solar System to the worldwide hit series The Planets. His previous touring show, Horizons, was performed to nearly half a million people across the world.",

He spends more time in the pharmacy than the gym and is subjected to relentless eye rolls from his kids. \nDavies is a staple of British television. He\u2019s known for his performance as the eponymous hero in the long-running TV series Jonathan Creek, and as a permanent panellist on QI. His talk show, Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled, recently reached its seventh season. He is also one of the UK\u2019s best-loved comedians.",

    "long_description": "After three years of closure, the newly renovated and strengthened City Gallery Wellington Te Whare Toi will host the art of Cornelia Parker. The English visual artist is best known for her innovative and contemporary sculpture and installation art. Her large-scale, immersive installations explore themes of destruction and reconstruction, transformation and metamorphosis. Objects are exploded, crushed, and suspended in a world upended and remade anew.\nCurated by independent UK-based curator Andrea Schlieker and City Gallery Wellington\u2019s Senior Curator Aaron Lister, City Gallery Wellington's exhibition will encompass Parker\u2019s long career as an artist. This includes an immersive sound and light installation, \u2018Stolen Thunder\u2019. The work gathers the sounds of approaching storms from around the globe and across time. The exhibition will also showcase her paintings, photos, films, and sculptures.\n\u201cI have always said this is the one exhibition I want to do before I die,\u201d said Charlotte Davy, Ringatohu Toi Director Art and City Gallery Wellington. \u201cI have been following Cornelia Parker\u2019s work for the last twenty years. Bringing her mischievous, dark, and literally explosive work to Wellington is incredible.\u201d \nParker\u2019s work often fills entire rooms and invites the viewer to move through and around the art. Given its physical scale, the blank canvas of the reopened gallery offers the perfect opportunity to host the exhibition. The exhibition will kick off in October 2026, carrying through to March 2027. \nCharlotte notes the exhibition\u2019s themes are also of particular relevance to Wellington. \u201cI hope that the exhibition and our return to Te Ng\u0101kau Civic Square will reflect our city and also help remake it. We are looking forward to opening with a bang.\u201d\nHero image: \u00a9 Cornelia Parker. Courtesy of the artist and Frith Street Gallery, London",

Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",
