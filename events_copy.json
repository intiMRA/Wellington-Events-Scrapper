    "description": "DOMUS: the duo of Tarik Rahim (Spain) and Mo Aung (Australia) - guide a journey through live improvisational soundscapes incorporating field recordings, synth textures and ethereal vocals.\nTheir performances reflect a fusion of their diverse influences - from lofi psychedelic to abstract electronic beats, contemporary neofolk and a merging of their respective South American and Southeast Asian heritage.\nWhile being accomplished artists in their own right with this project they blend their sounds into a unified, compelling and resonant experience.\nhttps://domuss.bandcamp.com/album/you-lead-me-into-silence --- Juniper May is the latest solo project of P\u014dneke artist Lora May.\nUsing an SP-404, she channels and transfigures samples of found sounds, synths and field recordings into melodic, distant and estranged pop songs."

    "description": "Our track maintenance and planting working bees are focussing on plant species diversity rather than large planting quantities.\nWe have ordered 500 special trees from the Berhampore Nursery.\nWe are in this for the long haul and a forest that contains a wide range of plant species will, in turn, attract a wider range of birds, lizards, and invertebrates.\nA wider range of plant species also allows for the forest to naturally regenerate and helps prevent weed species from establishing.\nTools are provided, bring sturdy shoes and a water bottle, Working bees are held every Sunday in June (except June 1st - Kings Birthday Weekend) and August 2025."

Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s classic novel, which celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, we are seeking a cast of 12-14; a range of ages, mostly 20s-40s, with one 50+ male role, and two opportunities for singers (1M/1F) of any age who may also play other roles in the ensemble.\nSet early in the Roaring Twenties, with its jazz music, gangsters, bootleg liquor, extravagance, and intractable social divides, the story sees Nick Carraway drawn into this decadent and hedonistic world and captivated by his mysterious neighbour Gatsby, until he is disillusioned by the events that unfold.\nAuditions 9-10 August, with callbacks on 11 August.\nSeason dates are 29 October to 8 November.\nFor more information on the show, its characters, and other requirements, please click here and complete the audition form at this link: https://www.wellingtonrepertory.org.nz/auditions/"

    "description": "The Photonics is an optical sound project of Daniel Beban and Tim Barlow.\nTaking a cue from early experiments in light and sound technology, various light emitting sources (including ultraviolet therapy torches, strobes, remote controls and regular LED and tungsten bulbs) are modulated into sound via solar panels, resulting in an immediate and direct transposition of the optical into the audible.\n--- Class War on the Dance Floor is the solo project of Marika Pratley inspired by trance 80s synth pop and contemporary hip hop, using the Deluge.\nSometimes dreamy, sometimes upbeat anti-capitalist anthems.\n--- Meeps - Ambrosial explorations of Sound/Mind Theonomaspheres alongside analog synthesis and digital visual craftiness."

    "description": "Tuesday Wellbeing Seminars: Peace Over Panic: Rewiring the Anxious Mind How do we respond when the mind spirals, when uncertainty clouds our judgement, or when we find ourselves at a personal breaking point?\nThis workshop draws from ancient and time-tested wisdom found in yoga philosophy \u2014 especially the Bhagavad Gita \u2014 to explore how anxiety and inner conflict can become turning points for insight and conscious action.\nRather than avoiding or suppressing discomfort, the Gita offers a way to meet it \u2014 with clarity, honesty, and meaningful direction.\nThrough a blend of philosophical reflection and grounded tools, we\u2019ll explore how to steady the mind and reconnect with deeper purpose in the face of pressure or doubt.\nThe seminar will be followed by a delicious plant-based dinner together, all included in your ticket!"

    "description": "Wellington\u2019s iconic Old St Paul\u2019s (OSP) will play host to a transcendent new series in August, partnering with the Pyramid Club to present Altared States, a unique electronic music experience.\nThis series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\nAbout the Artists Ludus is the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard.\nStephen Gallagher is an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance.\nIt\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d About the Venue Built in 1866, Old St Paul\u2019s is a prime example of timber Gothic Revival architecture and one of Aotearoa\u2019s most important historic places."
