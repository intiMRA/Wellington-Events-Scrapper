    "long_description": "Meditation - Journeys Every Tuesday Evening\nEvery Tuesday night we welcome you into the magic of the bell tent. The tent is lovely during the day, but as it gets dark, it takes on a magical feeling. Fairy lights and crystals lit by gently changing coloured lights. We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle. Arniya then dances the energy in with Celestial Energy Movement, for the group. This creates a vortex of Divine power into the middle of the tent. Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\nThis is normally a fairly jovial group. Sacredness is embraced fully, but not at the expense of a good giggle when it\u2019s called for.\n\nYou can choose to join us on a casual basis or join the V.U. program and get dream time support and access to past journey recordings. The V.U is booked monthly. Payment options are below. Click here for more details\n\nSpaces are limited, so please book in and be on time.\n\n",

But instead of craning your neck to look up, A Different View invites you to experience Michelangelo\u2019s genius from an entirely new perspective \u2013 from above and up close.\n\nThis immersive experience, completed with guided audio, allows visitors to admire every intricate detail of Michelangelo\u2019s work, many from just two metres away \u2013 offering a far more intimate and comfortable viewing experience than the Vatican itself, where some 20,000 people queue daily for a glimpse.\n\nWith no time constraints, visitors can allow these masterpieces to truly soak in.\n\nAs an addition to \u2013 and to complete \u2013 Michelangelo \u2014 A Different View, reproductions of 14 of these impressive frescoes await visitors inside the exhibition. Scenes from the lives of Jesus and Moses, painted by Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli, provide additional historical background and allow for a deeper insight into this epoch.\n\nEnhancing the exhibition further, VIP guided tours will be led by Dr Christopher Longhurst, a theologian and aesthete who served for 17 years as an operatore didattico at the Sistine Chapel, St Peter\u2019s Basilica, and the Vatican Museums' Papal Art Galleries.\n\n* Booking and credit card fees apply",

Students will learn measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting and soldering.\n\nThen we move on to making a practice ring set with a Cabochon stone (a cabochon has a flat bottom and a smooth, domed top) in a Bezel Setting.\n\nAs you work through your practice ring and setting, you can move on to working in silver and produce another ring with a cabochon stone that you really love. This way, you will learn the basics as you go on your practice ring, before taking the next step in costly silver.\n\nThis class has all materials included in the class fee!\n\nEach student receives a carefully curated materials pack including copper or brass, sterling and fine silver for your ring-making projects, as well as two stones from our supply so you get a good stone for your level of experience.\n\nWe have loads of gorgeous stones of a range of colours, and they are all appropriate for beginner settings.\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking.

At Wellington Classic Literature Club, we read novels that have stood the test of time, whether they were written in 1780, 1880 or even 1980. We meet on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nWe return to Russia for our long summer read! The group's first-ever summer book was Anna Karenina, and we read Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov over the 2018/19 summer. (We were also due to discuss his novel Crime and Punishment, but that was set down for April 2020 and, well, the world had other plans\u2026)\n\nThis year, we read another of Fyodor Dostoevsky's masterworks: The Idiot, which was initially published as a serial in 1868-1869. Dostoevsky scholar Joseph Frank said The Idiot \"is the most personal of all his major works, the book in which he embodies his most intimate, cherished, and sacred convictions.\"\n\nThe story revolves around Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin, a young man returning to Russia after spending several years in a Swiss sanatorium for epilepsy. Dostoevsky had set out to create a protagonist with \"a truly beautiful soul\" and to trace the fate of such an individual as he comes into contact with the brutal reality of contemporary society.\n\nRSVP\nIf you use Facebook, you can RSVP to the event on our Facebook page (above) - it really helps us keep track of numbers. Otherwise, just come along...\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place. After you enter the bar, head to your right (up the step) and through a smaller space with booths to the large carpeted space beyond.\n\nABOUT US\nWellington Classic Literature Club has been running for more than a decade - since the start of 2013 - and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers who come along for particular books or simply when it suits.

With a bloodthirsty hound on their heels, the mysteries of the garden begin to unravel before their eyes.\n\nBelow the Worms is an absurdist magic realism tale that follows the story of two families that live in homes that sit in the same house, split in half. The world is full of unexplained magic that slips into the ordinary, such as the garden of singing worms and the witch that lives next door with her blood thirsty hound. Despite its terrors and delights, the homes live in harmony until a kept secret between the families is revealed, and the world is no longer what the children once thought.\nBelow The Worms is filled with physical theatre, puppetry and live music.\n\nCreated by S.L.U.G (Society for Little Ugly Girls) Theatre Company, Below The Worms had it's debut season in NZ Fringe Festival 2025 for which it won the Parkin Development Award and S.L.U.G won Most Promising Emerging Company.\n\nPresented as part of the Parkin Development Award, Below The Worms is back and more exciting than ever with new direction from Alison Bruce and more delightful writing from Te Ata Tu Patelesio and Sugar Rea-Bruce.",

    "long_description": "The impact of colonisation and urban drift are themes in a theatrical reboot at the next Aotearoa New Zealand Festival of the Arts. \u2018Waiora Te \u016akaip\u014d \u2014 The Homeland\u2019 was originally commissioned by the festival in 1992. Its return 34 years later at the 2026 festival is highly anticipated. It has become a landmark piece of New Zealand theatre \u2014 exploring the tension between past and future. Set in the summer of 1965, the play follows Hone, who brings his family from New Zealand\u2019s East Cape to the South Island in search of a better life. As they gather for a beachside birthday h\u0101ng\u012b with their P\u0101keh\u0101 guests, buried secrets and cultural tensions rise to the surface. Far from their  t\u012bpuna , the family must navigate questions of identity, belonging, and survival. \nWaiora Te \u016akaip\u014d was conceived, written and directed by Hone Kouka (Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101ti Raukawa, Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu). The multi-award-winning writer/director has penned 13 plays. Many have been staged in Aotearoa and further afield in Canada, South Africa, New Caledonia, and the UK. Waiora Te \u016akaip\u014d is presented in partnership with the Aotearoa New Zealand Festival of the Arts, Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, Auckland Theatre Company and Tawata Productions.",

    "long_description": "It\u2019s Westerberg High, where popularity is a matter of life and death. Welcome to \u2018Heathers the Musical\u201d. Based on a movie with the same name, the show is a coming-of-age story dealing with love, heartache, defying expectations, and being true to yourself. It originally premiered in Los Angeles in 2013. Since then, the musical has had record-breaking seasons across the globe. It now makes its professional New Zealand debut in 2026, and Wellington is in line to join the school assembly. Described as a high-octane, black comedy rock musical, Heathers is packed with a mix of ballads and showstoppers. The catchy tunes are written by Kevin Murphy (Desperate Housewives) and Laurence O\u2019Keefe (Legally Blonde: The Musical). \nThe 1989 film starred Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. It quickly achieved cult status among audiences. Both the movie and musical follow high school student Veronica Sawyer. Veronica is just another nobody until she\u2019s unexpectedly taken under the wings of the beautiful and cruel Heathers. When mysterious teen rebel J.D. arrives, Veronica learns that it might kill to be a nobody, but it's murder being a somebody. \nThis special production will feature a stellar Australasian cast. So grab your scrunchies, break out the Corn Nuts and wait for the bell to ring.",

Playwrights from international heavy hitters to brilliant Kiwi voices are represented. It also includes programming from comedies and cabarets to contemporary dance and pantomime. \nBefore or after your show, visit the on-site caf\u00e9, brasserie and restaurant, Chouchou. It opens out onto a deck, where you can take in views across the harbour. Look up to admire the art installation above. Called \u2018Velarium\u2019, it undulates in the wind, mirroring the water in the harbour. \nCirca Theatre began its life in 1976. A breakaway group of actors and theatre practitioners decided that Aotearoa needed a new and innovative approach to theatre. Five decades later, it is still pushing boundaries, making people laugh and cry, and creating theatrical memories. \nIf you don\u2019t have your own Circa memory yet, there\u2019s an opportunity to create one nearly every night of the week.",

We come to know our body and ourselves better through the regular daily practice, practicing with full awareness and experiencing the effect of yoga on our body, mind and soul.\nGoing earlier to bed and not eat too much in the evening are the prerequisites to not give up after few days/weeks though\nAccording to the ancient yoga scriptures, yoga needs to be practiced during the period of sunrise, when an immense amount of Prana (cosmic energy) enters our system nourishing our body, mind, intellect, and soul. Daily practice is crucial if we want to master any skill. You will notice an increased level of energy and positive change in your mood as wel as an improvement in your attention span and concentration. You will experience more inspiration, joy, and love in your daily life.\n\nThe Beginners Course teaches the \u201cSarva Hitta Asanas\u201d from Level 1 - postures that are good for everyone. The Course covers all the foundations you need for an ongoing yoga practice. Loosening your body, the joints, and your mind, the exercises are designed for the complete balance and awakening of energy in body, mind and soul. Experience yoga postures, breath techniques, meditation and relaxation, along with knowledge about basic yoga philosophy and a healthy lifestyle. A wonderful course for new beginners and those looking to deepen their practical experience of yoga.\nSome of the many benefits of yoga include: improvement in posture and breathing, increased strength and flexibility, a greater ability to cope with stress, and a feeling of peace and calm.\n\nMonday - Friday 6.30 - 7.30am\nStarts: 12 January 2026\n\nCost: 6 weeks| $171\nFor this course we require booking. 04-801 7012 or info@yogaindailylife.org.nz\n\nThere is no discount for this course. Possibility to join the course any time. We will practice each week a different part from the Level 1. If you could make just one or two weeks, you might like to buy a week pass for $54. Or feel free to contact us.",

Once your pieces are back, you will be taught how to cut, file and shape them into wearable pieces.\n\nLevel 1 students: Learn to work in both soft and hard jewellers' wax and send your waxes away to be cast. When they return, you will learn how to clean them up into finished jewellery and/or incorporate them into jewellery in multiple ways. We start with rings, but encourage students to think outside the box!\n\nLevel 2 students: Advance your carving skills and learn to set stones in your waxes. This can be done either by creating claws and other settings or trying the cast-in-place technique - an organic, exciting process.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are all your different types of waxes, sandpaper and courier costs.\n\nNot included are the casting and metal costs, which vary from student to student depending on what they want to make. Small castings can cost around $7 - $10, and metals are between $0.35 per gram for bronze - $4 per gram for silver. Please see details on our Regular Classes page.\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, PayPal or Afterpay on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time, please email us to arrange this ;)",

    "long_description": "The Book of Will, by playwright Lauren Gunderson, directed by Janet Noble, is a (mostly) faithful retelling of the true story of how Shakespeare's plays were almost lost to time.\n\nThis play opens several years after Shakespeare's death, as the surviving members of the King's Men realise that they are losing more and more of their company - and with them, the memory of all of the plays that made them. While Shakespeare published his sonnets during his lifetime, he never published his plays. Few playwrights did.\n\nShakespeare had started giving his actors only their lines, not the full play, so that it was harder for other theatre troupes to steal the work. A fire at the Globe Theatre after his death had destroyed many of the original full copies of the scripts. On top of that, unscrupulous printers had sent people to memorise as much of the popular plays as they could, then recount them so the printer could publish the play and claim copyright on it - even if the repeated version bore little resemblance to the actual play.\n\nTwo of Shakespeare's dearest friends, John Heminges and Henry Condell, set out to gather and publish all of the plays in their \"true and correct\" form. The result was the First Folio, without which we would have less than half of Shakespeare's plays in a corrupted version, the rest having been lost completely.\n\nBoth hilariously funny and poignant, this play is a love letter to theatre, a meditation on legacy and loss, and a celebration of the friends who ensured Shakespeare's words would survive.",

    "long_description": "Men's Circle: Authentic Relating\n\nIn a world where men are often expected to have everything figured out, this gathering offers a space to be genuine, not perfect.\n\nThis is a free event, with an optional plant-based dinner available for $15. While there\u2019s no obligation to stay for dinner, sharing a meal together offers a meaningful way to strengthen connections.\n\nAndre and Sri Jiva co-host this circle with a shared passion for creating authentic, supportive spaces where men can connect deeply\u2014offering this gathering simply because they believe in its importance.\n\nThe Men\u2019s Circle provides a safe and nurturing environment where men can share openly, express their feelings, and encourage personal growth\u2014free from societal pressures to be stoic or self-reliant. Through honest sharing and collective support, participants build resilience, deepen self-awareness, and strengthen their sense of identity and purpose.\n\nStructure of the Circle\n\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.\n\nA short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\n\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center. Only the person holding the object may speak, ensuring uninterrupted sharing.\n\nOpen Sharing: Anyone may choose to share while holding the object. Sharing is optional, and passing is always respected.\n\nActive Listening: While one person shares, others listen attentively without speaking, interrupting, or offering advice. The focus is on witnessing and being present.\n\nNo Judgments or Advice: Participants refrain from judging or offering unsolicited advice, creating a safe space for authentic expression.\n\nClosing: The circle may conclude with a group reflection, a moment of gratitude, or a simple acknowledgment of the shared experience.\n\nCircle Agreements\n\nSupportive Environment: We are here to uplift and support one another, fostering trust and brotherhood.\n\nFocus on the Present: Share what's alive for you now, focusing on your emotions and experiences to deepen emotional awareness.\n\nUse \"I\" Statements: Speak from your personal perspective using \"I\" statements to promote authenticity and responsibility. Avoid generalizations like \"we\" or \"us.\"\n\nNo Judgment or fixing: Refrain from judging others sharing or offering unsolicited advice, ensuring a safe and non-critical space.\n\nConfidentiality: What is shared in the circle stays in the circle. You may discuss your own experience outside the group, but keep others' details private.\n\nMeet Andre, your host\n\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.",

During her music studies at university, she was introduced to taonga p\u016boro, and this sparked a personal journey of reconnection to te ao M\u0101ori and her own whakapapa. Following university, she lived in an ashram for several years where she was introduced to the wonderful practice of bhakti yoga. She now lives with her husband in the Wellington region, where they regularly participate in kirtan (mantra music meditation) at Bhakti Lounge.\n\nAlexandra is a sound healing practitioner devoted to nurturing healing in both mind and body. She believes that sound vibration holds the power to expand consciousness and restore harmony and balance in our lives. Her journey into sound healing began with the realization of how deeply sound vibration was affecting her psyche\u2014making her more mindful of the music she listens to and the intention it carries. Along the way, she has drawn inspiration from artists such as Deva Premal, The Flying Mystics, Stevin McNamara, and the Bhakti Lounge Kirtan.

We are a community choir so all are welcome to come along and sing together.\n\nYou will be given some music to follow for the evening. We start with vocal warm-ups a small amount of stretching and some gentle movements to prepare for singing. Our talented Music Director Jonathan Berkahn directs us with our wonderful accompanist Philip O\u2019Malley on the piano.\n\nWe stop halfway through the evening for a drink and supper which is provided.\n\nIt\u2019s a great way to experience singing in a choir, especially if you haven\u2019t tried it before.\n\nWe welcome all levels of singing experience. Although having some music experience can be helpful it\u2019s not essential, as it can be learnt over time.\n\nWe offer four free practice sessions. If you miss one, just come to the next one when you can. After your four free sessions, you can decide whether you would like to join us as a member of our choir, Hutt City Chorale.\n\nWe hope you can come along and have an enjoyable evening singing with our choir.",

At its core is his unique, soulful voice and the punchy, heartfelt lyrics he wears on his sleeve.\n\nElly Mae crafts songs that encapsulate the bittersweet ache of growth, the quiet unraveling of time, and the soft glow of nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, indie, shoegaze, and anything in between. From lullabies that make you feel weightless to being wrapped in a blanket of sound, Elly Mae's folk/country melodic guitar style is accompanied by experimental, spatial bass from Arran Cargill-Brown and textured pocket drumming from Sasha Francis-Murray.",

Driven by groove and the desire to find meaning in the moments on this journey we call life, the musician, songwriter and producer has a signature sound that stands out and stuns. Fowles would describe his music as psychedelic soul laced with blues and funk. It resonates with deep grooves and driving rhythms created by vintage drum sounds, digital sonics, and electric guitars that build and blaze into billowing soundscapes. At its core is his unique, soulful voice and the punchy, heartfelt lyrics he wears on his sleeve.\n\nElly Mae crafts songs that encapsulate the bittersweet ache of growth, the quiet unraveling of time, and the soft glow of nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, indie, shoegaze, and anything in between. From lullabies that make you feel weightless to being wrapped in a blanket of sound, Elly Mae's folk/country melodic guitar style is accompanied by experimental, spatial bass from Arran Cargill-Brown and textured pocket drumming from Sasha Francis-Murray. \n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue. Minors are of course not allowed to purchase alcohol under any circumstance.",

The World War Two coastal battery first opened to the public in 1989 and will be accessible between 10am and 4pm.\n\nOn Waitangi Day people are invited to self-guide themselves through the tunnels and gun emplacements. The walk usually takes about one hour. Bring a torch with you for some fun! Strong footwear and no jandals!\n\nVisitors will be able to explore the 620 metres of underground tunnels with a free map and history pamphlet. They will see shell stores, plotting rooms and the huge gun pit where Gun umber 1 used to stand, as well as a replica of the 10-metre-long gun barrel. Also on show will be historic photos, and an assortment of military memorabilia. A DVD of how a 9.2-inch gun operates will be showing as well. The World War Two Fortress is the only one of its type in New Zealand available to the public on four Open Days a year.\n\nWrights Hill Fortress was built from 1942 to protect Wellington from Japanese bombardment. In the early 1960\u2019s, the guns were cut up for scrap and sold, ironically, to the Japanese.\n\nAdmission is $20 for a family of two adults and three children under 12, or $10 per adult and $5 per child. (CASH ONLY please-NO EFTPOS). Access is via Karori Road, Campbell Street, and Wrights Hill Road. All proceeds go to the continuing restoration of the Fortress. There is limited car parking at the summit of the Hill.\n\nVisitors to the Fortress in Wrights Hill Reserve can also enjoy bush walks, picnic sites and panoramic views from the top of the hill.\n\nThere will also be a BBQ sausage sizzle and soft drinks on sale. No booking required.\n\n",

    "long_description": "FOR IMMEDIATE USE \u2013 JAN / FEB 2026\nWAITANGI DAY\u2013 OPEN DAY\nFRIDAY 6TH FEB, 10AM- 4PM\nWellington\u2019s historic Wrights Hill Fortress in Karori will be open for public inspection again on Waitangi Day, Friday, February 6th. The World War Two coastal battery first opened to the public in 1989 and will be accessible between 10am and 4pm.\nOn Waitangi Day people are invited to self-guide themselves through the tunnels and gun emplacements. The walk usually takes about one hour. Bring a torch with you for some fun! Strong footwear and no jandals!\nVisitors will be able to explore the 620 metres of underground tunnels with a free map and history pamphlet. They will see shell stores, plotting rooms and the huge gun pit where Gun umber 1 used to stand, as well as a replica of the 10-metre-long gun barrel. Also on show will be historic photos, and an assortment of military memorabilia. A DVD of how a 9.2-inch gun operates will be showing as well. The World War Two Fortress is the only one of its type in New Zealand available to the public on four Open Days a year.\nWrights Hill Fortress was built from 1942 to protect Wellington from Japanese bombardment. In the early 1960\u2019s, the guns were cut up for scrap and sold, ironically, to the Japanese.\nAdmission is $20 for a family of two adults and three children under 12, or $10 per adult and $5 per child. (CASH ONLY please-NO EFTPOS). Access is via Karori Road, Campbell Street, and Wrights Hill Road. All proceeds go to the continuing restoration of the Fortress. There is limited car parking at the summit of the Hill.\nVisitors to the Fortress in Wrights Hill Reserve can also enjoy bush walks, picnic sites and panoramic views from the top of the hill.\nThere will also be a BBQ sausage sizzle and soft drinks on sale. No booking required. ",

    "long_description": "UNLEASH THE VOICES OF YOUR SUN AND MOON\nBook Soon for this special day workshop and explore and unleash the power of your Voice and Astrological Archetypes!!\n\nWe are blessed that Alignment Coach and Healer, Clare Babbage is visiting the Wellington Region from Napier, and collaborating with Voice Empowerment Coach and Healer, Bryony Rogers from Heartsong Healing, in this exciting, unique offering.\n\nThis workshop is a specially designed, transformative full day experience of Embodied Astrological Archetypes and Conscious Sound and Voice Practices.\n\nBOOK HERE - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nOn the date of the full moon, the energies of the sun and the moon stand face to face \u2014 illuminating both our outer expression and our inner world.\n\nIn astrology, the sun represents our fullest expression, our vitality, and the way we are here to shine. The moon reveals our emotional landscape, our inner rhythms, and often the fears that arise when we dare to live that full expression. Together, they form a powerful dialogue between structure and flow, logic and emotion, masculine and feminine.\n\nIn this workshop, Clare will guide you into an embodied exploration of your own sun and moon, inviting you to feel these two archetypes within your body and notice where they support, resist, or balance each other.\n\nBryony will lead you into vocal practices that bring these energies into sound and voice \u2014 giving expression to what is often left unspoken. Through voice, you\u2019ll release what holds you back and discover new harmony between your inner and outer selves.\n\nThis full moon is the perfect moment to unleash the voices of your sun and moon \u2014 and to step more fully into clarity, balance, and authentic expression.\n\nThe timing of this workshop gives you a unique opportunity to tune into these planets and benefit from their placement in the collective astrology.\n\nThe workshop will begin with the opportunity to explore powerful, enjoyable, accessible Voice Practices which open, align and strengthen your expression - and create physiological changes in your energy field.\n\nWe will then directly, bodily experience the energies of each of the Celestial Bodies through Embodied Astrology, guided by Clare.\n\nWe will integrate these energies, through further Voice Practices, including improvisation, healing chants and songs.\n\nThese two modalities will be carefully interwoven in an enjoyable, rich day's workshop that will benefit all participants.\n\nThere will be guided space in the workshop to integrate the energetic shifts and discoveries of both the Voice Practices and the Astrology.\n\nThis special workshop takes place on Saturday February 7th, 10am-4.30pm - we hope you can join us\n\nAt the Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Paraparaumu.\n\nINVESTMENT:\n\nYour investment for this day is $233. Shared lunch.\nSome concessions are available - please contact us by email .\n\nPayment by card here - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nPlease contact us with any questions at all.\n\n",

    "long_description": "What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

This new body of work will see McCall, with bandmates Rassani Tolovaa (Office Dog), Hamish Morgan (Marlin\u2019s Dreaming, School Fair), and Shaun Malloch (Mim Jensen), expand from the Pavement-esque tuneful indie rock of previous releases to include pedal steel, fiddle, drum machines, and synthesisers. While there is a diversity of style, the album is rooted in the hallmarks of McCall\u2019s music: uplifting and catchy guitar lines that serve the song, paired with arrangements that feel both comfortable and surprising.

The duo finds common ground between Clare Cooper\u2019s Chinese guhzeng and Jean-Philippe Gross\u2019 lo-fi microphones, electroacoustic devices and localized speaker system.\n\n\n\nStrasbourg\u2019s Jean-Philippe Gross will also perform a solo set, of electronic music using a dedicated feedback system.\nhttps://jeanphilippegross.com/\n\nClare Cooper is a musician and Design Lecturer from Sydney. Her work in creative community projects includes collaborative composition, speculative design, and critical listening. She co-founded the NOW now (2001), Splinter Orchestra (Sydney 2000), Splitter Orchester (Berlin 2009), and Frontyard Projects (2016).\n\nJean-Philippe Gross (Strasbourg \u2013 France) is a composer and improviser, performing with a dedicated feedback system often utilising multiple small speakers positioned around the performance space. In the studio, he continues his research with a \u201cSerge modular system\u201d.

    "long_description": "Scott Cook & Pamela Mae (CAN) at Abandoned Petone\nScott Cook and Pamela Mae - www.scottcook.net\n\nBorn in West Virginia and raised on the Canadian prairies, Scott Cook quit a job teaching kindergarten in Taiwan in 2007 to embark on the life of a full-time troubadour. He\u2019s toured nearly nonstop across Canada, the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere ever since, living out of backpacks and campervans, averaging over a hundred shows and a dozen summer festivals a year, and distilling his experiences into empathetic, keenly observant verse.

    "long_description": "This is another opportunity to explore charming Greytown houses and gardens where the owners have valued and enhanced the integrity of the building and its environment, and so nurtured Greytown's heritage.\n\nGreytown Heritage Trust offers this self-guided tour, unveiling nine remarkable properties along with three destination events. A newly opened countryside caf\u00e9, spoiling with on-site baking, offers a pause looking out towards the Tararua range. A barbecue in a bucolic Waiohine setting. A f\u00eate, nostalgically redolent of yesteryear, selling perennials, crafts and home produce. There will be Devonshire cream teas and Wairarapa Ros\u00e9 and bubbly, bunting, adventure and indulgence. How could you resist?\nThe houses are further flung than the previous tour and we listened hard to feedback \u2013 fewer destinations but greater distances will mean you\u2019ll more comfortably explore this charming town and it\u2019s houses and gardens.\nYou\u2019re invited to spend a summer\u2019s day exploring remarkable houses and gardens in this attractive town. In so doing you will contribute to a fundraiser for the refurbishment of Greytown's colonial-settler K\u014duka Cottage (c1860) at Stella Bull Park, 113 Main Street, Greytown. This cottage and its maintenance are important in fostering Greytown's architectural heritage.\nReceive with your ticket:\nAccess to 9 of Greytown\u2019s significant private homes & gardens. Access to a f\u00eate, a caf\u00e9 and a countryside barbecue.\nA quality keepsake folding map & information poster. These will be posted to you nearer to the date.\n\nGeneral information & conditions\nProperties are open from 10.00am until 4.30pm. This tour is self-guided; you can visit the properties in any order you wish.\nEach ticket holder will be sent a map and wristbands for entry, by post. It is absolutely critical that you include your address on your Eventfinda registration and purchase of tickets.\nAt each venue you\u2019re asked to present your wristband to the volunteers at the entrance to gain access. Please ensure that you are wearing your wristband during the tour as this will ensure your entry at each address. The wristband isn't transferable to other people during the tour events.\nThe houses, of course, are private homes. Photographs are available on the Greytown Heritage Trust\u2019s media sites and we ask that you don\u2019t take your own photographs inside houses, nor touch furnishings or items. Some areas will be inaccessible and signed accordingly. Some gardens may also be off limits for photography but this will be indicated at the venue.\nKeeping people and property safe is important, this tour is reserved for those aged over 15. We\u2019re also asking that no animals are brought to the visits unless they are mobility-trained and certified. Accessibility is compromised variously in houses and some gardens.\nGreytown public toilets will be marked on the map.\nThe tour will proceed regardless of rain or other moderately poor weather but there may be a cancellation in the event of Met Office amber or red warnings. In this, what we hope is unlikely, event we will communicate with you by email and on social media sites.\nCash sales and some eftpos facilities will be available at some properties. The proceeds or proportions of these sales will also contribute to the fundraiser.\nThe Trust is grateful for your support, and wish you a wonderful day exploring and enjoying Greytown\u2019s heritage properties.\nLinks\nWebsite (for more heritage info):\nhttps://www.greytownheritagetrust.co.nz/\nSocial Media (for sneak peaks of the tour):\nhttps://www.instagram.com/greytownheritagetrust/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/greytownheritagetrust",

    "long_description": "On the 12 February 1909, the SS Penguin sank in Cook Strait in a raging southerly storm with the loss of 72 lives, one of the worst maritime disasters in NZ history.  Many of those who died were woman and children, as their lifeboats capsized in the wild sea. \nAlthough the Captain was heavily criticised, it is still not clear what the ship hit nor where, as the wreck of the Penguin has never been located. \nThe tragedy stunned Wellington and a day of mourning was called for 16 February.  The city came to a standstill as many of those who died were brought up to Karori Cemetery for burial in a long procession of cabs and lorries.\nTo commemorate this tragedy the Friends will be undertaking a guided tour of most of the Penguin graves on Sunday 8th February. \nThe tour duration is approximately 2 hours long.\nThis tour is suitable for people with moderate fitness. The route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. Surefootedness is required.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee). Children under 12 are free.\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nNote:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you one hour before the tour start time by email and on our Facebook page. The booking fee is non-refundable.\nPlease dress appropriately for the conditions. While we do our best to guide you on a safe walking route, during the winter months the ground can become slippery in places.\nSome of our walks require a moderate degree of fitness and are not suited for those with limited mobility.

So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2026. We'll giveaway any spots remaining on the Friday before each Workout, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email poproximprov@gmail.com and we'll pop you on the SBL. Everyone on the list will be notified whether there was a place available for them 2 days before the relevant workshop. ",

He\u2019s toured nearly nonstop across Canada, the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere ever since, living out of backpacks and campervans, averaging over a hundred shows and a dozen summer festivals a year, and distilling his experiences into empathetic, keenly observant verse. Since 2022 he\u2019s been joined full-time by his sweetheart Pamela Mae on upright bass and vocals, crisscrossing 45 US States and 8 Canadian provinces in their campervan Roadetta, and covering a fair bit of Australia in their HiAce Hector. In 2026 they\u2019re bringing the duo project to New Zealand for the first time with an extensive tour of the North and South Islands in support of Cook's eighth album Troubadourly Yours. Fresh from the open road, these are sturdy, straight-talking songs that see the good in you.\n\n\u201cWhip-smart, bone-achingly lovely, socially committed songs presented with a bold, elegant directness evoking the very best of the folk music tradition.

I\u2019m a sometimes writer, sometimes potter and sometimes painter, based in beautiful P\u014dneke with my three cats.\nVincents has enabled me to explore ceramics for three years now, and I\u2019ve been painting and drawing since I was a child. Often when I\u2019ve experienced big feelings, large life events or stressful situations, I\u2019ve turned to paints or clay.\nI enjoy the \u2018analog\u2019 way of working with ceramics and paints - you\u2019re not using a screen or technology, it\u2019s just you and your grubby hands.\nI also like the slow and imperfect process this involves - making things that are one-off, wonky, weird but human.\nMy subject matters are generally humans; scenes based on the mundane, the domestic.\nA woman on a chair in a room / Lovers in bed / A colour that reminds me of a feeling.\nI\u2019m interested in people and our relationships with one another, and what occupies our little brains and hearts.\nComing home\nThis exhibition, Coming home, is the product of many years of being tucked away and working through various stages of love, heartache, loneliness and happiness in the safety of differentiating rooms I called home.\nComing home to loved ones, whether they be friends or pets, is my favourite feeling in the world.\nHome for me is the place to be completely oneself, un-mask and breathe.\nIn saying this, home hasn\u2019t always been a physical space; for me it\u2019s been a person, a feeling, and something carried inside.\nI hope you enjoy these works.\n",

Life inevitably presents us with challenges, complexities, and difficulties. Our sense of self and identity can either empower us, helping us navigate these challenges with resilience, or disempower us, leading to confusion, hopelessness, or depression.\n\nIn the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, readers are encouraged to deeply contemplate the true self\u2014our consciousness. By exploring life through this understanding, we can cultivate a greater sense of meaning and connection with the world, our loved ones, and everything around us.\n\n\nHosted by Sri Jiva and Smita:\n\nFrom a young age, Smita was drawn to music as a means for reflection and self-expression. Following university, she lived in an ashram for several years, where she was introduced to the wonderful practice of bhakti yoga and its wisdom. Inspired by her practice, she regularly hosts kirtan (mantra music meditation) sessions at Bhakti Lounge along with her husband Sri Jiva.\n\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\n6.15pm Tuesday 10th February\n\nEnd the session on a high note with a delicious plant-based dinner, dessert, and good conversation.",

    "long_description": "Christoph Gallio / Phil Durrant\nPhil Durrant (electric mandolin and electronics) and Christoph Gallio (saxophones) are veterans of the international free improvisation scene. Their individual and collaborative projects have helped shape the development of improvised music. They first worked together over 40 years ago, but it wasn\u2019t until 2022 that they started performing as a duo. It is rare that improvisors of their calibre make it out to NZ, so we\u2019re very happy to host them at Pyramid Club for a duo concert plus collaborative sets with local musicians.\n\nPhil Durrant (London, UK) is a multi-instrumentalist improviser, composer and sound artist. As a violinist he was one of the key exponents of the \u2018group voice approach\u2019 style of improvised music, performing as a member of the Butcher/Russell/Durrant trio, News From The Shed and the Chris Burn Ensemble. In the late 90s, his influential trio with Radu Malfatti and Thomas Lehn represented a shift to a more reductionist approach. As a synthesiser player, Durrant performs with Bertrand Denzler and Burkhard Beins in Trio Sowari. He is also a member of the international electronic ensemble MIMEO with Keith Rowe, Kaffe Matthews, Thomas Lehn and Rafael Toral. He has performed all over Europe and Canada and released CDs and records on Acta and Emanem Records.\n\nSwiss saxophonist and composer Christoph Gallio studied classical saxophone with Iwan Roth at the Basel Music Conservator and then with Steve Lacy in Paris. He has collaborated with many of the world\u2019s leading voices in improvisation including Irene Schweizer, Urs Blo\u0308chlinger, Mani Neumeier, Peter Kowald, Fred Frith, Haco, Tetsu Saitoh, Phil Minton, Pablo Diaz, Marcelo von Schultz, Olie Brice, Andrew Lisle, Cath Roberts, Irene Aebi, William Parker, Rashied Ali, Matthew Ostrowski, Gerry Hemingway, Sven-A\u030ake Johansson, Olaf Rupp, Jan Roder, Oli Steidle, Andrea Neumann, Ernst Thoma, Julian Sartorius, Nicolas Stocker, Paula Shocron, Sergio Merce, Alistair Zaldua, Phil Durrant, Roger Turner, Dominic Lash, Mark Sanders and many more. Gallio has been running his own label PERCASO since 1986.\n\nwww.gallio.ch\n\nDurrant and Gallio will perform a duo set, and then be joined by local improvising musicians Tom Callwood (bass), Jake Baxendale (sax) and Daniel Beban (guitar/tapes).\n\nTheir tour is sponsored by Swiss Arts Council, Aargauer Kuratorium, City of Baden, SIS (Schweizerische Interpreten Stiftung) and Fondation SUISA.\n\n\n$20 presale tickets via UTR\n$35 donation tickets\n$15 unwaged door sales\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

The inability to anticipate exactly what the paint will do makes watercolour an exciting medium to work with.\n\nIn this course we will learn to set the conditions for surprising and beautiful accidents to occur on the page. By incorporating these looser abstract elements into representational paintings we can convey heightened emotions in our work.\n\nThroughout the term we will cover the following:\n\n- The wet into wet technique to achieve one of a kind paint interactions.\n- Learn about transparent colour mixing to create luminosity in your paintings.\n- Use marbling to find organic shapes and patterns.\n- Study the relationship between line and colour and the different ways they can be combined to find a personal style.\n- Experiment with composition through collage.\n\nEach class we will look at examples of historic and contemporary painting, and discuss how to selectively incorporate references into your work. Over the term you will build up a visual style and body of work.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new to watercolour or looking to expand your range, this course offers an opportunity to explore the expressive potential of watercolour.\n\nBasic materials included. Students must be at least 16 years of age to attend this course.\n\nEight week courses running on:\n- Wednesdays, 11 Feb - 1 April, 10-12pm\n- Thursdays, 12 Feb - 2 April, 6-8pm",

    "long_description": "We are starting the publishing year with a major double book launch! Join us to launch two stunning new poetry collections by Bill Manhire and Jenny Bornholdt.\nWednesday 11 February, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nAll welcome!\nBill Manhire's Lyrical Ballads and Jenny Bornholdt's What to Wear arrive together from two of New Zealand's most celebrated poets, both former poet laureates. The books will be launched by Robyn Marsack, a Wellington-born editor, translator and literary advocate, and former Director of the Scottish Poetry Library.\n\nLyrical Ballads by Bill Manhire is a dazzling new collection from New Zealand's inaugral poet laureate.\nBill Manhire observes the collisions between wonder and reality, childhood vulnerability and ageing, and hilarity and heartbreak.\nLyrical Ballads is a many-peopled book: the baffled inhabitants of Every Street and Intermediate Street are here, while Dracula, T.S. Eliot and Bobby Outram from Outram have walk-on parts. The collection is anchored by two long sequences that embrace awkwardness, mystery and absurdity: 'The Tobacco Tin' and 'Tell You What'.\n\nWhat to Wear is a beautiful new collection by Jenny Bornholdt, one of Aotearoa's most-loved poets and a former poet laureate.\nThe poems in What to Wear observe that life means doing ordinary and marvellous things \u2013 like going to Bunnings, falling asleep on the train, losing and finding poems, losing and dreaming of our mothers, loving, dying, and deciding what to wear.\nBornholdt's poems turn to the universal subjects of mortality, memory, ageing and grief, but always with lightness, humanity and wry humour.\n\nThe cover of Lyrical Ballads is by Todd Atticus\nThe cover photograph for What to Wear is by Deborah Smith\nThe cover design for What to Wear is by Dexter Murray ",

    "long_description": "In this course, you will examine structural drawing with a careful, helpful approach, focusing on simple perspective drawing and the value of geometric shapes and solids. Both these structural approaches contribute greatly to the success of your drawing.\n\nGeometric shapes can simplify a subject, unify a drawing and make compositions dynamic. Geometric solids will help render any subject in three dimensions and transition to perspective.\n\nA good working knowledge of the concepts of perspective will help you draw any subject with correct dimensionality. It can also help in your realistic drawing, painting and invented subjects and environments. These concepts are also used in most two-dimensional art because it enables us to realise great spatial effects, making it an invaluable tool to add to your skill set.\n\nIn this course, you will learn the following:\n\n- Focus on geometric shapes and solids and how they contribute to both realist and abstract drawing\n- Form an appreciation of geometry and shapes that can help with constructing a drawing\n- The important tools, methods and concepts of one-point, two-point and three-point perspectives\n- Universal boxing, drawing ellipses\n- Hints in locating helpful lines and axes to draw real subjects\n- Introductory methods of working that blend perspective knowledge with real drawing situations\n\nAll basic materials supplied.\n\nYou must be at least 16 years of age to attend this course.\n\nAn eight-week course running on either:\n- Wednesdays, 11 Feb - 1 April, 6:30-8:30\n- Fridays, 13 Feb - 10 April, 10am-1pm",

    "long_description": "Phil Durrant (electric mandolin and electronics) and Christoph Gallio (saxophones) are veterans of the international free improvisation scene. Their individual and collaborative projects have helped shape the development of improvised music. They first worked together over 40 years ago, but it wasn\u2019t until 2022 that they started performing as a duo. It is rare that improvisors of their calibre make it out to NZ, so we\u2019re very happy to host them at Pyramid Club for a duo concert plus collaborative sets with local musicians.\nPhil Durrant (London, UK) is a multi-instrumentalist improviser, composer and sound artist. As a violinist he was one of the key exponents of the \u2018group voice approach\u2019 style of improvised music, performing as a member of the Butcher/Russell/Durrant trio, News From The Shed and the Chris Burn Ensemble. In the late 90s, his influential trio with Radu Malfatti and Thomas Lehn represented a shift to a more reductionist approach. As a synthesiser player, Durrant performs with Bertrand Denzler and Burkhard Beins in Trio Sowari. He is also a member of the international electronic ensemble MIMEO with Keith Rowe, Kaffe Matthews, Thomas Lehn and Rafael Toral. He has performed all over Europe and Canada and released CDs and records on Acta and Emanem Records.\nSwiss saxophonist and composer Christoph Gallio studied classical saxophone with Iwan Roth at the Basel Music Conservator and then with Steve Lacy in Paris. He has collaborated with many of the world\u2019s leading voices in improvisation including Irene Schweizer, Urs Blo\u0308chlinger, Mani Neumeier, Peter Kowald, Fred Frith, Haco, Tetsu Saitoh, Phil Minton, Pablo Diaz, Marcelo von Schultz, Olie Brice, Andrew Lisle, Cath Roberts, Irene Aebi, William Parker, Rashied Ali, Matthew Ostrowski, Gerry Hemingway, Sven-A\u030ake Johansson, Olaf Rupp, Jan Roder, Oli Steidle, Andrea Neumann, Ernst Thoma, Julian Sartorius, Nicolas Stocker, Paula Shocron, Sergio Merce, Alistair Zaldua, Phil Durrant, Roger Turner, Dominic Lash, Mark Sanders and many more. Gallio has been running his own label PERCASO since 1986.\nwww.gallio.ch\nDurrant and Gallio will perform a duo set, and then be joined by local improvising musicians Tom Callwood (bass), Jake Baxendale (sax) and Daniel Beban (guitar/tapes).\nTheir tour is sponsored by Swiss Arts Council, Aargauer Kuratorium, City of Baden, SIS (Schweizerische Interpreten Stiftung) and Fondation SUISA.\n\n$20 presale tickets via UTR\n$35 donation tickets\n$15 unwaged door sales\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme ",

    "long_description": "Rethinking Career: Find the Work You\u2019re Meant For\n\nFor many people, work feels heavy.\nSomething to get through. Something that drains more than it gives.\n\nYou might feel bored, frustrated, stuck, or quietly miserable \u2014 but also unsure what to do about it. Changing jobs can feel overwhelming. Will it actually make things better? Will it be worth the risk? Will I still feel financially safe?\n\nThis evening is not about rushing into big decisions.\nIt\u2019s about understanding yourself first.\n\nDrawing on the Career Dharma framework, this event offers a different way of looking at work - one based on human nature, psychology, and timeless wisdom. It starts from a simple but often overlooked idea: we are not all nourished by the same things.\n\nIn Career Dharma, enrichment is understood as wealth - not only financial, but emotional, creative, intellectual, relational, and spiritual. Each of us is sustained by different kinds of wealth. These are known as our prosperity types.\n\nWhen our work provides the kinds of prosperity our body and mind actually need, work feels lighter, more meaningful, and more sustainable. When it doesn\u2019t, even a \u201cgood\u201d or stable job can slowly drain us.\n\nThrough guided reflection and practical exercises, you\u2019ll begin to uncover:\n\nWhat genuinely makes you feel fulfilled and energized at work\n\nThe types of prosperity that matter most to you\n\nWhy certain work environments exhaust you - and others don\u2019t\n\nHow greater self-understanding can help you adjust your current role or make wiser choices about future work\n\nThis session isn\u2019t about job titles or quick fixes. It\u2019s about awareness - and how knowing what truly nourishes you can change the way you relate to work, without needing to have all the answers yet.\n\nPlease note this is one of two careers workshops this month. While they complement each other, each session is designed to be meaningful on its own.\n\nA plant-based dinner and dessert are included in your ticket.\nBoth hosts are available to support those who wish to continue exploring their career path.\n\nMeet your hosts, Sri Jiva & Chanchala\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\nChanchala studied psychology and education and brings a coaching-based approach to career exploration. She supports people to uncover work they love by helping them understand what truly nourishes their nature and psychology. Chanchala\u2019s work is grounded in curiosity, self-trust, and creating careers that feel sustainable and life-giving.",

    "long_description": "Tipping Points in the Cryosphere\nPublic panel discussion featuring world leaders in cryospheric sciences as part of the international 'Climate in the Crysophere' conference\n\nAbout this Event\n\nThe accelerating loss of the cryosphere, which holds 70% of the world\u2019s freshwater in all its forms \u2013 sea ice, lake ice, mountain glaciers, the polar ice sheets and their ice shelves, snow and permafrost - is one of the clearest planet-wide consequences of global warming so far.\nThe loss of even parts of these key components of the cryosphere would result in severe impacts for coastal communities, infrastructure and ecosystems through permanent inundation of the lowest-lying areas and by increasing the frequency of flooding, and requires an extensive and long-term commitment to adaptation to limit these impacts. By the end of the century one billion people living in coastal areas could be impacted (IPCC 2023).\nThere is ample evidence for abrupt change in the past, especially for the glaciers and ice sheets. Moreover, changes in land-ice are, for the most part, are irreversible on human-to-glacial timescales. In fact, both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets show strong hysteresis behaviour, meaning that once certain parts of the ice sheets are gone, it would take much colder temperatures to regain the ice.\nWhat characterises tipping dynamics in the cryosphere most, however, are the nested timescales, and possibility of tipping cascades between elements, ranging from mere hours-decades in the sea-ice, up to millennia for the ice sheets with consequences on a range of spatial scales: as global warming accelerates, there is an increasing discrepancy between the rapid forcing, and the comparably long response times in the cryosphere. This clash in timescales gives rise to a massive gap between the observed and committed impacts, in particular when it comes to sea-level rise. While typical projections focus on sea-level changes within this century, recent evidence suggests that the bulk of sea-level rise - even while triggered within this century - will unfold over hundreds, if not thousands of years.\n\n",

Reflecting on that era, Nic Cester said, \u201cGet Born was a rare and unique moment of total planetary alignment where we somehow managed to capture lightning in a bottle.\u201d\n\nTheir enduring legacy was officially recognised in November 2023, when they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.\n\nThis February see Jet live \u2013 raw, loud, and full of the spirit that made them international rock legends.",

    "long_description": "Authentic Dating Wellington\n\u201cThank you so much for creating a space in which such well-aligned people could come together. I can't think of the last time I met so many wonderful, open-minded people in one go like that. It was a real pleasure\u201d - John\n\n\nTired of endless scrolling?\n\n\nOver the superficiality of app culture?\n\n\nReady to connect with real people and talk about what truly matters?\n\n\nHere\u2019s your chance take a break from the apps and connect more openly and authentically with those both like-minded and different. After a long break, it's returning to Wellington this February for Valentine's weekend!\n\n\nYou\u2019ll have several encounters throughout the night. Each will be carefully guided, inviting you to be yourself, to communicate openly, and and explore multiples layers and flavours of connection. Come spark a new summer flame! \ud83d\udd25\n\n\nAuthentic Dating welcomes all men, women & non-binary people aged 18+, both monogamous & non-monogamous. We will aim to pair you with a gender different from your own.\n\n\nIs this event for me?\n\nIf you are seeking....\n\n\u2728 Deep & meaningful conversations without small talky chit-chat\n\n\u2728 Exciting new connections, both romantic & platonic\n\n\u2728 An opportunity to explore & challenge your assumptions\n\n\u2728 A substance-free environment\n\n\u2728 Playful & sincere communication activities\n\n\u2728 Skills you can apply to your dating life beyond the event\n\n\u2728 A space to simply be yourself\n\n....then this event is for you!\n\n\nWhat will actually happen? \ud83e\udd70\n\nYou will be invited to explore four unique interactions, some of which are randomised and some of which you can choose. Each will involve a new set of instructions to help you communicate about topics that really matter to you.\n\nEach interaction will last 10-15 minutes. At the end of each interaction, you will have the opportunity to share a contact detail on a piece of paper in a way that is both cute and discrete ~ please bring your own pen!\n\nConsent is important: you always have the agency to choose how deep you go. You will never be forced to share information that you don't want to.\n\n\nWhy are tickets sold by gender? \ud83d\udc6b\n\nTo ensure that the gender balance is as even as possible, it is important to keep track of how many men/women/non-binary people are signing up. If a particular gender is over-represented in the run-up to the event, we do our best to ensure that under-represented gender(s) also sign up.\n\nWhile we aim to achieve an even balance of genders (and ages), this is not always possible. However, what is guaranteed are skills that you can apply to any connection. Simply come with an open mind and ready to connect.\n\n\nThe facilitator \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nLaurie King\n\nI'm Laurie (he/him), a queer British-Kiwi who\u2019s current home-base is Berlin. My passion is creating spaces that cultivate healthy, thriving human-to-human relationships, helping people take off their masks, feel their sensations and celebrate their aliveness on Earth. Since 2019, I have organised and facilitated hundreds of Authentic Relating, Dating and Embodiment workshops in Oceania and Europe.\n\nMy training includes The Embody Lab, Authentic Revolution, Body Electric, Connection Institute and World Peace Yoga School. I have facilitated at internationally acclaimed festivals such as Stretch and Ignite, and organisations such as ART International and Authentic Bay Area.\n\nMy workshops have sparked thousands of nourishing connections, turning many strangers into life-long friends. I look forward to holding space for you!\n\nI also offer online Holistic Coaching sessions, inspired by Authentic Relating, Positive Intelligence and Somatic Experiencing techniques.\n\n\nFor more information, check out itoiauthenticrelating.com.\n\n\nFor my Instagram, check out @itoiauthentic.\n\n\ni to i Authentic Dating has already been a big hit in Wellington, as well as Auckland, Christchurch, Berlin, Amsterdam, Melbourne, Sydney, Vienna, Copenhagen, London, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Montreal.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what others have said:\n\n\n\"This has been the most positive experience I've had in meeting genuine souls with the intention of finding love/romance for over 6 years\" - Luca\n\n\n\"Laurie led us through a series of games and exercises that allowed us to open up and create very real bonds with others and with our own selves. Many emotions were felt in the safest, most welcoming environment\" - Jason\n\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful workshop you ran last night. I walked away with a sense of renewed self worth and also questioned why I don\u2019t articulate comfortably what I want. It\u2019s the perfect antidote to app culture.\u201d - Imogen\n\n\n\u201cLaurie created a beautiful, safe space in no time, making it an ideal environment to be present and engage meaningfully with the activities. Even though all participants were strangers to me, I felt a deep sense of belonging developing over the evening.\u201d - Tim\n\n\n\u201cThank you so much for creating a space in which such well-aligned people could come together. I can't think of the last time I met so many wonderful, open-minded people in one go like that. It was a real pleasure\u201d - John\n\n\n\"I love Laurie\u2019s energy, wisdom, execution and light touch. I felt super safe to open up and connect while he was holding the space\" - Tess\n\n\n\"Authentic Dating re-opened an old window for me in a new way. Heaps of fun too! And I did meet a very special person. Highly recommend for anyone curious and keen to connect with depth & joy\" - Samantha\n\n\nPracticalities:\n\nCost:\n\n$35 for Low income\n\n$45 for Regular income\n\n$55 for High income\n\n*\n\nLocation: Wellington Meditation Centre, 31 Hobson Crescent, Thorndon, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.\n\nWhen: Friday 13th February, 7.30 - 10pm.

This is an excellent opportunity to treat yourself to some creative fun on a Friday night!\n\nIn weeks one and two, you will learn how to work with jeweller's hard wax to create beautiful textures in metal that can be used to create amazing rings or objects. Your waxes will be sent away for casting in the metal of your choice.\n\nThen there will be a week's break before the third session, to allow time for everyone's waxes to be cast. The third session covers how to trim, clean and finish your casts, turning them into original jewellery ready to wear!\n\nMore advanced students can use these sessions to complete projects in a class setting.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are all your different types of waxes, sandpaper and courier costs.\n\nNot included are the casting and metal costs which vary from student to student depending on what sized ring they want to make and the type of metal you choose. Small castings can cost around $6.65 - $12 and might cost between $7 to $30 in metals depending on if you use red bronze, white bronze or silver.\n\nThis class is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.",

Later in the year, a piece of a SpaceX Starlink satellite was found in a lentil field in another part of the province. In September 2025, one of the handful of Starlink satellites reentering every week was witnessed burning up across the entire western half of Canada, with the reentry ending over Saskatchewan.\nDr. Samantha Lawler of the University of Regina has been studying the proliferation of satellites in orbit over the past few years, and has been stunned to learn how often space debris falls so close to her home. Come learn why Saskatchewan is the best place in the world to find space debris, and what happens when you find space debris on your farm and silent SpaceX employees show up in a rented truck to be greeted by an astronomer and a dozen of Saskatchewan's finest local journalists. The billionaire space race is well underway, and this has important implications for international law, the continued operation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit, atmospheric pollution, and the future of astronomy.\nSamantha Lawler is a professor of astronomy at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada. She completed degrees at the California Institute of Technology, Wesleyan University, and the University of British Columbia, followed by postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Victoria (Canada) and NRC-Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre. Her discoveries in the Kuiper Belt and predictions for satellite pollution have been featured by BBC, CBC, CNN, NPR, BBC, Scientific American, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Wired Magazine, Nature, and many other international news outlets. She lives on a farm outside Regina and deeply appreciates the beautiful prairie skies.\n#nziauastronomy NZ IAU Astronomy Outreach\nIAU Office for Astronomy Outreach\nRASNZ\n",

After a long break, it's returning to Wellington this February for Valentine's weekend!\n\nYou\u2019ll have several encounters throughout the night.

Many emotions were felt in the safest, most welcoming environment\" - Jason\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful workshop you ran last night. I walked away with a sense of renewed self worth and also questioned why I don\u2019t articulate comfortably what I want.

GLM\u2019s cutting edge sonics have received radio support on networks like BBC Radio 1, Kiss FM, and Rinse FM, and he has performed widely across club circuits in the UK. A true don on the tools, we\u2019re excited to welcome him as he showcases his production sound at Valhalla.\nOn support, we have an all-star lineup including TEXTURE, joining us from Otautahi for the first time since 2021.\nWe\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to bring Texture up for a while, and this felt like a perfect opportunity. A purveyor of a unique sound that elicits an emotional response, fusing elements of bass, breakbeat, jungle and techno, Texture is high quality and well-seasoned, having opened for some serious artists including Addison Groove, Machinedrum, Ben UFO and Alix Perez. We can\u2019t wait to host her for the first time this February!\nFrom the local sphere, we\u2019ve pulled out the big guns.\nOn opening duties we have NOYER, a man we can always trust to get the floor rocking. One half of Garage Sale, Noyer has been a staple of the capital\u2019s underground dance music scene for the whole of the 2020s.\nTo close out the night in style, we\u2019ve got a blockbuster back to back of two of the capital\u2019s finest jungle selectors - WHAEA G & OHIMESAMA BREAKS.

Whilst RateYourMusic users described the album as \u201chedonistic, energetic, vulgar, rhythmic, urban, and heavy,\u201d capturing the raw essence of its sound and attitude. With over 450,000 copies sold worldwide, Broke remains a defining moment in the nu-metal era and this tour is your chance to relive it live.\n\nExpect pounding riffs, funk-infused grooves, and the unmistakable flow of frontman Jahred Gomes, whose stage presence turns every show into a riotous celebration of rebellion and rhythm. From their self-titled debut in 1997 to their latest release New and Improved, (HED) P.E. continues to evolve while staying true to their anti-establishment roots.\n\nDebuting in New Zealand for the first time and with an incredible career spanning nearly three decades, Nonpoint has long been a force to be reckoned with in the nu-metal/rap-rock genre. Known for legendary live performances and explosive tracks such as Bullet with a Name, What a Day, Ruthless, and more, the band has consistently captivated audiences with infectious riffs, compelling lyrics, and an uncompromising raw energy.

    "long_description": "\"The experience and the venue were very restorative for my nervous system. Connectivity through a delicious winding path of interactive games and movement expression experiences lead me to a very open and receptive creative space. Highly recommend. Amazing facilitation.\" - Lily\n\u201cThanks to this workshop, I was able to let go more than ever before, and really let in touch that was non-sexual, loving, and supportive. Thank you so much for offering another step up the mountain of growth & healing\u201d - Amanda\n*****\nImagine a day where you can drop deeply into embodied awareness, show up authentically with other heart-centred humans, and get straight to the core of what truly matters, through connective somatic practices designed to nourish your body & replenish your spirit.\nWelcome to Somatic Sanctuary, a full-day experience where you are invited to self-regulate & co-regulate through a range of complementary modalities: Yin Yoga, Authentic Relating & Contact Improvisation.\nThis February, you are invited to The Wellington Meditation Centre, a beautiful & cosy urban sanctuary complete with a tranquil garden. Come explore the many layers of yourself and others through a journey of deep yet playful communication and contact games.\nAfter taking this precious day for yourself, you are likely to step into the week ahead with a profound sense of well-being, a remarkable connection to your body and an experiential toolkit that you can use right away to make your everyday life even better.\nWHO is this day for?\nIn essence, Somatic Sanctuary is for you if you want to connect on a deeper level with your body, your desires, your boundaries, your emotional reality, your empathy skills and your ability to feel compassion for yourself. This day will enhance your interpersonal relationships and enrich your self love within.\nWhether you are a seasoned workshop/retreat goer or it\u2019s your first time ever exploring the bespoke practices, you are sure to get something valuable out of this workshop.\nYou are also most welcome if you\u2019ve been recently feeling blocked, anxious, lacking purpose or direction, and need to reground and remind yourself what's truly important and who you truly are.\nOur experience includes working with Highly Sensitive People (HSPs); neurodiverse people; people suffering from anxiety and depression; people going through major life shifts; and members of the LGBTQ+ community.\nIf you have any questions about whether the event would suit you, pop us a message and we\u2019ll get back to you within 24 hours.\nWHAT will actually happen?\nActivities will explore movement, conversation and physical contact, through the modalities of Yin Yoga, Authentic Relating & Contact Improvisation.\nYin Yoga focuses on deeply relaxing the nervous system, by bringing fresh life force (prana) to your connective tissue and vital organs. Through deep stretches, long holds, and mindful breathing, your body is given permission to fully release any tension that has accumulated over time.\nAuthentic Relating is a ground breaking social tool that invites you to courageously step into open hearted connection, through radical honesty and active listening. The practice invites you to drop deeper into presence, embodied awareness and permission to express whatever is alive within you and the \u2018we-space\u2019 between you and other(s), as well as any boundaries that emerge within the connection field.\nContact Improvisation is a dance form that emphasises both self-regulation and co-regulation, through spontaneous movement and physical connection between people, as well as the non-human physical space (such as the floor). It encourages exploration of balance, weight-sharing, and communication through touch, inducing a deeply aware state of surrendered fluidity.\nConsent will be emphasised throughout the weekend. You will continually be reminded to listen to your body and only do what is within your personal boundaries. While you will be encouraged to stretch yourself and widen your window of tolerance, you will practice identifying your stress zone and will learn tools to help you self-regulate if you push yourself too far.\nThere will also be a support team on hand if you need to co-regulate at any point.\nWHERE will it be?\nThe workshop will take place at Wellington Meditation Centre, 31 Hobson Crescent, Thorndon, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.\nThe FACILITATORS\nLaurie King\nLaurie (he/him), is a queer British-Kiwi who\u2019s current home-base is Wellington, NZ. His passion is creating spaces that cultivate healthy, thriving human-to-human relationships, helping people take off their masks, feel their sensations and celebrate their aliveness on Earth. Since 2019, he has organised and facilitated hundreds of Authentic Relating, Dating and Embodiment workshops in Oceania and Europe.\nHis training includes The Embody Lab, Authentic Revolution, Connection Institute, Body Electric and World Peace Yoga School. He has facilitated at internationally acclaimed festivals such as Stretch and Ignite, and organisations such as ART International and Authentic Bay Area.\nHis workshops have sparked thousands of nourishing connections, turning many strangers into life-long friends. He looks forward to holding space for you!\nFor more information, check out itoiauthenticrelating.com.\nLaurie\u2019s workshops have already touched & impacted many lives. Here's what others have shared:\n\u201cThis was a game changer for me. I'm blown away on a daily basis as to how easy communicating and relating has been since doing Laurie's incredible workshop\" - Andy\n\"I live with complex PTSD and anxiety so in the past I have really struggled to open up to people and build meaningful connections. Discovering these workshops has been a life changer and both my therapist and I are thrilled with how my confidence has blossomed in recent months. Laurie's time and generosity really means the world to me\" - Sarah\n\u201cLaurie created a beautiful, safe space in no time! making it an ideal environment to be present and engage meaningfully with the activities. Even though all participants were strangers to me, I felt a deep sense of belonging developing over the day.\u201d - Julie\n\u201cThe exercises allowed me to center myself in heartspace - free to be held by others in love and in my own experience while also able to hold them in their experience. As such, it\u2019s a perfect space for co-regulating.\u201d Justin\n\u201cI am still digesting the ripples from this profoundly moving workshop, and am beyond grateful for the aligned new connections that have come out of it\u201d - Rachel\n\u201cI love Laurie\u2019s energy, wisdom, execution and light touch\u201d - Tess\nSam Baker (she/her)\nSam is an experienced facilitator and has seven years of experience with somatic modalities, including contact improvisation and somatic experiencing. She previously ran \u2018Embodied Empowerment\u2019 with Laurie and wrote the \u2018Hierarchy of Physical Needs\u2019 (which the workshop was inspired by) based on observations and conversations around \u201cWhy does Contact Improv feel so safe & satisfying?\u201d\nHere\u2019s what others have shared about Sam\u2019s work:\n\u201cLearning about the Hierarchy of Physical Needs really made sense to me. I realise how I\u2019ve impulsively entered into relationships or romantic encounters when really I was just craving playfulness, or connection, or touch\u201d - James\n\u201cI really enjoyed the exercises as an opportunity to get out of my mind and into my body.

This summer, a new company of players, The Midsummer Botanicals, invite audiences to step beneath the trees and into the wild, wondrous world of As You Like It - a sun-soaked celebration of laughter and community blooming in one of Wellington\u2019s gorgeous parks for the first week of the Wellington Fringe Festival.\n\nIn 1983, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream lit up the Victoria University Quad and sparked a beloved tradition of outdoor Shakespeare in Wellington - a festival of artistry, friendship, and open-air delight that ran for over forty years. After its sudden end in 2023, a vital chapter of our city\u2019s cultural story seemed to close. But this February, the Botanicals are bringing it gloriously back to life.\n\nHelmed by director Eli Hancock (he/they) and produced by Shakespeare\u2019s North Productions, As You Like It promises a riotous return to form; where the music is live, the language sparkles, and the forest is very much alive.\n\n\u201cAs You Like It is Shakespeare at his most joyous,\u201d says Hancock. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding yourself in unexpected places - through love, disguise, friendship, and the wilderness. After years of loss and uncertainty in the arts, this feels like a healing; a reminder of why we make theatre in the first place.\u201d\n\nSet in a vibrant reimagining of Shakespeare\u2019s Forest of Arden, this production draws on courtyard and marketplace traditions of performance, transforming Wellington\u2019s Aro Valley Park into a living, breathing garden of music, colour, and character. Audiences are invited to arrive early, explore the space, and meet the motley cast of lovers and fools before the story even begins. Expect song, sun, silliness, and the scent of summer roses.",

So, you need to follow provided instructions, and answer questions along the way correctly to win a prize. There is no prize for being the fastest. This rally has been organized for the Kapiti chapter of the MX-5 Club of NZ, but any other MX-5 drivers are welcome. Details below:\n\nWe will be meeting at the same place as last time - the Park 'n' Ride carpark at Manor Park, Lower Hutt, at 9am. Don't worry - we'll be doing completely different roads this time!\n\nThere is no breakfast at the start, but if people are interested, we could informally meet at Town & Country in Stokes Valley for breakfast beforehand,then all drive to the Park 'n' Ride together in convoy.\n\nYou will need to bring a pen or pencil, and something to press on, such as a clipboard, or a hardcover book. You will also need something you can take evidence photos with - a cellphone or digital camera will be fine.\n\nI also highly, highly recommend that you bring a co-driver, as it will make things infinitely easier for you. Call Russell on 021 0269 3224 if you have trouble finding a co-driver, as I can assist with that!\n\nLike last time, there will be prizes for 1st, 2nd & 3rd, but the prizes are based on who gets the most answers correct, and NOT on who is fastest to complete the course.\n\nLunch will be at the end point, so bring some $$$ with you.\n\nSnacks will again be provided along the way. This event is free for members of The Kapiti Chapter of the MX-5 Club of NZ, or $2 per car for non-members of that club. This will cover the cost of the provided snacks, plus the photocopying. Thanks.\n\nFurther instructions on the day, but if you attended the last rally I organised, then you'll know what to expect. You'll need about 1/2 a tank of gas.\n\nPlease RSVP to Russell by texting 021 0269 3224 by Friday 13 Feb, so I can ensure that there are enough printed instructions for everyone.\n\n",

Letting go of all connection to stress and the identity that the ego clings to.\n\nInvesting in the imagery that all of our cells hold the energy of our past. The trauma and struggles often block the gifts and wisdom from flowing through us. The wisdom and gifts are where the breath of the Divine can give life to our soul's purpose. When we surrender our hold on the trauma, struggles, pain and hardships of our past, we make room for the Divine to flow in.\n\nIn these journeys, we surrender all of the building blocks of our identity.\n\nThis then creates space for the new gifts to be connected into our soul magic. Allowing the energy of the creator to rebuild our Souls to hold the strongest vibration of our infinite possibilities.\n\nWe will be gridding ourselves in the crystals from the tent, before the journey. After the journey, you will have some quiet time to write, draw or just reflect.\nThese journeys are deep and divine. Please come in comfortable clothing and ready to be changed for the better.\n\n",

    "long_description": "*Murder at Checkmate Manor Auditions*\n*AUDITION NOTICE *\n\nThe four hapless ladies of the Farndale Drama Guild (and their long-suffering stage manager) are putting on their overly-ambitious murder mystery play that would have Agatha Christie turning in her grave. Set at the remote country house, Checkmate Manor, a dastardly murderer is lurking about, killing people. The dirty rotter is trying to discover the contents of the late Sir Reginald Bishop\u2019s will to have the inheritance altered in their favour. And what better way to ensure they are the sole beneficiary than to bump of all of Bishop\u2019s relatives on the very night they\u2019re all gathered for the reading of the will.\nOpening night descends into chaos as scenery falls, costumes get mixed up, and the plot unravels, forcing the cast to improvise wildly.\nWhat the Farndale ladies lack in talent, they certainly make up for with fierce enthusiasm, an unfounded sense of ability and a surprisingly good souffle recipe.\n\nWe are seeking 5 actors to bring our play to life!\nCharacter Descriptions:\n\nMrs. Phoebe Reece: (50 +) The \"bossy\" leading figure and president of the group who attempts to direct and hold the chaotic production together. Has an underlying rivalry with Thelma which she tries (unsuccessfully) to mask. Must be able to do a French accent.\nPlays Clarissa Rook, (Lady Bishop\u2019s sister), Regine (the French maid), Patricia Bishop (Lady Bishop\u2019s niece), Leticia Bishop (her sister), Mr Goodbody (a solicitor)\n\nThelma: (50+) Mrs. Reece's rival, a dressmaker who is keen to show off her costume skills. Has a simmering dislike for Mrs Reece and is repelled by Gordan\u2019s advances. Ability to do a strong Yorkshire accent.\nPlays Daphne Bishop (Lady Bishop\u2019s daughter), Rose Bishop (her spinster Aunt)\n\nFelicity: A younger cast member. Plays two male parts. Not as stilted and awkward as Audrey or Gordon. Uses male voices\nPlays Pawn (the butler), Colonel King (Lady Bishop\u2019s brother-in-law)\n\n\nAudrey: A dithering, clumsy character who struggles with lines and delivery. Ability to do a strong Yorkshire accent.\nPlays Lady Doreen Bishop (a widow), Violet Bishop (her spinster aunt), Mrs King (the colonel\u2019s wife), Joan bishop (Lady Bishop\u2019s cousin)\n\nGordon: Roped in to play the inept inspector at the last minute and is clearly out of his comfort zone. A dry physicality needed and staccato utterances of lines (due to his inability to act)\nPlays Inspector O\u2019Reilly\n\n\n(Note; ages are just a guide. For this play, looking older is preferable. Parts are not suitable for young teenagers)\n\n\nThis is a play-within-a-play.\nCharacters often \u2018break the 4th wall\u2019 and \u2018break character\u2019. All characters interact with the audience to some extent. These characters are heavily nuanced \u2013 with the need for surreptitious, annoyed glances, double takes, etc. Have fun reading and getting into your character\u2019s head.\n\nAny questions or queries contact our Director Heidi Atkins via email or phone.\n027 733 4059\n\n",

We will have a model for each session, and I'll be there from 1pm setting up. Feel free to get there early and get yourself a good spot and set up.\n\nWe're in the painting studio at Hutt Art Society, 9/11 Myrtle St, Lower Hutt.\n\nThese sessions are different to Queer trans drawing class in that I won't be teaching the whole class. I wanna draw together! So I will be drawing too. I'll start us off with some great warm ups, and then we'll have timed poses, where you can use the techniques I've shared, or your own ones, to keep drawing. We will take breaks where we walk around and look at each other's drawings - always a great way to get new inspiration for techniques!\n\nThere are easels, tables, chairs and the horse things you can straddle and put a drawing board on. It's super warm, and private - all windows have blinds.\n\nThe session is $35 if you\u2019re a waged person $20 unwaged / low waged \u2013 please pay in advance to reserve your spot and so I can get organised \u2013 nau mai haere mai, let me know if you wanna come!\n\nSome materials provided, but to keep costs down I\u2019m not providing all the materials so please do bring your own as well. All materials welcome, it's up to you! I recommend bringing different kinds of paper too - shopping bags, newspaper, cardboard... different papers create interesting drawings.\n\n\n",

    "long_description": "MX-5 Rally - Sunday 15th Feb\nPlease note that this is a rally, and not a race. So, you need to follow provided instructions, and answer questions along the way correctly to win a prize. There is no prize for being the fastest. This rally has been organized for the Kapiti chapter of the MX-5 Club of NZ, but any other MX-5 drivers are welcome. Details below:\nWe will be meeting at the same place as last time - the Park 'n' Ride carpark at Manor Park, Lower Hutt, at 9am. Don't worry - we'll be doing completely different roads this time!\nThere is no breakfast at the start, but if people are interested, we could informally meet at Town & Country in Stokes Valley for breakfast beforehand,then all drive to the Park 'n' Ride together in convoy.\nYou will need to bring a pen or pencil, and something to press on, such as a clipboard, or a hardcover book. You will also need something you can take evidence photos with - a cellphone or digital camera will be fine.\nI also highly, highly recommend that you bring a co-driver, as it will make things infinitely easier for you. Call Russell on 021 0269 3224 if you have trouble finding a co-driver, as I can assist with that!\nLike last time, there will be prizes for 1st, 2nd & 3rd, but the prizes are based on who gets the most answers correct, and NOT on who is fastest to complete the course.\nLunch will be at the end point, so bring some $$$ with you.\nSnacks will again be provided along the way. This event is free for members of The Kapiti Chapter of the MX-5 Club of NZ, or $2 per car for non-members of that club. This will cover the cost of the provided snacks, plus the photocopying. Thanks.\nFurther instructions on the day, but if you attended the last rally I organised, then you'll know what to expect. You'll need about 1/2 a tank of gas.\nPlease RSVP to Russell by texting 021 0269 3224 by Friday 13 Feb, so I can ensure that there are enough printed instructions for everyone. ",

    "long_description": "STEAMS is an integrated approach to learning topics of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths, and Society that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. Its aim is to teach real world skills through engaging methods whilst allowing individuals to be creative. This involves immersing tamariki into projects and activities that develop innovation and champion curiosity. STEAMS is not \u2018play based learning\u2019 but focused learning through an integrated hands-on approach allowing children to take risks and explore their own curiosity in a subject without time barriers.\nAt the Ministry of Inspiration we offer STEAMS learning each term for Year 1-8 students. Once a week students will attend a class at Waterlea Racecourse, Blenheim on TUESDAY or THURSDAY. STEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) start at 9am and finish at 2:45pm on TUESDAY. Little STEAMerS operates from 9-12 on THURSDAY. STEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) operates on THURSDAY from 9am to 245 pm. \nInquiry, collaboration, and an emphasis on process-based learning are at the heart of the STEAM approach. Each term the classes will have a focus which drives the learning and our amazing teachers create opportunities to help each student develop their understanding, improve their skills and gain knowledge in a range of topics.\nStudents who participate in STEAM learning:\n\u00b7 think outside the box\n\u00b7 feel safe to express innovative and creative ideas\n\u00b7 feel comfortable doing hands-on learning\n\u00b7 take ownership over their learning\n\u00b7 work collaboratively with others\n\u00b7 understand the ways that science, maths, the arts, and technology work together\n\u00b7 become increasingly curious about the world around them and feel empowered to change it for the better.\nWhen does it meet, and where?\nThe school is held during school terms.\nSTEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) TUESDAY, 9-245.\nSTEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) THURSDAY, 9-245\nLittle STEAMerS (ages 5-6) THURSDAY 12-3.\nLocation:  Waterlea Racecourse, enter off of Linton St.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe students come for a paid three-week trial-as a new student you pay for that through Humanitix.\nIf both family and teacher feel there is a good fit for the child in the class, they continue for the rest of the term. You are then invoiced for the full term less the amount paid for the Trial.\nPayment is by term, with a cost of $73 incl. GST We have a limited number of scholarships available that are awarded on a term by term basis for those with financial need for 25% off. \nLittle STEAMerS is $30 incl. GST.\nWill my child\u2019s school mind that they miss a day per week?\nYou will need to inform the child\u2019s school that he or she will be at STEAMS School one day per week. To date we have not encountered any issues around accommodating a child\u2019s participation in STEAMS School, and many of the region\u2019s schools are very supportive of the programme. Once enrolled, you are encouraged to inform the teacher and office staff that your child should be marked present for the day they attend STEAMS School, as they will be attending an academic school as opposed to being absent due to illness or other reasons.",

Books will be for sale with thanks to Unity Books.\n'I never kept a diary, except for one year of my life. The year I turned fourteen. The year my parents divorced. The year I had sex for the first time. The year I learned to use the microfiche.'\nIn this unique follow-up to her memoir You Probably Think This Song Is About You, Kate Camp turns her poet's eye on her 1986 diary. Reading The Diary in its entirety for the first time, she revels in 80s touchstones like Revlon Custom Eyes and Ghostbusters on VHS. But amid the daily details, like smoking menthols in Suzy's Coffee Lounge and wearing Jazzercise tights in a phone box, are moments of drama, even tragedy \u2013 being black-out drunk in a spa pool, or watching her father move out of the family home. At the centre of it all is Cameron, his black hair falling over his eyes, intoning in his fake Scottish accent, 'Treat me rough, baby.'\nThese entries \u2013 over 100 reproduced in full \u2013 are a time capsule of a very different era. The Kate Camp of today responds to the blithe accounts of sex, drugs and risk-taking with horror and admiration. How real are our memories? Can we ever know ourselves? And why is every entry signed off Leather & Chains?\n'Kate Camp reads the words of grownupchild Kate of 1986 \u2013 achingly funny, arch and louche, often shocking, always clever. And all of it threaded through with such pain and sadness and unsettling darkness, such yearning to be loved.' \u2014Tracy Farr, author of Wonderland\n'IF YOU EVER GET TO SEE KATE CAMP READ FROM HER 14YO DIARY DO IT FUCKING DO IT.' \u2014Melody Thomas, host of The Good Sex Project\nKate Camp is the author of the memoir You Probably Think This Song Is About You (2022) and eight acclaimed collections of poems, including The Mirror of Simple Annihilated Souls (winner of the NZ Post Book Award for Poetry in 2011), How to Be Happy Though Human: New and Selected Poems (2020), and Makeshift Seasons (2025).\nCover: Todd Atticus ",

This tour marks the first chance for fans to hear the new songs live.\nExploding onto the scene in 2003 with their now-classic debut Permission To Land, The Darkness quickly became one of the UK\u2019s most beloved rock bands, racking up over 1.5 million album sales, a headline set at Reading & Leeds in 2004, and a string of major awards including BRITs, Kerrang!, and an Ivor Novell.\nThe band\u2019s cheeky, spandex-clad anthems changed the face of British rock and continue to capture hearts and a new generation of fans around the world. Their live shows are pure spectacle: soaring falsettos, outrageous outfits, endless guitar solos, and crowds belting out every word. Don\u2019t miss your chance to experience it all live in 2026 - it\u2019s bold, loud, and gloriously over-the-top fun.\nJoining The Darkness on their Australia & New Zealand tour is emerging Australian artist RAGEFLOWER \u2013 a magnetic force of cinematic alt-rock whose sound blurs the boundaries of emotion, experimentation and raw power. Her music balances fragility and strength in equal measure. Her live performances are powerful and deeply felt \u2013 part confessional, part spectacle \u2013 earning her a rapidly growing international audience across the U.S., Japan and Europe, and positioning her as one of Australia\u2019s most compelling new voices.",

If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you. \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\n\ud83c\udf88 HOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll never have to speak in public if you don\u2019t want to!\n\n\n\ud83d\udd79 HOW TO JOIN?\n\nTake 2 minutes to fill out our form \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\nhttps://luma.com/ftst2wellington\n\nOur events are limited to 30 handpicked guests to ensure a cozy atmosphere.

Give it a try!\u201d - Brenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udde3 \"it\u2019s a wonderful experience, it\u2019s like being a kid again, when you were at the park, playing with other kids, and just decided you were going to be best friends for the next hours.

But that hour was amazing because you both opened up and trusted each other.\" - Sara\n\n\n\ud83d\udde3 \u201cLively, interesting, introspective, completely open and no judgement. Everyone that joined was ready for great conversation and helped with different perspectives. So much fun!

Why?\nWe usually get a high volume of sign-ups yet we like to keep it cozy & only about 30 people. We believe this is a good number to ensure an awesome experience! Please try again next time if do not receive an invite - no hard feelings \ud83d\udc9b\n\n\n\u2022 Why do you charge?\nWe value our time and put a lot of love, planning, and effort into creating & designing these experiences. \u2665\ufe0f This is our project/business and what we give to the world and we think everything should be a fair exchange!

Can I get involved somehow?\nSure thing, send us a message!\n\n\n\u2022 Can I bring my cute dog/llama?\nIt depends on where the event is! Message us to make sure.

    "long_description": "Spoon Show @ NZ Fringe 2026\nAh, the humble kitchen spoon. So soft, so harmless, so simple.\n\nA spoon can become many things. An airplane, an embrace, a swip-swap creating willy sords or perhaps two swords? A loved one, an enemy, a catapult, a shamefully niche musical instrument. Can a clown be a spoon? What actually IS a spoon, really? Does a spork count? Ponder these deep questions and more as Fumble the Clown explores the infinite comedic potential of cutlery.\n\nIt is unclear where the clown got so many of these metal wonders, or for what purpose. But with a fool\u2019s brain, a dancer\u2019s body and a determination usually reserved only for the truly idiotic, this charming clown will joke, dance, juggle (badly), sing and invite their audience to join the show, creating an unforgettable hour of ridiculous comedy.\n\nSpoon Show is the sophomore solo work created by award-winning Aotearoa-based dancer-turned-clown Daniel Nodder, whose work has been described as a \u201ctour-de-force\u201d, \u201cbeyond human\u201d and \u201cpure artistry\u201d. After developing this new work at \u00c9cole Philippe Gaulier, Daniel brings all of their absurdist comedy and multi-award-winning movement skills to this performance. Performing alongside quirky sound design & composition by Ben Kelly and clever technical design by Rebekah de Roo, this production is a perfectly balanced spoonful of comedy soup.\n\nBe delighted by the simple stupidity and ironic inventiveness of a show about spoons.\n\nPrevious awards won by Daniel Nodder:\nWINNER: Outstanding Performance Award - Dunedin Fringe 2025 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Dance / Physical Theatre Award - Dunedin Fringe 2025 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Artist's Pick Award - San Diego International Fringe 2024 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Outside the Box Award - San Diego International Fringe 2024 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance - New Zealand Fringe 2023 (Only Bones)\nNOMINATED: Best in Fringe - New Zealand Fringe 2023 & 2025 (Only Bones; Entry: Encounter)\nNOMINATED: Performer of the Year - Wellington Theatre Awards 2023 (Only Bones)\n\n",

    "long_description": "Ah, the humble kitchen spoon. So soft, so harmless, so simple.\n\nA spoon can become many things. An airplane, an embrace, an -erism creating willy sords or perhaps two swords? A loved one, an enemy, a catapult, a shamefully niche musical instrument. Can a clown be a spoon? What actually IS a spoon, really? Does a spork count? Ponder these deep questions and more as Fumble the Clown explores the infinite comedic potential of cutlery.\n\nIt is unclear where the clown got so many of these metal wonders, or for what purpose. But with a fool\u2019s brain, a dancer\u2019s body and a determination usually reserved only for the truly idiotic, this charming clown will joke, dance, juggle (badly), sing and invite their audience to join the show, creating an unforgettable hour of ridiculous comedy.\n\nSpoon Show is the sophomore solo work created by award-winning Aotearoa-based dancer-turned-clown Daniel Nodder (ratKing, Only Bones, World of WearableArt 2025), whose work has been described as a \u201ctour-de-force\u201d, \u201cbeyond human\u201d and \u201cpure artistry\u201d. After developing this new character at \u00c9cole Philippe Gaulier and a sold-our development showing in NZ Fringe 2025, Daniel brings all of their absurdist comedy and multi-award-winning movement skills to this premiere. Performing alongside quirky sound design & composition by Ben Kelly and clever technical design by Rebekah de Roo, this production is a perfectly balanced spoonful of comedy soup.\n\nBe delighted by the simple stupidity and ironic inventiveness of a show about spoons.\n\nPrevious awards won by Daniel Nodder:\nWINNER: Outstanding Performance Award - Dunedin Fringe 2025 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Dance / Physical Theatre Award - Dunedin Fringe 2025 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Artist's Pick Award - San Diego International Fringe 2024 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Outside the Box Award - San Diego International Fringe 2024 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance - New Zealand Fringe 2023 (Only Bones)\nNOMINATED: Best in Fringe - New Zealand Fringe 2023 & 2025 (Only Bones; Entry: Encounter)\nNOMINATED: Performer of the Year - Wellington Theatre Awards 2023 (Only Bones)",

    "long_description": "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention initially developed for emotional disorders. It is now widely used in supporting people to deal with the challenges of physical ill-health. Professionals from various backgrounds can learn to use a simplified CBT skills set, and use of these skills enables them to be more effective in managing aspects of their patients\u2019 distress.\nThe training is a mix of theory, skills demonstration and skills practice, giving participants a better understanding of the applicability of the skill set in their area of practice and providing some skills to take away. Training sessions are spaced to allow participants to use their new skills in their clinical practice. Each participant reflects on their learning and their work with a specific patient, and the whole group reflects on lessons learned. In this way, learning remains rooted in participants\u2019 clinical practice. These CBT courses are consistently evaluated highly by participants.\nThe Course\nTeaching will be commenced with 2 days of in person sessions. 19th and 20th Feb 2026 at Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington and subsequently 2 sessions on-line via Zoom. The online sessions will be on 8th April and 27th May at 5pm for 3.5 hours.\nAttendance at all sessions is mandatory to complete the course.\nThe courses cost is $850 per person (incl GST).\nThe Trainers\nKathy Burn was a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Palliative Care who went on to train in CBT and to develop the CBT service at St Christopher\u2019s Hospice, London. She now works in CBT in chronic pain, and she teaches and supervises CBT trainees at the institute of Psychiatry, London.\nKathryn Mannix was a Palliative Medicine Consultant and CBT therapist. She developed \u2018CBT First Aid\u2019 to enable palliative care clinicians to adapt skills from CBT into their clinical practice. She is an author. There are insights into her use of CBT in her books With the End in Mind and Listen.\nTerms and Conditions\nAttendance: In order to create a learning community for each course, it is important that each person on a course attends every session and is able to join in the discussions by keeping up with the course. By accepting a place on a particular course, you agree to attend all the sessions, to arrive on time, and to work alongside your group members during the session to support each other's learning. Each session builds on the last, and you'll be asked to put your new learning into practice in- between sessions. Building learning groups in this way means we can't add new trainees after a course has begun.\nWe are not able to run catch-up sessions for sessions missed. If you miss sessions, you may be asked to withdraw from the course and no refunds will be given.\nRefunds/Canellations: Once you sign up and pay, we won't be able to refund your payment unless we can reallocate your place to another person before the course begins. The deadline for cancelling your place is 28 days before the day and time of the first session. If you cancel and we can fill your place with another person, we'll offer you the choice of a refund or a place on a future course, if places are available. We will do our best to fill your place, but we can't promise this. Refunds will incur an administration fee.\nDates and Times of Sessions: all dates and times are given in NZ time, and this varies over the year. It is up to you to check the correct time in your time zone: you may find this website useful to check your own time zone with Auckland NZ time on each specific date: https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/\nTrainers: we have a team of trainers, all of whom are experienced CBT therapists and trainers, and all are familiar with applying CBT in physical health settings. Different sessions may be taught by different trainers, or by 'guest appearances' by some of our team. The team of trainers will ensure there is continuity of content and of learning as the course progresses.\nSpecial circumstances: Sometimes, life events appear unexpectedly. If something unexpected prevents you from attending, please let us know as early as you can, and we will give consideration to how we might be able to support you to continue your training if that is what you wish to do.",

    "long_description": "[OFFSITE] Jim White (Aus) & Marisa Anderson (US) with Motte + UMU\nOffsite at Meow, 9 Edward Street, Wellington\n\nJim White & Marisa Anderson\nThe collaboration between renowned drummer Jim White (Dirty Three, PJ Harvey, Bonnie Prince Billy, Cat Power) and acclaimed US guitarist Marisa Anderson is a natural union of two of the most intuitive players and listeners working in music. White and Anderson are both in high demand as collaborators, in no small part because of their mastery, versatility and highly expressive playing. The duo have amassed an impressive body of work together (including their 2020 debut The Quickening and 2024\u2019s Swallowtail), and each remain at the vanguard of their practices due to an insatiable curiosity and delight in exploration of new avenues of expression.\n\n---\n\nMarisa Anderson channels the history of the guitar and stretches the boundaries of tradition. Her playing is fluid, emotional, and masterful, featuring compositions and improvisations that re-imagine the landscape of American music. Her work applies elements of minimalism, electronic music, drone and 20th century classical music to compositions based on blues, jazz, gospel and country music.\n\n---\n\nDrummer Jim White first come to attention in the mid-1990s with the acclaimed Australian instrumental trio Dirty Three, and is now recognised internationally as one of the most creative and expressive drummers on the planet. His unique playing style and deft way with sound and rhythm has seen him become the go-to drummer for a huge number of alt-A-list vocalists with collaboration in mind. PJ Harvey has said there is ballet in White\u2019s light, precise touch. And the other collaborators that he\u2019s mesmerised, including the likes of Bonnie Prince Billy, Smog, Nick Cave, White Magic, Beth Orton, Marianne Faithfull, Kurt Vile, Cat Power and the iconic Cretan lyra player Psarantonis, all know that there\u2019s more to White\u2019s drumming than mere accompaniment. His intuitive beats and singular approach have created sparks in his collaborations. Whoever White is playing with, he is right there, present in the most inspirational sense.\n\n---\n\nMotte is the solo project of violinist and composer, Anita Clark. Riding the thin line between beauty and devastation, Motte weaves together a richly textured world with a violin, delay pedal, sampled sound and voice. Creating a world solely her own, the sound is modern classical, ambient, alt/experimental pop and improvised noise. Her musical gifts and skilful reach across genres makes her an indispensable collaborator with The Phoenix Foundation, Luke Buda, Marlon Williams, Don McGlashan, the Renderers, Nadia Reid, Lawrence Arabia, Delaney Davidson and plenty of others. As Motte, she dances around the shining candescence of her culture like a night insect, always seeking a better vantage point to the light.\n\n---\n\nUMU is a duo of Riki Gooch and Daniel Beban. Silver Apples meets Kuduro with Riki's deep grooves played on an 80s Roland electronic drum kit which are manipulated and dubbed out by Dan on two Tama Techstar drum synths.\n\n$35 earlybird tickets via Meow / $20 unwaged\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

Alongside these collective beginnings, there is also your personal New Year. In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore when the New Year begins for you individually. Your birth chart can highlight which areas of life may come into focus and what influences them. We will also discuss why planetary movements and transits affect some people more strongly than others.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore the 12-year cycle, where a different area of life becomes the main focus each year. You will see how this pattern repeats every 12 years, and why \u2014 even as the cycle returns \u2014 each experience can feel unique.\n\nBy the end of the workshop you will get some ideas about why your New Year is personal to you from an astrological perspective. The workshop will be interactive, so feel free to share your stories and, if you would like, bring your natal chart with you.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s an amazing plant-based dinner and dessert included in your ticket!\n\nMeet Jelena, your host\nJelena has been passionate about astrology and was fortunate to begin her studies under the guidance of one of New Zealand\u2019s most respected astrologers, who helped her start on the right path. From the very beginning, she has pursued her learning independently, drawing extensively from recommended books. Last year, she completed a course in Horary Astrology through the School of Traditional Astrology (STA). She is currently continuing her studies through a one-on-one course with a traditional astrology teacher in the UK while also receiving mentorship from an astrologer based in Perth, Australia.",

In this talk, Ruary takes his listeners back to basics on the amazing life-cycle of these insects. He outlines typical preferred dragonfly habitats, and touches on identification of New Zealand species. In addition to Ruary\u2019s talk, Kari\u2019s larva demonstration table shows actual examples of the larval stages on NZ species.\n\nIn their New Zealand work, Ruary and Kari are carrying out survey work on behalf of the Greater Wellington Regional Council, and are preparing a dragonfly education pack for schools. They have also carried out five summer seasons of night-filming an endemic dragonfly species \u2013 the Bush Giant \u2013 that lives in a burrow! A Radio New Zealand Our Changing World programme has been devoted to their work. (https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/ourchangingworld/546925/dragonflies-masters-of-flight).\n\nRuary and Kari have been working with dragonflies since 1985. They opened Europe\u2019s first Dragonfly Sanctuary in 1991, and founded the National Dragonfly Biomuseum in Northamptonshire in 1995. They and their team of volunteers continued work with the National Trust at Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire, and were instrumental in the setting up of the Dragonfly Centre there in 2009. Their adventures were published in Ruary\u2019s memoir, The Dragonfly Diaries (Saraband, 2014). Kari and Ruary have also published a how-to book, Dragonfly-Friendly Gardening (Saraband, 2024). Ruary is a Fellow of the Linnean Society. He has given talks in eight countries. He has appeared on both television and radio, and was awarded BBC Springwatch\u2019s \u2018Dragonfly Geek\u2019 award. He has been featured in BBC Wildlife Magazine, The Scottish Field, and in Wildlife Trust and National Trust publications.

    "long_description": "USUI REIKI LEVEL TWO IN KAPITI with Heartsong\nLevel Two Usui Reiki is a significant development on from Level One. Get in touch to enquire. You can study Level Two with me if you had your Level One attunement elsewhere.\n\nThis TWO DAY course offers 10 hours of in person training, a full manual, certificate of completion, a follow up Zoom call and ongoing support. Maximum of 6 participants to enable close support and interaction.\n\nLevel 2 involves a new powerful attunement and learning new techniques such as Distance Reiki, sacred reiki symbols, and preparing for working on people you may not know. You can start charging for your Reiki services after completing level two.\n\nWe learn about three Reiki symbols and practice drawing them. By Day 2 it is expected that you have memorized how to draw Level 2 Symbols (I teach with a gap between day 1&2 so this is very achievable).\n\nBecoming competent at distance healing is a significant priority of Level 2 training and we will have plenty of practice doing this. Distance healing is practiced on people and animals. Basic business set up is discussed.\n\nAdvanced Practitioner Level Reiki is a great tool if you want to feel centered in your life, it helps to balance and align our energy bodies, and can cause positive changes in many areas of our lives. Reiki can be used to help heal a wide number of conditions and to initiate and support positive life changes. Further details on enquiry. Reiki Level 2 opens you to a deeper channel of healing energy and enables you to offer healing professionally.\n\nDates are specially chosen to be auspicious in relation to the moon and cosmic energies\n\nSaturday FEBRUARY 21ST, 10.am-4.30pm\n\nSaturday MARCH 14TH, 10am-4.30pm\n\nThe gap in between the two training days allows you to receive support as you experience the 21 day 'cleanse' and integration period after the Reiki attunement - and also enable time to work on developing and practicing the material learnt in the first days training.\n\nTotal of 12 hours tuition time plus some at home practice/study required.\n\nLight simple shared lunches are provided - you will need to bring a contribution.\n\nHerbal teas and light snacks are also provided.\n\nLocation: Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Corner of Aorangi and Tutanekai Streets, Paraparaumu\n\nPre-enrollment questionnaire -\n\nInvestment:\n\n\u00a3555 for full TWO day course, training, all support materials including manual, certificate, light healthy lunch, refreshments and ongoing support. Plus extra hours online in follow up Zoom call on 21st day.\n\nPay in Full Here - https://buy.stripe.com/9B628q2W4ahTghqdcKew81V\n\nA non-refundable $155 deposit secures your place - book here: https://buy.stripe.com/eVqcN4bsA89LaX6b4Cew81S\n\nThere is a payment plan available - contact me\n\nBryony is a Usui Reiki Master Teacher and she has 27 years healing experience. She loves teaching this precious, versatile healing skill and it gives her great pleasure to offer this training in Lancaster\n\nBryony says:\nReiki has had a powerful positive influence on my life, helping me to heal and change mindset, physical and emotional conditions, and to see life in a new light. Reiki helped with my recovery from Chronic Fatigue syndrome and Depression \u2764 I will share this with you in this course and help you open your life to the positive transformation that Reiki can bring.\n\nIf you are interested in coming on this course, please contact me by email at to receive a questionnaire to answer which gives me a sense of your interest, previous experience of Reiki healing and conditions I should be aware of.\n\nCancellation Policy:\n\nIf Heartsong Healing needs to cancel the course all payments are refunded. If you withdraw from the course before 14 days before start date, your payment will be refunded minus the 55 deposit, kept as an admin fee. If you withdraw within 14 -7 days 50% of your payment will be refunded, 7-3 days 75% of your payment will be refunded, 3 days no refund.

From their humble street performing roots in Dublin to global stages, the band continues to deliver electrifying performances that blend cultural storytelling and raw musical spirit with spontaneity and soulful energy.\n\nAfter winning the Street Entertainers of the Year award in 1985, the band caught the eye of U2\u2019s Bono, leading to a record deal with PolyGram. Their 1988 debut album, People, topped the Irish charts and hit number two in the UK, establishing them as a captivating live band with a dedicated global fanbase. The album features their highest streaming single to date, the utterly sublime, Don't Go.\n\nHome followed in 1990 and featured the band\u2019s gorgeous cover of the Johnny Nash classic, I Can See Clearly Now, which was given a new lease of life and used to stunning affect in the opening scene of 2016's Jeremy Clarkson's Grand Tour TV show. Watch the incredible intro here. Home along with 93\u2019s Songs From the Rain cemented the bands place as one Ireland\u2019s greats. The Australian tour follows the release of their latest album, Let\u2019s Do This Thing (2020)\n\nKnown for their unpredictable energy and impromptu improvisation, every Hothouse Flowers show is unique experience. From rock anthems to soulful ballads and traditional songs that evoke the emotional weight of Irish storytelling, the band\u2019s performances are a journey through musical and cultural landscapes. Their shows are marked by humour, raw expression and a deep connection with audiences, making each gig a one of a kind event.\n\nDon\u2019t miss one of the most celebrated returns of the year!\n\n",

A particular focus will be how complexity science has evolved and how it is informing contemporary actions and solutions for prosperous, resilient, equitable and democratic societies \u2013 amid growing global challenges.\nThe symposium will explore complexity through a rich interdisciplinary lens, bringing together philosophical and epistemological perspectives alongside practical insights from fields including artificial intelligence, infrastructure, health, education, climate, and the environment, and cutting-edge insights from M\u0101ori and local communities.

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

Run by mums, for mums, we support and connect women facing the changes and challenges of being a mum through discussion groups. We also consider the impact motherhood has on other aspects of life, including relationships, career and sense of wellbeing.\nIncluded in your workshop\nYou will be guided by Lara Phillips, a trained creative facilitator in Interactive Drawing Therapy, through drawing prompts (similar to a guided meditation or journaling) to draw out where you are at and draw out your own inner guidance.

The work is an intimate exploration of sisterhood through the lens of Aylin's roots and identity as a Turkish/Pakeha woman.\n\nFive dancers will explore how sisterhood affects the individual and the group as one entity. Women together in comfort, sharing the same mundane experiences.\n\nThe games we make up, the\u202c \u202dfuture we see together, the life we romanticise. The culture we are all at the root of, and the\u202c hope there are better days ahead.\n\nTaking influence from Turkish traditions and Aylin's interest in reflecting the human experience, the audience will witness intertwined female connections that hold up the group and carry stories, memories and values. Viewers will observe how this culture stays rooted in the individual while they are alone and how sisterhood is a bond that keeps things moving.\n\nIt is a journey of surrendering to the space together and enjoying simplicity, nostalgia, and the tangents relationships have. We are a result of the women who raised us. How do we continue to carve this path for others?",

During her research, she interviewed leaders from all over the world \u2014 from Fortune 100 companies, non-profits, public sector entities, and more \u2014 and asked one question: what is the future of leadership?\nRemarkably, their answers pointed to one thing: we need braver leaders.\n\n\nWe need more courage.\n\nThe most significant finding from Bren\u00e9\u2019s latest research, and the foundation of Dare to Lead\u2122, is that courage is a collection of four skill sets that are teachable, measurable, and observable.\n\n\nAfter completing the three-day Dare to Lead\u2122 programme you'll understand how to:\nEffectively navigate vulnerability and unlock change\nTurn values from fluffy language into tangible, practical behaviours\nBuild a common culture of trust in your team\nCultivate the skills to rise from setbacks and be more resilient\n\n\nThis curriculum is essential for teams who want to:\nBe better equipped to deal with difficult conversations\nReduce unhealthy and unproductive behaviour\nBe more creative and innovative\nBuild resilience and improve alignment\nFoster a culture of accountability and trust\n\n\nThis experience is for you if:\nYou're in a position of leadership within your organisation\nYou see the potential in people and processes, and are willing to take responsibility for achieving that potential\nYou\u2019re passionate about accelerating performance in yourself and others\nYou have to navigate organisational change as part of your role\n\n\n\nNeed help with the cost?\nIf you are an Educator or at a Not-for-Profit, you can automatically access a special price of $1,995 + GST when you register.\nWe also have partial scholarships available to attend the programme.

No lineups. No pecking order. No sacred cows. Just brave humans, questionable decisions, and whatever name comes out of the jar. It\u2019s equal parts comedy show, social experiment, and mild psychological thriller.\n\nYou might see a first-timer doing their very first set. You might see a seasoned comic testing brand-new material. You might see someone absolutely smash it. You might see someone discover, in real time, that jokes are harder than they look. That\u2019s the magic.\n\nCome early, grab some food, sip a cocktail, and settle in. The room fills fast, the energy builds quicker, and being there from the start means you\u2019re fully invested when the jar starts causing trouble.\n\nIf you love comedy in its rawest, most unpredictable form \u2014 this is your night.\nIf you\u2019ve ever thought \u201cI could probably do that\u201d \u2014 the jar would love to meet you.\n\nCheap laughs. Big vibes. Absolute chaos.\nWelcome home.\n\n",

    "long_description": "\"Faster and faster. And for a long time you wouldn't feel anything. And then you'd burst into fire\" - Laura Palmer\nTWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME.\nDAVID LYNCH | USA & FRANCE | 1992 | 135mins | R18+| 4K DCP PROVIDED BY JANUS FILMS DISTRIBUTION\nJoin us for this very special community fundraiser screening of the prequel to the critically acclaimed series, \"Twin Peaks\".\nABC cancelled the original series after season 2 but a month later, Lynch announced he was \"not yet finished with the material\" and principal photography for the full length prequel film, began on September 5th 1991 at a caravan site in Snoqualmie Washington. Which became the \"Fat Trout Trailer Park\" where the story of the last 7 days of Laura Palmer begins.\nSince its showing at the 1992 Festival De Cannes, no other Lynch film had polarized audiences to such an extent. Fans that wanted more \"Cherry Pie\" and \"Donuts\" from the TV show were served a much darker, unflinching and unforgiving work - in Lynch's own words, a movie about \"the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim\". Derided by critics and many fans at the time it was a commercial box office flop.\nYet in the years since the initial reaction, a gradual wave of reappraisal and appreciation began. With time it's brilliance came into focus with growing acknowledgment, that the film is a more accurate, complex and powerful account of trauma. Combining the dramatic ferocity of Sherly Lee's tour de force and the beauty of Angelo Badalamenti's score, Lynch reclaimed full ownership of the material creating a harrowing, compassionate and enigmatic hymn to Laura Palmer.\nAs we approach the films 34 year anniversary and since Lynch's passing in 2025, it is now regarded by critics and fans worldwide, as a revered epilogue, essential predecessor to \"The Return\", and Lynch's most chilling, terrifying, and yet empathetic and humane cinematic masterpiece.\nWHERE: The Roxy Cinema. 5 Park Road. Miramar. Wellington.\nCinema 1 - The big cinema upstairs with the massive screen, red italian leather sofas, and of course those red curtains!\nWHEN: Wed 25th Feb 2026.

And then you'd burst into fire\" - Laura Palmer\n\nTWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME.\n\nDAVID LYNCH | USA & FRANCE | 1992 | 135mins | R18+| 4K DCP PROVIDED BY JANUS FILMS DISTRIBUTION\n\nJoin us for this very special community fundraiser screening of the prequel to the critically acclaimed series, \"Twin Peaks\".\n\nABC cancelled the original series after season 2 but a month later, Lynch announced he was \"not yet finished with the material\" and principal photography for the full length prequel film, began on September 5th 1991 at a caravan site in Snoqualmie Washington. Which became the \"Fat Trout Trailer Park\" where the story of the last 7 days of Laura Palmer begins.\n\nSince its showing at the 1992 Festival De Cannes, no other Lynch film had polarized audiences to such an extent. Fans that wanted more \"Cherry Pie\" and \"Donuts\" from the TV show were served a much darker, unflinching and unforgiving work - in Lynch's own words, a movie about \"the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim\". Derided by critics and many fans at the time it was a commercial box office flop.\n\nYet in the years since the initial reaction, a gradual wave of reappraisal and appreciation began. With time it's brilliance came into focus with growing acknowledgment, that the film is a more accurate, complex and powerful account of trauma. Combining the dramatic ferocity of Sherly Lee's tour de force and the beauty of Angelo Badalamenti's score, Lynch reclaimed full ownership of the material creating a harrowing, compassionate and enigmatic hymn to Laura Palmer.\n\nAs we approach the films 34 year anniversary and since Lynch's passing in 2025, it is now regarded by critics and fans worldwide, as a revered epilogue, essential predecessor to \"The Return\", and Lynch's most chilling, terrifying, and yet empathetic and humane cinematic masterpiece.\n\nWHERE: The Roxy Cinema. 5 Park Road. Miramar. Wellington.\n\nCinema 1 - The big cinema upstairs with the massive screen, red italian leather sofas, and of course those red curtains!\n\nWHEN: Wed 25th Feb 2026.

    "long_description": "Rethinking Careers: From 9 to 5 to Thrive\n\nWhat if thriving at work isn\u2019t about doing more \u2014 but about expressing who you already are?\n\nThis event explores how meaningful work emerges when we understand our natural temperament and disposition. According to the Career Dharma framework, each person is wired to create value in a particular way \u2014 driven by distinct motivations, values, and strengths.\n\nThis natural orientation is known as your field of work.\n\nRather than starting with job titles, Career Dharma identifies four archetypal fields of work, drawn from timeless wisdom about human nature:\n\nIdeas \u2013 teaching, guiding, researching, healing\n\nGovernment \u2013 organising, protecting, leading\n\nArtistry \u2013 creating beauty, sensing emotion, responding to needs\n\nResources \u2013 building, managing, sustaining, and sharing value\n\nWhen we work within the field that matches our nature, work feels purposeful and sustainable. When we don\u2019t, even \u201csuccessful\u201d careers can lead to burnout or inner conflict.\n\nThrough guided exercises and reflection, you\u2019ll:\n\nIdentify your natural field of work\n\nUnderstand what genuinely motivates and drains you\n\nSee why certain roles feel heavy \u2014 and others feel more alive\n\nConnect your disposition to real-world roles and possible pathways\n\nThis session isn\u2019t just about fixing your career. It\u2019s about learning the language of your own nature, and letting that understanding quietly guide what comes next.\n\nPlease note this is one of two careers workshops this month. While they complement each other, each session is designed to be meaningful on its own.\n\nA plant-based dinner and dessert are included in your ticket.\nBoth hosts are available to support participants who wish to explore their career path further.\n\nMeet your hosts, Sri Jiva & Chanchala\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\nChanchala studied psychology and education and brings a coaching-based approach to career exploration. She supports people to uncover work they love by helping them understand what truly nourishes their nature and psychology. Chanchala\u2019s work is grounded in curiosity, self-trust, and creating careers that feel sustainable and life-giving.",

We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is co-creative and participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. There is no audience, everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event that alcohol is not permitted. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page. The less cars driving the better.\nFeel free to share the event page and send an event invite to whomever you feel would be interested, not everyone sees the notifications and advertising ",

Lear\u2019s reckless division of his kingdom and Gloucester\u2019s misplaced trust in her children reveal how pride and blindness can devastate generations. Performed as the sun sets on a summer evening\u2014with the adjacent school hall ready should the weather turn\u2014this production offers a fresh perspective on parental folly, loyalty, and love, making Shakespeare\u2019s timeless themes resonate anew.\nThe show will be presented to a seated audience in the school courtyard. It can get chilly so wrap warmly but it will move indoors in poor weather. There is a bar (cash or Eftpos). Parking in the school grounds accessible from Oroua Street.\nWarning: The play contains graphic violence.",

    "long_description": "Ludovico Einaudi\nSunday 1 February 2026\nMichael Fowler Centre\nThe world\u2019s most popular classical music composer, Italian pianist, Ludovico Einaudi, returns to Australia and New Zealand this January with his new album The Summer Portraits.\nHe has performed on an Arctic ice-floe for Greenpeace and has seen his music become the soundtrack for Oscar and Golden Globe winning films ('Les Intouchables', 'Nomadland', 'The Father') and TikTok phenomena (his 2012 track 'Experience' exploded on the app) alike. From his earliest work composing for theatre and ballet in the 1980s to his multi-million-selling albums like 'In a Time Lapse' and his popular soundtracks across film and television, Einaudi has drawn upon neo-classical, pop, ambient, rock and experimental styles to create a sound that crosses boundaries and generations, becoming the world\u2019s best known \u2013 and most streamed \u2013 classical music artist in the process.\nIn January 2025, Einaudi released 'The Summer Portraits'. The record is a lush return to full-band textures and is the result of a cascade of personal memories triggered by sun, summer and family holidays. On his last Australian tour, before a gig at the Sydney Opera House, Einaudi sat down and started composing the single 'Rose Bay', based on his sense impressions of the bay his grandfather made home.\nDon\u2019t miss your chance to experience the world\u2019s most popular contemporary classical artist.

    "long_description": "Transvision Vamp announce first New Zealand tour in 31 years!\nBritish pop rock band Transvision Vamp are bringing their hits down under for the first time in almost three decades. With shows in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch lined up for February 2026, the group will be playing their nostalgia-filled favourites.\n\u200d\nFormed in 1986, Transvision Vamp quickly rose to fame. Their songs 'Baby I Don\u2019t Care', 'Revolution Baby', 'I Want Your Love', 'The Only One' and 'If Looks Could Kill' all hit the Top 50 in the New Zealand singles chart from 1988 - 1991. Wendy James, the lead singer and focal point of the group, attracted media attention with her sexually charged and rebellious image.\n\nTransvision Vamp became known for their collision of brash punk and commercial pop, and joining James on this tour are some musical luminaries: Alex Ward (The Thurston Moore Group) on guitar, Dave Parsons (Transvision Vamp) on bass, and James Sclavunos (Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds) on drums.\n\nWendy James went on to pursue a successful solo career spanning an additional seven studio albums, including a notable collaboration with Elvis Costello. She served as a feminist symbol in the 80\u2019s for unapologetic self-expression and fearless leadership.\n\nJames says, \"I am so very excited to be coming back to New Zealand to play the songs which started my whole musical journey! I remember vividly so many incredible moments gigging in New Zealand, moments of enormous success, enormous love and enormous fun. I\u2019m bringing with me a set full of music that will thrill and musicians who will amaze!\"",

We then hold a garage sale where all items big or small sell for a gold coin each. All proceeds are then donated to a charity that's helps out the community (this years charity is yet to be determined). This helps out the community fourfold. People get to declutter, people get what they need at a a very low price, a charity gets a financial donation and we reduce the items going to the landfill.\nWe will start collecting items for the garage sale from the 7th of January so if you have something you believe would be suitable flick us an email with photos to .

    "long_description": "We often believe we can know something about other people based on what we see of their bodies. Before we\u2019re even conscious of it, we label, compartmentalise or judge - and it can be a real struggle to relish our own bodies when this judgment happens in front of a mirror. \nThe Stories of Our Bodies is an affirming and liberating circle, firmly\nheld in dignity, that redirects this judgement towards positive body image and bodily autonomy. This workshop builds on the living lineage of Australian Radical Faerie elder Uncle Teacosy. It is shaped from gay men\u2019s survival of the 90\u2019s AIDS epidemic, evolved to uplift queer&trans communities and has been offered internationally by only one facilitator.\nEach participant is invited into deep connection with their body and then in turn, we share the stories of our bodies from birth til now, removing as many articles of clothing as we choose. Stories often include histories of illness, injury, gender affirmation, addiction, aging, intentional modification, shape, ability or size\nWhat stories can the marks and folds of a body tell when witnessed in belonging and respect? How can we uplift each story and every storyteller?\nThis circle is for participants from the Takat\u0101pui, MVPFAFF+, LGBTQIA+ communities, active in engaged consent and includes partial or full nudity in a non-sexual atmosphere.\nYour Facilitators: Eleven Greenstones and val smith\nEleven Greenstones (she/they, Pakeha) is a cultural worker, community educator, researcher, gardener and facilitator who seeks deep and fertile justice by cultivating rich soil and robust, adaptive communities. For three decades, Eleven has informed and performed behind a radio desk, on stage, in community centres and cultural hubs. Her work spans the Pacific Ocean including in Aotearoa, Australia, Timor Leste, China, Korea, Mongolia and the US: educating in high schools, AOD rehabs, hospitals, police stations, co-housing cooperatives, squatted warehouses, international language schools and mentoring in arts workshops and community gardens.\nEleven is a life-long student, recently in decolonial Fieldwork with Leah Manaema Avene and with H\u00e9ctor Aristiz\u00e1bal, founder of ImaginAction. They\u2019ve studied post-activism with fugitive philosopher Bayo Akomolafe, Generative Somatics and Undoing Racism\u00ae (People\u2019s Institute for Survival and Beyond). They\u2019ve been mentored by First Nations ecologists to work for a living planet, Undoing White Supremacy Austin (Texas) to design and deliver anti-racism \u2018unlearning circles\u2019 and by Radial Faerie elders to facilitate liberating spaces for the LGBTQIA+ community.\nval smith (P\u0101keh\u0101, they/them) is a choreographic artist-researcher and educator based in T\u0101maki Makaurau, Aotearoa. Their practice engages critical somatics and friendship-based collaboration to explore the socio-political dimensions of whiteness, queerness, and transness within the cultural context of Aotearoa. Recent performance work investigates more-than-human kinship, queer intimacies, and temporalities in relationship with marginal urban places.\nval\u2019s teaching and facilitation engages with community, secondary and tertiary learning environments. They have a Postgraduate Diploma in Dance and Drama Secondary Teaching, and have worked with kids, young people with disabilities, the Disability dance sector, older folks, as well as queer and trans communities. They teach somatic practices, improvisation, performance skills, critical dance, yoga, creative practice and research methodologies.\nA recipient of the Arts Foundation Laureate Award (2019), val was also the 2016 Caroline Plummer Fellow at Te Whare W\u0101nanga o \u014ct\u0101kou, University of Otago, where they undertook a community dance project with the local queer community.",

Seventeen of those men were executed in Wellington and 11 are buried in Karori Cemetery.  This walking tour will visit some of their graves to account their crimes, trials and convictions. It will also visit the plots of some of the victims.\n\nThe graves are unmarked and placed in remote and disparate locations making this a tour about 2.5 hours long. The route is 2.5km and requires reasonable physical fitness due to the steep terrain and unsealed paths in places.\nThe tour contains a number of adult themes and some graphic descriptions and so is not suitable for everyone.\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee). Children under 12 are free.\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nPlease note:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you on the day 1 hour before the tour starts by email and on our Facebook page. The booking fee is non-refundable.\nPlease dress appropriately for the conditions. While we do our best to guide you on a safe walking route, the ground can become slippery in places.\nSome of our walks require a moderate degree of fitness and are not suited for those with limited mobility.\nThere is only one toilet which is located by the cemetery office at the main entrance.\nIf you have purchased tickets for other people can you please pass our tour information on to them as well.\nPlease meet us at the shelter (shown as the Historic Chapel on the map at the main entrance)\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Karori Cemetery.",

Once you\u2019re confident you\u2019ll move on to your main project: a 3mm wide flat strip bracelet in either sterling silver or copper, crafted entirely by you from start to finish. Along the way, you\u2019ll learn essential jewellery making skills including measuring, texturing, soldering, shaping, and finishing.\n\nStudents are free to personalise their bangle with textures or stamped designs. This could be a simple hammered finish, decorative patterns, or meaningful words, names, dates, or poetry lines - making your bracelet truly one of a kind.\nBeginners will work with the 3mm strip provided, ensuring a rewarding project that\u2019s manageable to complete. Wider metal is much harder to form and solder, so we are learning to walk before we can run ;)\n\nCopper is included in the course fee, if you wish to work in silver you can purchase it on the day.\n\nExperienced students may choose to challenge themselves by making a wider bracelet from flat strip or by creating additional bangles in silver wire. (Please note: extra silver for wider bangles is available to purchase at the workshop for experienced students only, and let us know if you wish to go wider so we can make sure we have the strip in stock).\n\nThis workshop is a taster class: perfect for anyone seeking a fun, creative experience with a beautiful result, or for those looking to dip their toes into jewellery making and build foundational skills.",

    "long_description": "INTRODUCING AOTEAROA'S NEWEST FUNDRAISING EVENT: RETHINK\nRETHINK Fundraising 2026 invites you and your team to look at your fundraising programme from a fresh perspective.\nJoin us for a full day of inspirational talks, panel discussions and practical workshops that will leave you energised, AND armed with a toolkit of actionable learnings to take your fundraising to the next level.\nDate: Thursday, 5 March\nVenue: M\u0101karo Room, Wharewaka Function Centre\nTime: 8am-5pm\nCost: $249NZD (exc GST)*\nContact: Anna Shere anna@changeand.co\n*If you prefer to pay via invoice, please email accounts@changeand.co.\nTHE PROGRAMME\nFor those of you who joined us for RETHINK Auckland 2025, please note that RETHINK Wellington will feature many of the same sessions from that event, with a few additions to the programme and two new guest speakers.\nBranding blindspots \nIn a sector focused on campaigns, conversion, and compliance, brand is often overlooked. But brand isn\u2019t just a logo or a nice story. It\u2019s how people feel about supporting you. And if it's not clear, engaging, or modern \u2013 you\u2019re leaving both money and meaning on the table. This presentation from Tim Dove at re:brand will challenge a few norms and show some examples of it being done well. He\u2019ll get you thinking about your organisation and how you can ensure you\u2019re avoiding the \u2018brand blindspot\u2019. \nRethinking charity comms \nWhen it comes to getting people enthused about our cause, too often we focus on the what rather than the why. Worse, we risk boring our audience to death with earnest, organisation-centric communications which neither inspire nor instruct. Dominique Antarakis from Change&Co will show you a new and fun way to look at your charity comms for maximum engagement and donor retention.  \nWorkshop 1 \nFacilitated workshop which will provide the opportunity to take the learnings from the morning sessions and give you the practical branding and comms tools to take back to your organisation - and transform your fundraising! \nLunch break  \nTake a break, mix and mingle, and enjoy a fabulous lunch selection.\nData, behaviour, and hyper-personalisation \nThis presentation from MIMO/DATAM will show you how to transform raw data into meaningful, multi-channel interactions across email, SMS, voice, and direct mail - all from a single platform. This session will challenge how you think about personalisation - it\u2019s not just about names in subject lines or open rates in eDMs, it\u2019s about burning down the old school campaigns and rebuilding around behaviour, context and connection. \nLessons from the legacy frontlines \nBased on interviews with practitioners from organisations large and small, this session shares unfiltered insights from Gift in Will managers who are doing the work every day\u2014what's actually generating pledges, where they're getting stuck, and what they wish they'd known sooner. Through their collective wisdom, and guided by TEDIREX\u2019s Martin Ruane, we'll explore the biggest challenges facing legacy programs today, the opportunities hiding in plain sight, and tactical takeaways that work for both beginners and experienced practitioners. \nWorkshop 2 \nFacilitated workshop which will provide the opportunity to take the learnings from the afternoon sessions and give you the practical personalisation and AI tools to ramp up acquisition and retention.  \nCFRE ACCREDITATION\nFull participation in RETHINK Fundraising is applicable for 7 points in Category 1.B -Education of the CFRE International application for initial certification and/or recertification.\nEVENT PARTNERS\nChange&Co, DATAM, mimo, re:brand and Tedirex. Special thanks to FIA/FINZ for their support of the day.\nRETHINK has been designed by fundraisers for fundraisers, and we\u2019re keen to make sure you get the most out of the day. We promise no hard-sell, no product placement, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee.\nThe idea is for you to leave at the end of the day with a roadmap to greater donor engagement \u2013 and a sense of renewed energy for what lies ahead.",

    "long_description": "The Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra (AoJO) returns to Wellington with a contemporary re-imagining of one of the most influential works of the 20th century: George Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue. The performance takes place at Meow Nui on Thursday 6 March at 7.00pm, featuring acclaimed pianist Ben Wilcock.\n\nFirst heard in 1924, Rhapsody in Blue broke new ground by fusing jazz language with symphonic form. In this performance, AoJO honours the essence of Gershwin\u2019s original while re-examining the work through a modern big band lens \u2014 expanding its orchestral colours, rhythmic drive, and improvisational possibilities for today\u2019s audiences.\n\nAoJO Musical Director John Rae says the orchestra approached the piece with both respect and curiosity:\n\n\u201cGershwin was writing music that looked forward, not backward. Our aim with this version of Rhapsody in Blue is to treat it the same way, to honour the original while allowing it to speak in a contemporary jazz language that feels alive right now.\u201d\n\nThe performance features pianist Ben Wilcock, widely regarded as one of Aotearoa\u2019s leading jazz artists, whose international career spans Europe, the UK, and New Zealand.\n\n\u201cBen brings an incredible combination of authority, imagination, and openness to this music,\u201d says Rae. \u201cHe understands Gershwin from the inside out, and he\u2019s not afraid to take risks, which is exactly what this piece demands.\u201d\n\nWilcock has been praised internationally for his distinctive musical voice: \u201cWilcock combines dazzling technical command with a rare sense of musical narrative \u2014 his playing is both fearless and deeply expressive.\u201d \u2014 All About Jazz\n\nAnother review described him as \u201cA pianist of remarkable clarity and imagination, equally at home in classical repertoire and cutting-edge jazz.\u201d\n\nAlongside this project, AoJO continues its broader mission of developing large-ensemble jazz in Aotearoa and creating meaningful performance opportunities for local musicians.\n\n\u201cThe Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra exists to celebrate, develop, and present contemporary large-ensemble jazz in Aotearoa \u2014 supporting our musicians, engaging new audiences, and placing this music in a living cultural context rather than a museum one.\u201d\n\nEvent details\nWhat: Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra: Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue\nFeaturing: Ben Wilcock (piano)\nWhere: Meow Nui, Wellington\nWhen: Friday 6 March 2026, 7.00pm",

We're excited to be collaborating with our friends from Seeds to Feeds to bring you a great line up of local food related activities for the day. Join us for as much or as little of the day as you would like.\n\nCOMMUNITY CHUTNEY - Bring along a vegetable to add to the Community Pot (by 12:30pm). We\u2019ll forage from the m\u0101ra and together we\u2019ll make a big pot of delicious chutney.\n\nSEED SWAP - Throughout the day we will have a seed swap table set up. Feel free to pop by anytime to take some seeds home for your own m\u0101ra or bring some along to swap.\n\n9:30am - 12.30pm COMMUNITY WORKING BEE - Registrations required.\nSupport our local food by helping to grow it! Many hands make light work - come and get your hands in the m\u0101ra, learn some skills, and meet some cool people. Please register at www.kaicycle.org.nz/volunteer\n\n12:30PM - 1:30pm, KAI BREAK\nJoin us for a shared lunch and a chilled hang out in the m\u0101ra. Please bring some kai to share if you can.\n\n1:00PM - FARM TOUR\nIf you haven't been to our urban farm before, this is a great opportunity to find out what we're all about and how our farm and community composting works.\n\n1:30pm - 3.oopm KOHA WORKSHOP: INTRODUCTION TO SEED SAVING - Registration require - email to register.\nJoin us for this introductory workshop on seed saving. Seed saving is an ancient practice and an essential tool in creating a circular and resilient food system and enabling kai sovereignty. It also allows us to select for seed that will thrive in our micro-climates, strengthening crops year by year. We'll w\u0101nanga about the importance of saving seed, understanding the whakapapa of seeds and plant reproduction, and what you need to know to start saving seed yourself. We'll put our learnings into practice at the farm, saving and processing seed from our summer crops. We will have an area for swapping seed, so please bring along any saved seed you would like to swap. This is a koha workshop and we ask you to pay what you can afford. If that\u2019s a gold coin that is completely fine! If you can afford more we really appreciate it - we are a charity and rely on donations to be able to carry out our mahi. Koha can be paid in cash or by bank transfer.\nRegistrations required - email to sign up.\n\n****\nAny p\u0101tai? Email\n\n",

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating.

This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us.

The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect.

A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad.

He believes music only really happens when he is fully living, pushing into new environments, meeting people and adding what he calls seasoning to life. \nThe album was written and recorded between Aotearoa and Berlin, with production by Djeisan Suskov, Justyn Pilbrow and Josh Fountain, and featuring Len Blake and keyboard virtuoso Joe Kaptein. \nMuroki is immersed in the Berlin scene, regularly jamming with musicians including members of Parcels, Rikas and the Zen Men, finding grounding in a city that can be both electric and mellow. He filmed the video for latest single Break It Down in Portugal with director Ezra Simons (Earth Tongue), shot entirely on 16mm film in Peniche and Nazar\u00e9, and also returned to Kenya for the first time since he was sixteen, reconnecting with wh\u0101nau and gaining perspective during this chapter.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been bouncing between places while working on this album. Living nomadically keeps me open and curious. Nothing beats coming back to Aotearoa, and I can\u2019t wait to play these songs live with the band.\u201d\nWith platinum success on Wavy, the Triple J topping Love Cocoon with BENEE and collaborations with LEISURE, Young Franco and NASAYA, Muroki returns home ready to take these songs to the stage.",

The huge contribution of Dr Karen Grylls is celebrated in \u2018Ara Hura \u2014 A Visionary Journey\u2019. \nIt\u2019s fitting that this Aotearoa Festival of the Arts concert involves the choir Dr Grylls founded 28 years ago. Voices New Zealand debuted with a concert at the same festival in 1998. It has gone on to build a reputation for excellence in the music world. For this celebratory concert, the choir is joined by taonga p\u016boro artist Horomona Horo, leading instrumentalists, and a chamber ensemble from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. \nThe concert centrepiece is Robert Wiremu\u2019s Re-imagined Mozart: Erebus. The programme also features a new commission from Takerei Komene, as well as waiata by Ng\u0101p\u014d and Pimia Wehi. This highlights Dr Grylls\u2019 pioneering collaborations that reshaped Aotearoa\u2019s choral landscape. Her expertise as a choral clinician is sought internationally, and she regularly conducts masterclasses and workshops in Wales, England, North America, Canada and Australia. \nThis marks Dr Grylls\u2019 final appearance as Music Director of Voices New Zealand. It\u2019s a rare opportunity to celebrate her vision, artistry, and legacy.",

    "long_description": "EC-MENz vision is for men fully participating at all levels of Early Childhood Education to represent the diversity of our society in Aotearoa.\nThe EC-MENz Summit 2026 is kindly being hosted and supported by Childspace.\n\nT\u0101ne, w\u0101hine, and irawhiti are warmly invited to participate in a special day of high quality, affordable professional learning. This celebration of gender diversity in ECE will be held in a safe and supportive environment and is a fantastic opportunity to meet others in the profession, share your own story, and be inspired.\nGender Steretoypes in ECE - Mike Collin and Max Christie\nWhat can gender stereotypes teach us about teaching and learning?\nEarly childhood education relies on diversity within teaching teams. Yet, gender stereotypes often shape how we see ourselves and each other as kaiako. This interactive session invites educators to explore the hidden assumptions that influence teaching roles and team dynamics. In this session, Max and Mike will unpack how stereotypes impact collaboration and how every kaiako adds unique value to teaching teams. Participants will leave with practical strategies to challenge bias, strengthen team culture, and celebrate the richness of varied approaches in ECE settings.\nMike Collin (B. Ed)\nBeing a new grad, Mike harnesses a fresh perspective underpinned by recent research and hands on learning. Mike is currently a kaiako within Heretaunga Kindergarten Association, nurturing the lives of our future generations to come.\nMike changed career paths having found his passion for teaching young tamariki. He believes in kaiako being the best versions of themselves to enhance positive and\nmeaningful learning environments for tamariki, advocating for the professionalism which early childhood kaiako achieve everyday. Mike strives for excellence in his approach to teaching and learning, seeking out the best outcomes for tamariki.\nMax Christie (M. Ed)\nMax brings over a decade of experience in early childhood education, blending academic expertise with hands-on leadership. Max currently lectures at EIT Te Aho a M\u0101ui, where he inspires future educators through a commitment to quality ECE for tamariki and wh\u0101nau.\nHe began his teaching journey at Childspace Northland, where he also gained leadership experience and has facilitated PLD internationally and across Aotearoa. Max is deeply passionate about nature-based education, play, te ao M\u0101ori, leadership, innovative and affirming the mana of tamariki and kaiako.\nAutism NZ - Thecla Moffat\nMen can change the dynamics of play in ECE benefiting autistic tamariki\nMale kaiako often bring more energy in the ECE setting with an emphasis on more physical activity, outdoor play, \"rough and tumble\" play, and positive risk-taking, which appeals to both boys and girls and provides a different dimension to play than may be beneficial to most autistic tamariki. We now know that through fun and engaging interactions kaiako help enhance the autistic tamariki pivotal capacities for later learning. In this talk kaiako will get to know how men in ECE with their positive energy can make a difference through play for autistic tamariki in their centres. The kaiako will be given a few strategies of how to do that and some ideas to encourage tuakana-teina (peer play) between autistic tamariki and their non-autistic peers will be shared.\nThecla Moffat (Early Intervention Manager, Autism New Zealand) is an educator who has been in the teaching field for over three decades. Thecla is passionate about inclusion and advocate for children\u2019s rights and needs to be met in their educational settings.\nThecla has experience teaching from early childhood to primary school. She joined the tertiary sector in educating New Zealand\u2019s teachers between January 2013 and October 2015 working as a lecturer at New Zealand Tertiary College. In her first year at New Zealand Tertiary College, she wrote the course guide for Inclusive Education Level 7. In October 2015 she joined the New Zealand Ministry of Education as an Early Intervention Specialist. In August 2019 Thecla joined Autism New Zealand to start their new early intervention services. She has a huge interest in inclusive education for children with diverse needs and promoting emotional and social competencies in the early years with special interest in autistic children. She has done research in inclusive early childhood education and promoting children\u2019s social competencies. She sits on the Teaching Council Inclusive Education Advisory Group and currently sits on the academic programme board for New Zealand Tertiary College among other roles. She is a parent to three amazing children one of whom is neurodiverse. theclamoffat@xtra.co.nz OR thecla.moffat@autismnz.org.nz\nSelf-regulation & positive behaviour strategies - Robert Jensen & Nikki Wilson\nENGAGE is an evidence-based approach that supports the development of children\u2019s self-regulation skills through intentional play. ENGAGE was developed by Professor Dione Healey (University of Otago) and has been widely researched in Aotearoa.\nIn collaboration with Methodist Mission Southern (MMS) and funding from the Ministry of Education, the programme is now being delivered across Aotearoa to equip tamariki with self-regulation skills to support successful navigation through school and beyond.\nRobert & Nikki are ENGAGE facilitators for the Te Whanganui-a-Tara region.\nPlay is good for you! - Robin Christie\nThe reciprocal nature of learning between child and adult relies on a shared language - the language of play. This universal language is unspoken, and is strongest in the presence of curious, wondrous, joyous educators. You are already fluent in this language, and the amazing diversity of playful approaches you bring to your ECE setting is a huge strength of our profession! This entertaining and thought- provoking session will reinforce the importance of playful adults in children's learning, examine the research around the role of humour in human development, and share practical tips for staying playful every day.\nRobin Christie is an early childhood teacher, playscape designer, and the co-founder of Childspace Early Learning Centres in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Wellington, Aotearoa/ New Zealand. He is passionate about creativity in the early years, developing empowering learning environments, and getting more good men into ECE. You can get hold of him anytime on robin@childspace.nz .",

Across the album\u2019s eleven tracks, Maltese\u2019s trademark wit is still present but wielded with restraint, often emerging through self-deprecation and quiet revelation.\n\nHaving first established himself in 2018 with his debut Bad Contestant, Maltese has since evolved into one of the UK\u2019s finest young songwriters. The albums that followed cemented his reputation for transforming the mundane into something dream-like, his piano harmonies, playful lyricism and quintessentially British wit resonating around the world.\n\nIn late 2024, Maltese embarked on a headline tour across Asia, Australia and New Zealand, following sold-out runs through the US, Europe and the UK \u2013 including his biggest performances to date at The Wiltern in Los Angeles and London\u2019s Electric Brixton. With Hers, he now steps into an even bigger chapter: playing to larger rooms than ever before and connecting with an audience that continues to grow from Sydney to S\u00e3o Paulo, Jakarta to Tokyo.\n\nAudiences can expect an enchanting live experience that blends Maltese\u2019s new material with an favourites spanning his six-album catalogue \u2013 poetic, wry, and unashamedly human.\n\n",

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

The influence of his musical heroes Harry Nilsson and Randy Newman resonates again on this record, where Bret playfully weaves humour and heart into his songs. Hailed as \u201cupbeat, well-made and refreshingly smart\u201d (Daily Mirror) and \u201csuperbly crafted with a nod to the greats (God is in the TV), the record highlights Bret\u2019s evolving artistry, blending sharp lyricism, lush arrangements and his unmistakable offbeat charm.\nThe upcoming shows will feature newly-released songs alongside old favorites, plus hilarious recountings of key moments from his colorful career, songs written on the fly using audience members\u2019 real-life stories, and various other onstage antics.\nFollowing sold-out performances overseas, these intimate New Zealand dates offer a rare opportunity to experience Freak Out City live in two of Aotearoa\u2019s most beloved venues.",

    "long_description": "The \u201cMysticssippi Blues Man\u201d and one of Canada\u2019s most revered and distinctive musical voices brings his world-renowned live show to New Zealand audiences!\nHarry Manx has spent decades carving out a singular musical path. He is known for his extraordinary ability to fuse deep blues grooves with the spiritual depth of Indian classical music. Switching effortlessly between slide guitar, harmonica, banjo, and the remarkable Mohan veena \u2014 a 20-stringed instrument taught to him by Indian master Vishwa Mohan Bhatt \u2014 Manx creates performances that are immersive, transportive, and deeply human.\n\u201cA seamless fit between blues and Indian classical music\u201d - DownBeat Magazine\n\u201cDeliciously addictive\" - The New York Times\n\u201cCanada\u2019s most expressive blues player\u201d - Billboard Magazine\n\ud83d\udccd Friday 03 April @ The Little Theatre - Lower Hutt\n7pm doors / 7:30pm show\nSeated Concert\n2 x 45 minute sets with intermission\n$59 Early Bird Tickets (very limited)\nDON'T miss your chance to see live music at it's finest!\n\n\u201cWatching Harry play tonight I feel like I learned something new \u2026. \u201d\nBruce Springsteen\nHarry Manx is an artist that critics have occasionally had a hard time getting their minds around. His unique amalgam of blues and other American roots music, classical Indian forms, and bits of rock, pop, and folk makes him difficult to pigeonhole, and self-appointed gatekeepers of those traditions sometimes bemoan his lack of purity, stubbornly missing the point. But Manx\u2019s trip is really quite easy to grasp: He\u2019s an accomplished and adventurous lap-slide guitarist \u2013 whether playing a National resonator, a solidbody lap-steel, a modified banjo or cigar-box guitar, or his signature 20-string Mohan Veena \u2013 and a compelling singer with a rich, warm, and soulful voice who writes intelligent and compassionate songs and puts them over with heartfelt conviction.\u201d\nBarry Cleveland, Guitar Player Magazine\n\nThere are concerts, and then there are rare musical gatherings that feel quietly profound. Harry Manx creates the latter. This is music that doesn\u2019t rush, doesn\u2019t shout, and doesn\u2019t rely on spectacle \u2014 instead, it invites you to listen deeply, feel fully, and leave changed. Audiences don\u2019t just attend a Harry Manx show; they experience it. These nights linger long after the final note fades, becoming the kind of concert people talk about for years. If you value artistry, atmosphere, and the rare magic that happens when a room truly listens, this is a performance you\u2019ll want to be part of.",

Not only will you get the full album, but there will also be other much-loved favourites. Hear A Pair of Brown Eyes, Dirty Old Town, A Rainy Night in Soho, and plenty more. \nHelping bring this re-creation to life are original members James Fearnley, Jem Finer and Spider Stacy. There is also a special lineup of acclaimed guest vocalists, Daragh Lynch, Iona Zajac, and John Francis Flynn. Together they\u2019ll present a soul-stirring celebration of one of modern music\u2019s most enduring legacies. \nThe Pogues formed in 1982 and fused punk with traditional Irish music. They originally called themselves Pogue Mahone. This phrase is an anglicisation of the Irish for p\u00f3g mo th\u00f3in, meaning \u201ckiss my arse\u201d.",

Playing Wellington\u2019s San Fran on Saturday 11 April, followed by The Powerstation in Auckland on Sunday 12 April. \nTickets on sale Thursday 2 October 12pm from helmetmusic.com\nHelmet has built a reputation as one of the most commanding forces in the underground scene.

Be prepared to drop into a deep space.\nDoor sales will be available if there is space. Advanced booking is recommended.\n\nBetween the Worlds is an evening Sound Journey shaped by over thirty years of deep ceremonial and immersive sound practice. Blending primal rhythm, atmospheric voice, deep didgeridoo, and field recordings, the journey unfolds organically \u2014 shifting from dynamic, embodied energy into vast, cinematic stillness.\n\nThis is not passive listening.\nIt is an experience to be entered.\n\nAs sound layers, dissolve, and reform, participants are guided into a liminal space where time softens and inner landscapes awaken. The journey becomes a passage \u2014 one that listeners don\u2019t just hear, but inhabit.\n\nGuided by the myth of the Wandering Forest Spirit, Between the Worlds invites a reconnection with self, with nature, and with something older than language. Ceremonial, immersive, and deeply evocative, this is an evening to slow down, listen deeply, and cross into the unseen.\nIt's like a soundtrack that is crafted to go with your life.\n\nSika's Sound Journeys are truly unique. They are sonic explorations that feature didgeridoos, drums, flutes, voice and orchestral elements. A collection of foraged sounds from objects he has recorded in nature, add even more textures. Many of his sounds are completely unrecognisable and abstract. Immersed in this cocoon of abstract sound, we can find ourselves in the most surprising places in our mind. In this timeless realm, beyond the normal limitations of rational reality, anything is possible.\nAn epic adventure deep inside yourself.\nJourney to worlds within worlds on incredible sound waves.\n\nSika creates a safe space to relax deeply and connect with our inner guidance. This Sound Journey begins and ends with a short guided visualisation.\nThere will be two journeys with an interval. Most people choose to lie down, so bring a yoga mat, pillow and blanket and get really comfortable.\nA journal is also recommended.\n\n",

    "long_description": "She\u2019s a comedian boasting stage, television, and podcast success. Joanne McNally heads to The Opera House in Wellington for a new stage show. Pinotphile displays the Irish comic\u2019s wry wit and sense of the absurd. Hailed by Variety as One to Watch, McNally has been keeping herself busy since her last tour by ruining men\u2019s lives (and her own). For Pinophile, she\u2019s still single, still unfertilised, and laden with irreverent, ridiculous and hilarious war stories. Join Joanne for a wild ride as she navigates situationships, revenge, frenemies and rejection. The Irish Examiner describes her trademark style as \u2018joyously nuts\u2019. \nYou may have come across Joanne as a co-host of the award-winning podcast My Therapist Ghosted Me. She\u2019s also had riotous appearances on Taskmaster, The Jonathan Ross Show and The Big Fat Quiz of Everything.",

    "long_description": "Evening Tour\nWould you like to join us and explore the beauty of Karori Cemetery in the evening?\nThis tour is for anyone who would like to see the Cemetery through a different lens, as the landscape settles in from dusk to darkness. On this walk you'll be accompanied by two guides who will take you on a wander through some of the most magical parts of the cemetery, with a story or two of early Wellingtonians along the route. We might even spy a Ruru/Morepork or two! The tour does not have any scary themes. There are points on the tour where we may pause and turn off our torches to enjoy the landscape in the darkness.\nThe tour is of approximately 1.5 hours duration and starts and finishes at the Main Chapel on Rosehaugh Avenue, where there is plenty of easy parking.\nEach attendee needs to bring their own torch that they can comfortably carry for the duration. No head torches please for the comfort of your fellow walkers.\nThe route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. Surefootedness is required. This tour involves approximately 2km of walking, with some slow paced but uphill stints.\nThe tour is not suited for children under the age of 12 or unaccompanied minors. There are no toilets on the route.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee).\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nPlease note:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you on the day 1 hour before the tour starts by email and on our Facebook page. The booking fee is non-refundable.\nPlease dress appropriately for the conditions. While we do our best to guide you on a safe walking route, the ground can become slippery in places.\nSome of our walks require a moderate degree of fitness and are not suited for those with limited mobility.\nIf you have purchased tickets for other people can you please pass our tour information on to them as well.\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Karori Cemetery.",

    "long_description": "Mozart Requiem\nExperience two masterpieces in one exceptional concert as Orpheus Choir Wellington present Christopher Tin\u2019s To Shiver the Sky alongside Mozart\u2019s Requiem. This concert spans five centuries of imagination and purpose, from the earliest dreams of flight to one of the greatest choral masterpieces ever written.\n\nTo Shiver the Sky is an epic choral spectacular from Grammy winning composer Christopher Tin. Drawing on texts from da Vinci, Hildegard von Bingen, Ovid, Jules Verne, Amelia Earhart and John F. Kennedy, it builds a sweeping musical history of human flight from imagined wings to the Moon landing. Born from a record breaking Kickstarter campaign, the work opens with Sogno di Volare, known worldwide as the main theme of Civilization VI, one of the most celebrated strategy games of the decade. Its sound world spans luminous stillness and immense choral climaxes, evoking the exhilaration and peril of human flight.\n\nMozart\u2019s Requiem stands as one of the greatest choral works ever composed. Written in the final months of his life, it sets the sacred Requiem Mass with blazing dramatic power and a depth of feeling that has captivated audiences for more than two centuries. From the fierce energy of the Dies Irae to the aching beauty of the Lacrimosa, the music moves with a haunting power that remains unmatched in the choral repertoire.\n\nTogether these works form an extraordinary musical journey. One celebrates the daring that pushes humanity forward. The other reveals the full dramatic power of the Requiem tradition at its most intense and expressive. Performed by the mighty Orpheus Choir Wellington with Orchestra Wellington, conducted by Brent Stewart and featuring celebrated soprano Emma Pearson, this is a night of immense musical colour and emotional impact.\n\n",

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

Now, to celebrate the release of his brand new album Later Than You Think, the synth-tastic American songwriter with the unmistakable baritone is headed to New Zealand for two extraordinary shows next May. Brought to you by Banished Music and Strange News, Mr Maus is set to make good on a long-held promise.\n\nIn 2019, after a series of personal tragedies and the stresses of touring his high-intensity show left Maus feeling unable to perform here, he flew home urgently to recover, with shows here cancelled at short notice. Now, with five years of contemplation, retreat and recuperation, and time spent crafting his new record, John Maus is set to make his return.\n\nThroughout his long career, Maus considered himself to have been \u201cconstantly fighting the status quo: the Mickey Mouse Club, Coca-Cola, and all the institutions that reduce culture to its lowest common denominator\u201d. Then, in 2020, he was infamously photographed at the January 6 riots, and was himself promptly \u201ccancelled\u201d.\n\nIn hindsight, he says, he now knows he should have been a lot clearer about his ethos and political beliefs in the wake of it all. \u201cI thought my legacy would speak for itself,\u201d Maus told Stereogum in a recent interview. Stating he was only at the protest to shoot footage for a new documentary film alongside film-maker Alex Moyer, these days he realises he ought to have stated his position a lot more bluntly. \u201cI should have been clearer that I\u2019m absolutely against Trumpism,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as forthright a denunciation as it should have been.\u201d\n\nPowered by \u201cgenuine emotion and radical sincerity\u201d, the new album includes I Hate Antichrist, a song Maus describes as a sort of sequel to Cop Killer, and features a secular Gregorian chant that embraces French philosopher Alain Badiou\u2019s anti-xenophobic sentiment that \u201cAll the people who are here are from here\u201d.\n\nFrom the death of ego and descent into madness, this is a party we\u2019re all invited to.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Day 1 \u2013 May 10, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: Working with Dissociative Parts and Their Voices in Complex Trauma and Dissociative Disorders\nOverview:\nThis seminar focuses on adapting EMDR for individuals with dissociative disorders, using the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) Dolores has developed. It provides strategies for working with dissociative parts and their voices and integrating a trauma-informed approach to inner conflict safely from early treatment stages.\nKey Learning Points:\n\u00b7         Identifying and working with dissociative parts and their voices.\n\u00b7         Understanding the function and purpose of \u201chostile\u201d parts.\n\u00b7         Addressing dissociative phobias through EMDR informed techniques.\n\u00b7         Managing resistance and treatment impasses.\n\u00b7         Structuring work with dissociative parts effectively.\nProgram Description:\nAfter many early cautions about the potential dangers of using EMDR with individuals suffering from dissociative disorders, limited methods have been offered for adapting standard EMDR procedures to this specific population. Based on these early cautions, EMDR is still considered by many clinicians as limited to the treatment of traumatic memories in high-functioning dissociative clients and only after a long preparation phase that depends on other treatment modalities. Confined by this conceptualisation, the use of EMDR is too often limited, and many survivors of severe traumatisation are unable to benefit from EMDR reprocessing and, if at all, only much later in the treatment process.\nDolores Mosquera developed (with AnabelGonzalez, M.D.) the Progressive Approach model for treating complex trauma and dissociation (2012) and the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) (2019, 2025). Using this trauma and AIP-informed models, clinicians can safely utilise a wide range of EMDR interventions (including BLS) from early in the preparatory phase of treatment for patients with dissociative disorders.\nIn this seminar, she will present her current practice of working with clients, including video demonstrations. Mosquera's deft clinical skills and ground-breaking innovative thinking teach a middle ground between \"dissociation blind\" aggressive EMDR interventions and overly cautious delays to the use of EMDR reprocessing.\nMany dissociative clients have difficulty with hostile, critical voices. The internal conflict is sometimes so intense that the person even has difficulty carrying on an ordinary conversation. One factor that affects this conflict is how the patient deals with the voices or parts of the self.\nKey Program Content:\nIdentify the internal system of dissociation and internal voices that are hostile and critical\nHow to read the function and purpose behind the saboteur parts of self\nUsing compassion and understanding to help deal with dissociative phobias within the internal system\nSkills to reduce impasses and resistance that may complicate or reduce the efficacy of the treatment\nSpecific steps to organize the work with hostile parts and voices\n Days 2\u20133 \u2013 May 11\u201312, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: From Fragmentation to Integration: A Master Class in Treating Complex Trauma and Dissociation\nFormat: 2-Day Masterclass: Three Clinical Cases from Start to Finish\nAcross two days, Dolores will present three distinct new cases illustrating varying levels of dissociation \u2014 including one with frequent switching and no initial Adult Self. Each session is interactive, highlighting the therapeutic process from assessment to completion.\nOver two immersive days, this advanced master class offers a rare opportunity to observe and analyse complete therapeutic processes under the expert guidance of Dolores Mosquera.\n\nDolores will present three new and distinct clinical cases, each representing different manifestations of complex trauma and dissociation \u2014 including one client who experiences frequent switching and begins therapy without an integrated adult self.\nParticipants will follow these clients\u2019 journeys from the initial stages of therapy through to treatment completion, gaining deep insight into decision-making, pacing, and the integration of EMDR strategies within complex systems. The format is designed to be highly interactive and reflective, combining video demonstrations, live commentary, and group discussion to deepen understanding of safe, flexible, and attuned clinical practice when working with dissociative clients.\nThis master class is ideal for clinicians seeking to refine their skills, expand their conceptual framework, and enhance clinical confidence when navigating the challenges of trauma-related dissociation.\nAdditional Details\n\u00b7         Eligibility: Must have completed at least Part One of EMDR Basic Training (University of Otago or equivalent).\n\u00b7         Certification: Participants receive a Professional Development Certificate of Attendance.\n\u00b7         Dietary needs: Provided upon registration.\n\u00b7         Parking: Paid on-site parking available.\n\u00b7         Accommodation: Discounted rates at a local Musuem hotel\nTo access your special rates please visit: https://www.independentcollection.com.au/\nSelect your hotel, enter your dates and number of guests and click 'Check Rooms'\nClick \u2018I have a code\u2019\nIn the \u2018Corporate ID\u2019 field enter your booking code: MOSQUERA\nClick \u2018UPDATE\u2019\nYour special rates will appear on the rates screen\nThese rates are available for stays between 07/05/2026 and 15/08/2026 .",

We launched the expanded event last year to ensure the issues we cover are relevant and pertinent to the nation\u2019s most pressing challenges. In 2026, this is more critical than ever, as the general election looms. We need to make digital connectivity and equity front-and-centre of political debate, economic prosperity, and social wellbeing. The decisions made this year will lock in New Zealand\u2019s digital trajectory for the rest of the decade.\n\nThis year, we are proposing that the Summit tackles the crucial question: \u201cHow do we get everyone connected to the best broadband service that meets their needs to live and thrive in our digital future by 2030?\u201d\n\nThis ambitious national goal demands immediate, coordinated action from policymakers, industry, and community leaders. Join us as we delve into the critical issues surrounding digital connectivity in Aotearoa, directly influencing the next government\u2019s mandate. At this early stage, we are proposing that our sub-themes include:\n\nPolicy & Political Mandate: Developing the definitive roadmap for universal connectivity ahead of the 2026 election, securing cross-party commitment to the 2030 target.\n\nRural Connectivity: Bridging the digital divide and ensuring resilient, future-proof access for all, regardless of location.\n\nAffordability & Digital Equity: Examining the total cost barriers (device, data, skills) to internet access and advancing practical solutions for true inclusion.\n\nFuture-Proofing Connectivity: Looking ahead to emerging technologies and innovative, sustainable solutions that will make the 2030 target a reality.\n\nThese are all critical to us meeting our vision that by 2030, everyone in Aotearoa is connected to the best broadband service that meets their needs. This prospectus outlines how you can partner with this Summit to influence the national agenda and help us address the question around how we connect all of Aotearoa.\nThe Minister for Media and Communications, Hon Paul Goldsmith, is confirmed to present the closing Ministerial address.\nPlatinum Partner for 2026:",

I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training.

    "long_description": "Meet Getdown Services \u2013 your new favourite band and one of the UK\u2019s hottest word-of-mouth acts! The brilliantly offbeat cult British duo has been turning heads across Britain and Europe with their balls-to-the-walls live shows, tongue-in-cheek wit, razor-sharp lyrics and infectious disco-fuelled grooves, teetering between chaos and genius. And now, after selling out tours across the UK and Europe, they\u2019re bringing their riotous show down under for the first time in May/June 2026 \u2013 with shows in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Wellington, presented by I OH YOU and MG Live. \nTickets go on sale Friday 14 November at 10.00am local time, with MG Live presale commencing Thursday 13 November at 10.00am local time. Sign up for early access to the MG Live presale here.               \n\u201cI reckon we get people asking us to come to Australia probably every day, and everyone in England is moving there, so will be good to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\u201cAlways been one of those places where you\u2019re like, \u2018Fair enough, but I can\u2019t be arsed with that. It looks mad \u2013 there\u2019s snakes and also it takes 40 hours to get there.\u2019 Will be good fun, though! Went to New Zealand to see a mate of ours get married a few years ago and thought it was a lovely country and I really liked those pies they have. It felt quite similar to the UK in a lot of ways, so playing gigs there should be fun!\u201d\nGetdown Services\n\nFor those in the know, Bristol-based duo Josh Law and Ben Sadler \u2013 aka Getdown Services \u2013 are THE must-see new act of the year. And if you don\u2019t know yet, you will soon \u2026 and you\u2019ll wish you got in early! Named as \u201cone to watch\u201d at this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival and dubbed (by the band themselves) \u201cBritain\u2019s Best Band\u201d, their live shows are equal parts smart, sweaty and gloriously unhinged. Their sound is a wild blend of scrappy indie disco, twisted funk and post-punk energy, turning the absurdity of modern Britain into dancefloor gold.        \n \nThe pair met at school in Minehead, Somerset and now make music together at home in Bristol \u2013 churning out what Rolling Stone called \u201cpower disco with unrepentant silliness\u201d with a healthy dose of satire and swagger. Their highly lauded debut album Crisps (Breakfast Records, 2023) showcased their eclectic danceable grooves and biting social commentary, and a mix of sharp, funny social observations wrapped in irresistible, funk-fuelled rhythms. Follow-up EPs Your Medal\u2019s In The Post, Crumbs and latest, Primordial Slot Machine, cemented their cult status, alongside an arsenal of red-hot singles \u2013 including James Bay\u2019s Hat, Dog Dribble, I Got Views and Eat Quiche, Sleep, Repeat.   \n \n \u201cGetdown Services are unrepentantly silly and constantly deliver one of the most joyously deranged live shows \u2013 just one of the best live bands out there!\u201d\n Rolling Stone\n\u201cTheir live show is as daft and as exhilarating as they come. Five stars.\u201d\n Buzz Magazine\n \n \u201cGenuine contenders to being the most exciting and interesting band in the UK right now.\u201d\n CLASH\n\n Getdown Services look set to gobble up the world, one crumb at a time. Whether you\u2019re into danceable chaos, satirical genius or just want to be ahead of the curve, Getdown Services are the band you didn\u2019t know you needed \u2013 until now!

The World Health Organisation has identified that as the baby boomer generation ages, many will enjoy reasonable physical health, however mental health issues, in particular depression and anxiety, will be a prevalent health issue. Therefore promoting mental wellbeing must be a major focus for those working with older people.\nA older person's sense of wellbeing is determined by proven social, economic and cultural factors that either positively or negatively impact on older people. It is much broader than a wellness approach. How best to address factors such as loneliness, diminishing physical health, income and food security, significant loss, elder abuse, the invisibility of older people, cultural alienation and impacts of rural to urban migration and immigration from the Pacific Islands in the 1950's and 60's using a wellbeing framework will be a focus of the workshops.\nHowever, while promoting wellbeing is an effective strategy in mitigating the impact of mood and anxiety disorders in older people, it should not be the primary aim of wellbeing promotion. The emphasis must be on ageing well and thriving elders.\nHear from an experienced wellbeing specialist who has lectured and implemented numerous wellbeing programmes at the local, national and international levels.\nOver recent years there has been a greater awareness of the fundamental role that wellbeing plays in enabling individuals and communities to thrive. Take the opportunity to learn how older peoples' workers and agencies can put wellbeing at the heart of what they do that enables older people to thrive. This workshop provides a comprehensive overview of the research, evidence and latest international thinking on promoting wellbeing in older people as applied to the Aotearoa-New Zealand context\nWell elders: thriving through participating and contributing\nInformed by social, cultural and environmental determinants, adopting a wellbeing framework enable workers and agencies to identify how they can be \"agents of wellbeing\" for older people and how to incorporate wellbeing outcomes into their work. Based on these determinants and frameworks it is possible to develop an evidence-based programme logic with clear wellbeing outcomes and indicators and evaluation tools. An overview of the determinants and outcomes will be covered in the workshop.\nMental wellbeing is not just the responsibility of the health sector, the workshop is ideal training for anyone working with older people in:\naged care facilities\nchurches\ncommunity based older people agencies\nlocal government\nolder persons' mental health services\nprimary health care\nThe training does not offer a ready-made older peoples' wellbeing package but rather helps participants to:\nunderstand the underlying theory, principles and best practice in promoting mental wellbeing,\nidentify the enablers and disablers of wellbeing in older people,\nto move from an outputs to outcomes focus in designing wellbeing programmes or activities\n\nTAYLORMADE TRAINING AND CONSULTING IS PROUD TO BE AN AGE CONCERN DIGNITY CHAMPION \nTAKING A STAND AGAINST AGEISM AND PROMOTING POSITIVE AGEING",

    "long_description": "It\u2019s a stage show that covers vast rivers of galaxies in the cosmos, the ecosystems of Earth, and the structure of the human brain. Emergence is the latest show by English physicist, presenter, and personality Professor Brian Cox. He takes to the stage at TSB Arena to contemplate the dazzling complexity of the universe and how it\u2019s built on profoundly simple principles. \nEmergence is also a scientific history of 400 years of human discovery. How did we come to understand so much about the cosmos? Guided by mathematics, curiosity, and an aesthetic sense of symmetry, our species has begun to read the story of the Universe. We\u2019ve started to carry our spacecraft to the edge of the solar system and outwards to the stars. Brian\u2019s engaging style makes these questions come to life. The audience will be left awestruck and thrilled as the show covers vast topics in an accessible way. \nBrian has appeared in many landmark science programs for BBC radio and television over the last 15 years, from the Peabody Award-winning Wonders of the Solar System to the worldwide hit series The Planets. His previous touring show, Horizons, was performed to nearly half a million people across the world.",

It follows Figaro and his bride-to-be, Susannah, on their wedding day. Figaro\u2019s employer, Count Almaviva, tries to seduce Susanna, so the engaged couple seek revenge. The cast boasts an unbelievable wealth of talent from Aotearoa and Australia, including runner-up at the 2022 Lexus Song Quest Felicity Tompkins, Julien Van Mellaerts, and James Clayton. \nTrans-Tasman creative duo Lindy Hume and Tracy Grant Lord take the helm with direction and design while Orchestra Wellington and conductor James Judd lead from the pit.

    "long_description": "Widely regarded as one of the foremost songwriters of her generation, Suzanne Vega emerged as a leading figure of the folk revival of the early 1980s. Four decades later, she is still writing and singing great songs. In her Wellington show, Suzanne will perform a career-spanning set. See her on stage at St James Theatre performing favourites like Tom\u2019s Diner, Luka, Marlene On The Wall, and plenty more. There\u2019ll also be new songs from her 2025 album, \u2018Flying with Angels\u2019. Joining her on stage will be longtime guitarist, Gerry Leonard, and cellist Stephanie Winters. \nSince the release of her self-titled, critically acclaimed 1985 debut album, Suzanne Vega has played to sold-out concerts across the world. She is a masterful storyteller who, according to one The New York Times critique, \u201cobserves the world with a clinically poetic eye.\u201d Her song lyrics often focus on city life, ordinary people, and real-world subjects. They are notably succinct, understated, and immediately recognisable.",

generation, Suzanne Vega emerged as a leading figure of the folk revival of the early 1980s. Accompanying herself on acoustic guitar, Vega sang what has been called contemporary folk or neo-folk songs of her own creation in Greenwich Village clubs. Since the release of her self-titled, critically acclaimed 1985 debut album, she has given sold-out concerts in many of the world\u2019s best-known venues. Known for performances that convey deep emotion, Vega\u2019s distinctive, \u201cclear, unwavering voice\u201d (Rolling Stone) has been described as \u201ca cool, dry sandpaper-brushed near-whisper\u201d by The Washington Post, with NPR Music noting that she \u201chas been making vital, inventive music\u201d throughout the course of her decades-long career. Bearing the stamp of a masterful storyteller who \u201cobserves the world with a clinically poetic eye\u201d (The New York Times), Vega\u2019s songs have tended to focus on city life, ordinary people and real-world subjects.

    "long_description": "Presented by: Destroy All Lines\nPioneers of the iconic Madchester sound, the Happy Mondays are heading back to New Zealand to celebrate the 35th anniversary of their seminal album, Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches.\nFusing funk, rock, psychedelia, and house with the pulsating energy of the UK\u2019s burgeoning rave scene, the Happy Mondays became the face of a cultural revolution.

Recent statistics indicate a rising trend in suicide among the elderly. Often under-reported, depression and suicide are significant mental health concerns for this demographic.\nAn emerging mental health concern for Retirement Villages and Aged Care Facilities\nAs the baby boomer generation ages, many will enjoy reasonable physical health. However mental health issues particularly depression will become more prevalent. This is not just a concern for primary care or aged care facilities but requires serious consideration by management and staff in retirement villages. A study of suicide locations in New Zealand found that aged care facilities and retirement villages were the most common places where older people killed themselves. This has implications for family, staff and other residents.\nOlder People Suicide vs Assisted Dying\nAn understanding of the distinction between assisted dying and suicidality in older people is crucial for those working with older people. The workshop will cover the complex interrelationship of factors the between suicidality and assisted dying.\nTAYLORMADE TRAINING AND CONSULTING IS PROUD TO BE AN AGE CONCERN DIGNITY CHAMPION - TAKING A STAND AGAINST AGEISM & PROMOTING POSITIVE AGEING",

    "long_description": "After three years of closure, the newly renovated and strengthened City Gallery Wellington Te Whare Toi will host the art of Cornelia Parker. The English visual artist is best known for her innovative and contemporary sculpture and installation art. Her large-scale, immersive installations explore themes of destruction and reconstruction, transformation and metamorphosis. Objects are exploded, crushed, and suspended in a world upended and remade anew.\nCurated by independent UK-based curator Andrea Schlieker and City Gallery Wellington\u2019s Senior Curator Aaron Lister, City Gallery Wellington's exhibition will encompass Parker\u2019s long career as an artist. This includes an immersive sound and light installation, \u2018Stolen Thunder\u2019. The work gathers the sounds of approaching storms from around the globe and across time. The exhibition will also showcase her paintings, photos, films, and sculptures.\n\u201cI have always said this is the one exhibition I want to do before I die,\u201d said Charlotte Davy, Ringatohu Toi Director Art and City Gallery Wellington. \u201cI have been following Cornelia Parker\u2019s work for the last twenty years. Bringing her mischievous, dark, and literally explosive work to Wellington is incredible.\u201d \nParker\u2019s work often fills entire rooms and invites the viewer to move through and around the art. Given its physical scale, the blank canvas of the reopened gallery offers the perfect opportunity to host the exhibition. The exhibition will kick off in October 2026, carrying through to March 2027. \nCharlotte notes the exhibition\u2019s themes are also of particular relevance to Wellington. \u201cI hope that the exhibition and our return to Te Ng\u0101kau Civic Square will reflect our city and also help remake it. We are looking forward to opening with a bang.\u201d\nHero image: \u00a9 Cornelia Parker. Courtesy of the artist and Frith Street Gallery, London",

    "long_description": "Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied\nWe aim to provide an accessible and safe environment. Discounts are available for nonwaged members, early birds, volunteers and people buying multiple tickets. Please let us know how we can ensure you're included.",

    "long_description": "A fresh and influential sound dominated the charts in the 1980s \u2014 synth-pop. The Human League were one of the first bands to find success with this new sound. Now they are bringing decades of catchy hits to Wellington fans. Expect an unforgettable night with timeless classics like Don\u2019t You Want Me, Human, Love Action (I Believe in Love), The Lebanon, Mirror Man, Being Boiled, and more. \nLong before electronic music became mainstream, the band was successfully using computers and sequencers to create rhythm and melody. In the process, they redefined modern pop. Their stylish, forward-thinking sound remains relevant today as ever. In 1982, The Sydney Morning Herald described them as \u201cone of the first futurist bands.\u201d Join founding members Philip Oakey, Joanne Catherall, and Susan Ann Sulley on an electrifying journey through four decades of stylish synth-pop brilliance.",
