Beginning with a spectacular crossing of the Waiohine Gorge suspension bridge \u2014 94 metres long and 35 metres high \u2014 the walk follows fairly gentle terrain alongside the Waiohine River, through lush native bush, and without any steep climbs.\n\nAfter a 9 am bus departure from Tranzit in Masterton, we travel to the Waiohine road-end (pickup available along the way at Carterton Station, timed to meet the train from Wellington) and set off on an 8 km walk to T\u014dtara Flats Hut. This Department of Conservation hut has bunkrooms with mattresses, cooking stoves, rainwater taps, a woodstove, and a long-drop toilet. We have booked most of the hut\u2019s 26 bunks. On Day 2, wake to the sound of native birds before continuing on an 11 km walk to Holdsworth Lodge, where the bus will return us to Masterton.\n\nWhat to bring: Good shoes or boots, rain jacket, backpack, sleeping bag (in a waterproof bag), overnight clothes, toiletries, any personal medications, food, cooking pot, plate, cutlery, toilet paper, water bottle, and snacks. Optional: togs and towel, battery bank. All rubbish must be carried out.\n\nImportant:\nIf you would like extra information and your gear checked, please attend an information session with your walk leader on Sunday 2nd November 6pm, at the Carterton Courthouse.\nMust have a good level of fitness. Dogs are not permitted. There are no river crossings except by bridge, but one section requires walking along the riverbank to avoid a slip. If the river is too high, the walk will enter and return via Holdsworth. The walk leader will carry a Personal Locator Beacon, lighter, newspaper for the woodstove, and a basic first aid kit. No refunds except in exceptional circumstances or if the walk is cancelled.",

These shows will see them accompanied by Ed Zuccollo and Riki Pirihi aka Riki Gooch (TrinityRoots, Orchestra Of Spheres) to bring the album to the stage.\n\nStream the album here - https://ffm.to/traces-album\n\nThis tour marks the long-awaited debut live performance of Traces, an instrumental journey blending electronic, ambient and post-rock soundscapes to create a world unlike anything else \u2014 described by filmmaker Sam Kelly as \u201can ethereal journey through dark and moody worlds.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, audiences will be able to experience this collaboration in a live setting. With both artists renowned for their powerful, emotive performances and their ability to craft immersive sound journeys, these shows promise to be as visually striking as they are sonically transporting. Live performances from both Sheehan and Liberman are a rare treat, and this will be only the second-time ever both musicians will be performing together live.\n\nEach show will see Sheehan and Liberman joined by two collaborators on stage to help bring the worlds created in Traces to life. Ed Zuccollo will bring his trademark synth-wizardry to the stage, as he did across a number of tracks on the album. His trademark sound has seen him perform with the likes of Troy Kingi, Kita, The Black Seeds and more, in addition to his own solo work as Zuke. Riki Pirihi aka Riki Gooch is one of NZ\u2019s most celebrated musicians for his work with TrinityRoots, Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop, Cave Circles, and countless others.\n\nThe four musicians will combine to perform Traces live, with the second half of the show featuring all four musicians collaborating live on stage with tracks from each artist\u2019s individual catalogues.\n\nThese shows will also feature the stunning visuals created for the project by Dunedin-based visual artist Sam Caldwell, which are featured across the album cover and music videos. The Traces live experience will be a richly layered audio and visual feast, unlike anything either artist has performed before..\n\nTickets go on sale Thursday September 25. Audiences are encouraged to secure theirs early \u2014 with only three shows nationwide, these performances promise to be rare, unforgettable events. Presented by Loop, thanks to Manuka Phuel.\n\n",

Be serenaded by heartfelt songs of love, loss, and romance\u2014an unforgettable night of timeless classics that capture the essence of passion and longing.\n\nJoin Us for an Unforgettable Concert Experience \u2013 A Night of Music with a Heartfelt Purpose!\n\nLast year, as part of our Cultural Immersion Tour, I had the profound privilege of visiting Mamitiana Orphanage in Madagascar, alongside Stuart Simpson, Rose Ruane, and my nieces and nephews. Located on the eastern side of Antananarivo, the capital, the orphanage was founded by the incredible Madame Hary in 2012. What started as a humble project from her own home has grown into a haven for 54 children, some of whom were rescued from areas where twins are sadly believed to be cursed.\n\nDespite the challenges, the orphanage continues to thrive, relying entirely on the kindness of visitors. They grow their own rice, maintain a small chicken farm, and have a vegetable garden to sustain themselves. But their greatest need is for ongoing support and resources to continue providing for these beautiful children.\n\nBy attending our concert, you\u2019ll be helping make a direct impact on the lives of these children. All profits from this concert will go toward completing the construction of a much-needed training center and extra bedrooms at Mamitiana Orphanage in Madagascar, helping provide valuable education and support to the children in their care. In May this year, we raised over $4000 at a fundraising concert and $1700 on Givealittle.\nHelp us raise $2500 more so they can finish the building before the arrival of the rainy season.\n\n",

The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

In such a short time, she\u2019s already lit up dance floors across the country, playing at festivals like Twisted Frequency, CubaDupa, Taniwha\u2019s Den, and supporting international acts such as KC Lights.\n\nShe also holds a radio residency at Wellington\u2019s iconic Radio Active, where her show dives deep into the world of house and underground sounds.\n\nHeavily influenced by funk and disco, and driven by a love for vocals and all things groovy, Not My Sister delivers high-energy, uplifting sets full of passion and playfulness. She weaves together melodic basslines with soulful, tech, garage, and deep house elements, always keeping the crowd moving.\n\nSoundCloud: www.soundcloud.com/not-my-sister\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/notmysista\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/not.my.sister\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@not.my.sister\n\nSTOLEN TUESDAY\nStolen Tuesday started life as a house music club dancer in the UK 20 years\nago, and has spent the last 10 years DJing at Wanaka and Queenstown's best\nestablishments, bringing her unique energy to create magical dance floors.\nSince residing in New Zealand, she has previously split her time living between Great Barrier island and Wanaka, spreading the love through her weekly radio shows on Wanaka Beats and Aotea FM. Not shy of the underground scene, you will also find Stolen Tuesday getting down off grid and playing at bush doofs.\nBest known for dropping all things bassy which exude an element of fun matching her own high energy, guest appearances on Base FM (Auckland) alongside well known Auckland DJs have helped showcase her enthusiasm and talent.\nWith a style ranging from glitter box style disco and funk, to dirty after hours Tech House and all things in between, including the occasional breaks/ghetto funk set, it\u2019s no surprise that She has been a regular on the South Island festival scene where she has been happy warming up or playing after notable international artists. She has also played at Otherlanz and remotely at Great Barrier Island\u2019s new Wingman festival.\n\nStolen Tuesday now resides in Wellington and whilst fairly new to the city has already played several times for both the 'Open air' brand at Carlucci land and with Wellington renowned 'Little monsters' notably shaking things up at this year's Newtown festival.\nAlthough not one to take herself too seriously, Stolen Tuesday knows it all comes down to the music and having a good time!\n\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/user-720686581\n\nKIMBA JADE\nKimba Jade has been lighting up dancefloors for over 20 years with her signature blend of deep, funky, and globally inspired grooves. A master of musical journeying, she weaves bass-driven beats with tribal, melodic, and soulful sounds that move both body and spirit.\n\nWith a deep passion for Ecstatic Dance and the power of music to connect and uplift, Kimba brings that same vibrant energy into clubs and bars. Her sets fuse Tech House, Indie Dance, and Techno, blending driving rhythms with emotive melodies to create an atmosphere that\u2019s both immersive and electric.\n\nAfter years in Sydney and Auckland\u2019s underground scenes, Kimba now calls Wellington home\u2014bringing her unique mix of rhythm, soul, and bass to local dance floors.\n\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/kimba\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/kimbadj/\nInstangram: @djkimbajade\n\nK-OTIK\nBased in Wellington, New Zealand, K-otiK is a multi-genre DJ. His sound spans house, tech house, bass house, and techno \u2014 laced with heavy vocals and thumping basslines. With a cheeky stage presence and high energy behind the decks, K-otiK takes crowds on journeys that balance careful curation with unexpected twists. A regular on RadioActive FM and part of Wellington\u2019s Open Air collective, he\u2019s built a reputation for spreading joy through music. For K-otiK, music does not discriminate \u2014 it\u2019s the universal language that brings people together.\n\nInstangram: @dj_kotik_nz\n\n\n",

Your waxes will be sent away for casting in the metal of your choice.\n\nThen there will be a week's break before the third session, to allow time for everyone's waxes to be cast. The third session covers how to trim, clean and finish your casts, turning them into original jewellery ready to wear!\n\nMore advanced students can use these sessions to complete projects in a class setting.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are all your different types of waxes, sandpaper and courier costs.\n\nNot included are the casting and metal costs which vary from student to student depending on what sized ring they want to make and the type of metal you choose. Small castings can cost around $6.65 - $12 and might cost between $7 to $30 in metals depending on if you use red bronze, white bronze or silver.\n\nThis class is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.",

    "long_description": "A theatrical double-shot from an iconic playwright and one of our greatest actors.\n\nBruce Mason is perhaps the most significant playwright in Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s theatrical history. Writing with courage and insight, he was a lover of language and a champion of the underdog.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1978, Bruce toured the country, telling uniquely Kiwi stories about emerging identity, cultural cringe and social difference. From church halls to country shearing sheds to the Edinburgh Festival, Bruce would play anywhere, in any circumstance, to any audience.\n\nTo celebrate his extraordinary legacy, Brilliant Adventures and Circa Theatre are collaborating to make two of his greatest solo works resound for a new age.\n\nTwo plays: timeless, universal, distinct. Following their critically acclaimed, sold out run of THINGS I KNOW TO BE TRUE, actor Stephen Lovatt and director Shane Bosher return to Circa for a not-to-be missed theatrical encounter with a master craftsman.\n\nTHE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER\n\u201cI invite you to join me, in a voyage into the past, to that territory of the heart we call childhood.\u201d\n\nBruce Mason\u2019s quintessential Kiwi classic chronicles the friendship between a 12-year-old boy and Firpo, a social outcast who dreams of winning an Olympic medal.\n\nThrough the boy\u2019s eyes we see the wonder of life on a perfect beach, in a perfect 1930s New Zealand, during a perfect summer. It\u2019s a world of magic and transformation, where anything can happen and miracles seem possible.\n\nWhen the boy sets out to help Firpo make his athletic dream a reality, ignoring his father\u2019s rebukes and community ridicule, a battle rages between the eternal optimism of childhood and the harsh pragmatism of adulthood.\n\nGliding effortlessly between flights of poetic fancy and blunt everyday speech, THE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER is New Zealand storytelling at its very best.\n\nNOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES\nAn adolescent boy tries to find his place in an adult-dominated world. A young man retraces an intensely felt boyhood experience of bullying. A playwright in his last days reconciles the value of an artistic life and challenges the idea of New Zealand identity.\n\nComic disasters and confronting your own hubris. NOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES is a richly autobiographical search for self-expression. Profound and true, it is a set of variations about over-reaching, cheekily confronting our very own Tall Poppy Syndrome.\n\nCelebrating Bruce Mason\nDirected by Shane Bosher\nPerformed by Stephen Lovatt\n\nThursday 20 November to Saturday 13 December\nPreview Night: Wed 19 Nov \u2013 The End of the Golden Weather\nPreview Night: Fri 21 Nov \u2013 Not Christmas, But Guy Fawkes\nSunday Special: Sunday 23 November \u2013 The End of the Golden Weather\nQ&A: Tuesday 25 November\nChoose Your Price Night: Wed 26 November \u2013 Not Christmas, But Guy Fawkes\nCirca Two\nTues \u2013 Fri 7.30pm, Sat 4.30pm & 7.30pm, Sun 4.30pm\n$30 \u2013 $60 Early Bird Tickets Available\n\nProductions play on alternate nights with an opportunity to see both productions in conversation with each other on Saturdays",

    "long_description": "A theatrical double-shot from an iconic playwright and one of our greatest actors.\n\nBruce Mason is perhaps the most significant playwright in Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s theatrical history. Writing with courage and insight, he was a lover of language and a champion of the underdog.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1978, Bruce toured the country, telling uniquely Kiwi stories about emerging identity, cultural cringe and social difference. From church halls to country shearing sheds to the Edinburgh Festival, Bruce would play anywhere, in any circumstance, to any audience.\n\nTo celebrate his extraordinary legacy, Brilliant Adventures and Circa Theatre are collaborating to make two of his greatest solo works resound for a new age.\n\nTwo plays: timeless, universal, distinct. Following their critically acclaimed, sold out run of THINGS I KNOW TO BE TRUE, actor Stephen Lovatt and director Shane Bosher return to Circa for a not-to-be missed theatrical encounter with a master craftsman.\n\n\nTHE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER\n\u201cI invite you to join me, in a voyage into the past, to that territory of the heart we call childhood.\u201d\n\nBruce Mason\u2019s quintessential Kiwi classic chronicles the friendship between a 12-year-old boy and Firpo, a social outcast who dreams of winning an Olympic medal.\n\nThrough the boy\u2019s eyes we see the wonder of life on a perfect beach, in a perfect 1930s New Zealand, during a perfect summer. It\u2019s a world of magic and transformation, where anything can happen and miracles seem possible.\n\nWhen the boy sets out to help Firpo make his athletic dream a reality, ignoring his father\u2019s rebukes and community ridicule, a battle rages between the eternal optimism of childhood and the harsh pragmatism of adulthood.\n\nGliding effortlessly between flights of poetic fancy and blunt everyday speech, THE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER is New Zealand storytelling at its very best.\n\n\nNOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES\nAn adolescent boy tries to find his place in an adult-dominated world. A young man retraces an intensely felt boyhood experience of bullying. A playwright in his last days reconciles the value of an artistic life and challenges the idea of New Zealand identity.\n\nComic disasters and confronting your own hubris. NOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES is a richly autobiographical search for self-expression. Profound and true, it is a set of variations about over-reaching, cheekily confronting our very own Tall Poppy Syndrome.\n\nCelebrating Bruce Mason\nDirected by Shane Bosher\nPerformed by Stephen Lovatt\n\nPlease note The End of the Golden Weather and Not Christmas, but Guy Fawkes tickets need to be purchases separately, see the Circa Theatre website for full dates and ticket details.",

These shows will see them accompanied by Ed Zuccollo and Riki Pirihi aka Riki Gooch (TrinityRoots, Orchestra Of Spheres) to bring the album to the stage.\n\nThis tour marks the long-awaited debut live performance of Traces, an instrumental journey blending electronic, ambient and post-rock soundscapes to create a world unlike anything else \u2014 described by filmmaker Sam Kelly as \u201can ethereal journey through dark and moody worlds.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, audiences will be able to experience this collaboration in a live setting. With both artists renowned for their powerful, emotive performances and their ability to craft immersive sound journeys, these shows promise to be as visually striking as they are sonically transporting. Live performances from both Sheehan and Liberman are a rare treat, and this will be only the second-time ever both musicians will be performing together live.\n\nEach show will see Sheehan and Liberman joined by two collaborators on stage to help bring the worlds created in Traces to life. Ed Zuccollo will bring his trademark synth-wizardry to the stage, as he did across a number of tracks on the album. His trademark sound has seen him perform with the likes of Troy Kingi, Kita, The Black Seeds and more, in addition to his own solo work as Zuke. Riki Pirihi aka Riki Gooch is one of NZ\u2019s most celebrated musicians for his work with TrinityRoots, Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop, Cave Circles, and countless others.\n\nThe four musicians will combine to perform Traces live, with the second half of the show featuring all four musicians collaborating live on stage with tracks from each artist\u2019s individual catalogues.\n\nThese shows will also feature the stunning visuals created for the project by Dunedin-based visual artist Sam Caldwell, which are featured across the album cover and music videos. The Traces live experience will be a richly layered audio and visual feast, unlike anything either artist has performed before..\n\nTickets go on sale Thursday September 25. Audiences are encouraged to secure theirs early \u2014 with only three shows nationwide, these performances promise to be rare, unforgettable events. Presented by Loop, thanks to Manuka Phuel.",

She has also played at Otherlanz and remotely at Great Barrier Island\u2019s new Wingman festival.\nStolen Tuesday now resides in Wellington and whilst fairly new to the city has already played several times for both the 'Open air' brand at Carlucci land and with Wellington renowned 'Little monsters' notably shaking things up at this year's Newtown festival.\nAlthough not one to take herself too seriously, Stolen Tuesday knows it all comes down to the music and having a good time!\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/user-720686581\nKIMBA JADE\nKimba Jade has been lighting up dancefloors for over 20 years with her signature blend of deep, funky, and globally inspired grooves.

The puzzle swap operates on an honesty-based system. NZJPA will not be inspecting puzzles and cannot guarantee their completeness or condition. We are providing a space for puzzle enthusiasts to swap puzzles.\n\nPlease refrain from bringing puzzles with missing pieces or significant damage (e.g., water damage, severe fraying). It's important to ensure everyone has a positive experience.\n\nSwap puzzles 'like-for-like'. For example, exchange a 1000-piece puzzle for another 1000-piece puzzle, or a 500-piece puzzle for another 500-piece puzzle.\n\nFor puzzles with an irregular number of pieces, choose the nearest size available, considering both size and quality. The attendant can help you decide if needed.\n\nEnjoy swapping and updating your puzzle collection!\n\n",

Gemma Hoskins is Am\u00e9lie\u2019s mother, and William Duignan plays the pop icon Elton John. A cast of thirteen takes on many roles, from greengrocers to goldfish. Produced by WITCH Music Theatre, the show captures the whimsy of the film that made Am\u00e9lie a global favourite. It features a Grammy-nominated score by Daniel Mess\u00e9 and Nathan Tyson, as well as a witty book by Craig Lucas. Directors Maya Handa Naff and Nick Lerew, with music director Hayden Taylor, bring Am\u00e9lie\u2019s quirky world to life. The Guardian has described the musical as \u201ca magical and emotional triumph\u201d.",

Its return 34 years later at the 2026 festival is highly anticipated. It has become a landmark piece of New Zealand theatre \u2014 exploring the tension between past and future. Set in the summer of 1965, the play follows Hone, who brings his family from New Zealand\u2019s East Cape to the South Island in search of a better life. As they gather for a beachside birthday h\u0101ng\u012b with their P\u0101keh\u0101 guests, buried secrets and cultural tensions rise to the surface. Far from their  t\u012bpuna , the family must navigate questions of identity, belonging, and survival. \nWaiora Te \u016akaip\u014d was conceived, written and directed by Hone Kouka (Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101ti Raukawa, Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu). The multi-award-winning writer/director has penned 13 plays. Many have been staged in Aotearoa and further afield in Canada, South Africa, New Caledonia, and the UK. Waiora Te \u016akaip\u014d is presented in partnership with the Aotearoa New Zealand Festival of the Arts, Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, Auckland Theatre Company and Tawata Productions.",

Based on a movie with the same name, the show is a coming-of-age story dealing with love, heartache, defying expectations, and being true to yourself. It originally premiered in Los Angeles in 2013. Since then, the musical has had record-breaking seasons across the globe. It now makes its professional New Zealand debut in 2026, and Wellington is in line to join the school assembly. Described as a high-octane, black comedy rock musical, Heathers is packed with a mix of ballads and showstoppers. The catchy tunes are written by Kevin Murphy (Desperate Housewives) and Laurence O\u2019Keefe (Legally Blonde: The Musical). \nThe 1989 film starred Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. It quickly achieved cult status among audiences. Both the movie and musical follow high school student Veronica Sawyer. Veronica is just another nobody until she\u2019s unexpectedly taken under the wings of the beautiful and cruel Heathers. When mysterious teen rebel J.D. arrives, Veronica learns that it might kill to be a nobody, but it's murder being a somebody. \nThis special production will feature a stellar Australasian cast. So grab your scrunchies, break out the Corn Nuts and wait for the bell to ring.",

As well as exploring the Bazaar \u2013 Innermost Gardens, transformed into a bustling market with secrets around every corner \u2013 they\u2019ll be treated to a Farragonian feast.\n\nFarrago Bazaar is a one-day experience with only two performances, on Saturday 22nd November: a matinee at 2pm and an evening show at 7pm.\n\nTickets are available now at https://www.redscare.co.nz/farrago-bazaar\n\n",

    "long_description": "Nui Hui 7\nNUI HUI 7 \u2013 LIVE AT 14 WAIU STREET\nWainuiomata, Lower Hutt\nSaturday 22 November 2025 | 4PM \u2013 LATE\n\nNui Hui is back \u2013 louder, prouder, and more unfiltered than ever. This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\nAlso check out other Music events in Lower Hutt, Entertainment events in Lower Hutt, Arts events in Lower Hutt.",

    "long_description": "What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

    "long_description": "Gain the confidence and skills to maintain your bicycle in good working order, and to diagnose and fix some mechanical problems. Get familiar with bike terms and tools and learn through practical experience.\n\nHave you recently started riding a bike and want to make sure you can take care of it properly? Or have you been riding for ages, but have always been scared to fix anything yourself?\n\nAre you unsure of how to pump your tyres, or how much oil your chain needs? Find yourself fumbling for words when trying to describe that clunking sound to the guy in the bike shop?\n\nThis one day course lays bare the nuts and bolts of bicycle mechanics for absolute beginners, as well as those with a little experience. Through practical experience working with your own bicycle, you will find out what needs to be done to keep it running smoothly. We\u2019ll cover what to look out for when things start to wear out, and how to check for problems, so you can be confident your bicycle is safe to ride. You will also learn how to fix some of the most common mechanical problems, and learn about the correct terminology and tools to use.\n\nThose who feel intimidated in bike shops are especially welcome in this course. No question is a stupid question!\n\nBringing a bike to work on is essential, preferably one that you are riding regularly, because the best way to learn is by building familiarity with your own ride. E-bikes are welcome, although the extra weight can mean they are more challenging to work on. Regardless of whether your bike is in pristine condition, or desperately in need of TLC, it is welcome on the course \u2013 bikes showing a bit more wear can be useful for the learning of the whole group.\n\nBring your pushbike along on the day, If you have the following, please bring them as well: A multi-tool and pump; chain oil and rag; lightweight close-fitting gardening or rubber gloves.\n\n(Please note this course is not exhaustive and is not a professional training course).\n\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:\n- Name most parts of a bicycle correctly\n- Perform a quick safety check on any bicycle\n- Fix a flat tyre\n- Adjust your bike to fit your body\n- Oil and clean your chain\n- Identify and fix some common brake problems\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".",

    "long_description": "This class is for level 2+ and advanced students. It is not open to beginners. This more advanced class is ideal for those who are already competent at soldering simple joins, annealing, and basic tool use on their own.\n\nThe course starts on Saturday 22 November and runs for 4 weeks until Saturday 13 December, 10am-1pm.\n\nStudents must have completed two 4-week blocks or a 6-week block at a minimum. If you are unsure of your level because you may have done a few different shorter classes, please contact us and we can advise you.\n\nA more advanced set of students means that your tutor can support you and the group to take on more exciting and complex challenges. They will work with the group to find appropriate projects for you and for the class as a whole. Each 4-week block may focus on a particular skill topic, rather than doing loads of different topics with each student over the block.\n\nLevel 2 students learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking as a way to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project so they have something to hone their skills that they are familiar with, as well as taking on a new skill. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet, or a more complex bezel setting.\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple projects they can work on self-directed in class.\n\nThis class fee does NOT include materials for any student.\n\nAll metals and stones, as well as quality findings and chains, are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it thriftily in future projects.\n\nAll metals and stones as well as quality findings and chains are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it thriftily in future projects!\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time please email us to arrange this ;)",

    "long_description": "Wellington Vocal Blokes return to Greytown\n\u2013 Older, Bolder, and Still Singing\nGreytown, you asked for an encore \u2014 and we couldn\u2019t resist.\nWellington\u2019s Vocal Blokes are crossing the Remutakas once again for a full day of music, laughter, and good company on Saturday, 22 November.\nOur concert last year was such a hit that we\u2019ve decided to do it all again \u2014 only bigger and better. This time we\u2019re adding two singing workshops led by our young and inspiring music director Paddy Shanahan, before rounding the day off with the 4:30 pm concert Over the Hill and Still Singing at the St Andrews Union Church Hall.\nWorkshop 1: Finding Your Voice (11:30 \u2013 1:00 pm)\nThink you \u201ccan\u2019t sing\u201d? Paddy Shanahan would disagree.\nIn this light-hearted session, he\u2019ll show how singing is really just \u201ctalking on pitch.\u201d Starting with Reviewing the Situation from Oliver!, you\u2019ll discover how expression and rhythm turn everyday speech into music. No solos, no pressure \u2014 just an easy, encouraging space to let your voice come alive.\nWorkshop 2: Singing Together (2:00 \u2013 3:30 pm)\nOnce you\u2019ve warmed up, it\u2019s time to build harmony.\nDrawing inspiration from Jacob Collier\u2019s version of Coldplay\u2019s Fix You, Paddy will guide the group in shaping simple \u201coohs\u201d into rich, layered sound. It\u2019s less about perfection and more about listening, blending, and feeling the joy of shared music.\nIf you take part in this second workshop, you\u2019ll also be invited to join the Vocal Blokes on stage for one song at the afternoon concert \u2014 a true \u201ccommunity choir\u201d moment.\nWorkshops cost just $20 each or $35 for both, and if you enrol for both you get free entry to the concert.\nThe Concert \u2013 Over the Hill and Still Singing\nAt 4:30 pm, the St Andrews Hall doors open for a concert that promises to be every bit as joyful as last year\u2019s \u2014 maybe even more. Over the Hill and Still Singing is a playful nod to our journey from Wellington to Greytown and to the fact that most of us are, well, not exactly in our twenties anymore.\nBut that\u2019s the beauty of it \u2014 we sing for the sheer love of it. Expect songs about travel, friendship, and meeting new people, all delivered with our trademark mix of heart and humour.\nWe love performing for Greytown audiences because you listen, laugh, and sing along in all the right places. There\u2019s something special about this town \u2014 the warmth, the curiosity, the way the hall fills with energy before the first note.\nCome Join the Chorus\nSo whether you\u2019re a shower-soloist, a closet crooner, or simply someone who enjoys good company and great music, come spend the day with us.\nBring your voice, bring a friend, and rediscover how good it feels to sing together.\nWorkshops at 11:30 am and 2:00 pm.\nConcert at 4:30 pm \u2014 St Andrews Union Church Hall.\nBecause being Over the Hill just means you\u2019ve found a better view.",

Their blend of country, Americana, bluegrass, and folk influences with a distinctly New Zealand flavour, promises audiences an evocative performance defined by their poetic lyricism, powerful harmonies and thought provoking stories. The band includes Andrea Reid (Vocals and rhythm guitar), Nick Burfield (Vocals and lead guitar), Cara Brasted (Fiddle and vocals), Marz Connelly (Double bass and vocals), and Mikey Muggeridge (Mandolin and vocals).On the back of the success of their first Album, Butter Wouldn\u2019t Melt got to work in the studio and in 2025 released Where the roots grow deep, an ode to all the music that brought them together in the first place. This album turned out to be the first chapter in a two-part album journey and is set to be followed by Beneath the stars above in 2026. Together, these albums form a story in contrast\u2014two sides of the same mountain, two worlds intertwined: one bathed in light, the other steeped in shadow. Both records showcase Butter Wouldn\u2019t Melt\u2019s signature local storytelling and rich harmonies, weaving contemporary folk, country, bluegrass, and Americana into a sound that is as timeless as it is deeply personal. Expect these two worlds to collide brilliantly in this performance.\n\nCome along and enjoy their great gig in our special space, up close and personal.\nNot for profit, supporting our dedicated musicians.

    "long_description": "After close to a decade away from live stages, the mighty High Dependency Unit return this November announcing their first shows since 2016 including a key festival performance at The Others Way, and an all ages show in Port Chalmers to kick off the tour.\n\nSince their formation in 1993, HDU have carved out a singular space in Aotearoa\u2019s music landscape, fusing and funneling shoegaze and psychedelic noise into hypnotic, sonic power. Their live shows are the stuff of legend, their studio output of essential albums and EPs through the 90s and 2000s have become touchstones for generations of musicians both here and abroad.\n\nThe return of Tristan Dingemans, Neil Phillips, and Constantine Karlis to the stage and a rare chance to witness HDU in full flight is nothing short of a seismic event. These November dates will see the band revisit their formidable back catalogue and remind audiences why they\u2019ve long been considered one of New Zealand\u2019s most powerful live acts.\n\nAdding to the magic of this tour, HDU\u2019s Wellington Meow Nui show will feature very special guests W.I.T.C.H. on the bill. The legendary 1970s Zamrock pioneers whose psychedelic rock, funk, and African rhythms have made them cult icons around the world, W.I.T.C.H. (We Intend To Cause Havoc) are in the midst of a global renaissance, bringing their irresistible live energy to new generations making this one-off pairing with HDU an utterly unmissable night.",

His material usually draws from life experiences, and previous stand-up has covered observations about fatherhood, cycling around the world, playing semi-professional football, and his time working as a nightclub doorman. His Michael Fowler Centre show will undoubtedly showcase his famous natural charm and humility while delivering hilarious observations. \n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it will be 25 years since I first performed at the Frog and Bucket in Manchester. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster!\u201d says John. On top of stand-up comedy, he has found fame as a presenter. Among his many television appearances is \u2018John Bishop: In Conversation With\u2026\u2019 This series saw him chatting with some of the biggest names in entertainment, music and sport. He has also fronted multiple documentary-style shows.",

Choose between doing your own thing, or jumping on a serene cruise of the Whanganui River onboard the coal fired paddle steamer \"PS Waimarie\".\n\nLeaving Kapiti as most others are still sound asleep, we quickly escape the coast and delve into the rurality of the Horowhenua. After a stop in Palmerston North we head up the trunk through the townships of Feilding and Marton before turning onto the Marton - New Plymouth railway line for the last stretch into Whanganui.

An excellent first project for beginners in this class is to create a simple textured ring band - but once you have the basics down, it is fun to create earrings, pendants or other simple items. Learning to cut, heat, form and texture metal - to solder using a jeweller's torch and silver solder, and finally to polish your work up to a beautiful finish: these classes are super satisfying.\n\nThese blocks are also a nice way for existing students or more advanced makers to work on more challenging projects and join friendly classes in our well-equipped studio!\n\nAll materials you need can be purchased in class - beginners should expect to use around $30 - $40 of metals in this block.\n\nThis block is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. NOTE: Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.\n\nOur booking system asks for full payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time please email us to arrange this ;)",

    "long_description": "We invite you to spend a day at Doris & Bob's, experiencing how permaculture can help you design more than just your garden! Applicable in all situations of life, no need to own your own place.\nDoris will share her journey of integrating the permaculture design approach into her life's questions, her diverse home and community projects in Paekakariki (eg. PaeCycle, a food scrap collection set up and Pataka Kai, the public cupboard to give and take food abundance), and as Trustee of Toru Education: Motivated by an sense of urgency and responsibility to take care of our finite resources and to care for our environment with all its diverse wildlife and each other. Through storytelling and practical examples, we'll explore how these principles can help shape our lives and communities for the better, and how we all can contribute as individuals. Every choice we make matters.\nWe also will take a stroll through Doris's garden and engage in some hands-on activities to experience some of the principles in action. Of course, we will spend some time at the various compost heaps (Compost is Doris' middle name!). Regenerating soil with home made compost! Making compost involving food scraps (closely predator managed) or from garden waste (free standing heaps). \nLunch will be provided\u2014feel free to bring a small contribution to go with the homemade bread if you'd like (but not expected).\nAfter lunch, we will explore the design process of creating a base map for your specific setting, whether it be a your home garden, personal question such as 'What's next?' or a community project.\nNo prior experience in permaculture is needed. We hope you will leave with new ideas and connections, practical inspiration for your own compost making and an enhanced understanding of how many ways you can apply the permaculture design process and create community, one compost heap at the time!\nThere will also be a crop swap table where we practice the permaculture approach of reciprocity of 'give and take'; you might enjoy bringing seeds, seedlings, produce from your garden, and walk away with something unexpected (again, don't feel obliged to contribute).\nSpaces are limited to 15 spaces to fit into our living room, so make sure you reserve your spot. We are at 59 Wellington Road, up the driveway on your right. Don't follow google directions as that would take you down to the beach. Just come on down Wellington Road, and we are up on your left. Please park below by the lay-by and walk up. We have a friendly little Cavalier type dog called 'Honey' as part of our family. ",

    "long_description": "A theatrical double-shot from an iconic playwright and one of our greatest actors.\n\nBruce Mason is perhaps the most significant playwright in Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s theatrical history. Writing with courage and insight, he was a lover of language and a champion of the underdog.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1978, Bruce toured the country, telling uniquely Kiwi stories about emerging identity, cultural cringe and social difference. From church halls to country shearing sheds to the Edinburgh Festival, Bruce would play anywhere, in any circumstance, to any audience.\n\nTo celebrate his extraordinary legacy, Brilliant Adventures and Circa Theatre are collaborating to make two of his greatest solo works resound for a new age.\n\nTwo plays: timeless, universal, distinct. Following their critically acclaimed, sold out run of THINGS I KNOW TO BE TRUE, actor Stephen Lovatt and director Shane Bosher return to Circa for a not-to-be missed theatrical encounter with a master craftsman.\n\n\nTHE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER\n\u201cI invite you to join me, in a voyage into the past, to that territory of the heart we call childhood.\u201d\n\nBruce Mason\u2019s quintessential Kiwi classic chronicles the friendship between a 12-year-old boy and Firpo, a social outcast who dreams of winning an Olympic medal.\n\nThrough the boy\u2019s eyes we see the wonder of life on a perfect beach, in a perfect 1930s New Zealand, during a perfect summer. It\u2019s a world of magic and transformation, where anything can happen and miracles seem possible.\n\nWhen the boy sets out to help Firpo make his athletic dream a reality, ignoring his father\u2019s rebukes and community ridicule, a battle rages between the eternal optimism of childhood and the harsh pragmatism of adulthood.\n\nGliding effortlessly between flights of poetic fancy and blunt everyday speech, THE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER is New Zealand storytelling at its very best.\n\n\nNOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES\nAn adolescent boy tries to find his place in an adult-dominated world. A young man retraces an intensely felt boyhood experience of bullying. A playwright in his last days reconciles the value of an artistic life and challenges the idea of New Zealand identity.\n\nComic disasters and confronting your own hubris. NOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES is a richly autobiographical search for self-expression. Profound and true, it is a set of variations about over-reaching, cheekily confronting our very own Tall Poppy Syndrome.\n\nCelebrating Bruce Mason\nDirected by Shane Bosher\nPerformed by Stephen Lovatt\n\nPlease note The End of the Golden Weather and Not Christmas, but Guy Fawkes tickets need to be purchases separately, see the Circa Theatre website for full dates and ticket details.",

Eventually realising you could get paid for it, casual work for bars and clubs kept the gas tank full and led to his first poster distribution company The Stick Up!\nAfter a much needed hiatus, Steve returned to the music industry a few years ago, via record and poster retail. Steve now runs Wellington poster company Pasted!, and remains an active musician and promoter\nAfter decades of sporadic trading, Steve still has an extensive poster collection acquired from a vast array of sources.

A range of ages for the cast of approximately 20.\n\nThose interested in being onstage, backstage, or forming the troupe of musicians are encouraged to come along to our Information Evening to find out all about this passionate and fun celebration of Shakespeare and the art of theatre.\n\nSee the cast list on our website - www.boathousetheatre.co.nz\n\nThe auditions will be Monday 8th and Tuesday 9th December, 7pm Boathouse Theatre.\n\n\nWhat is Shakespeare in Love?\n\nA romantic piece of historical fiction, the story centers around a young Will Shakespeare as he struggles to find his inspiration. Enter the feisty, aristocratic Viola de Lesseps, who longs to be an actor. The relationship they forge serves as inspiration for\nWill\u2019s greatest play \u2013 Romeo and Juliet.\nThis stage adaptation of the 1998 film brings Shakespeare\u2019s dialogue to the forefront and highlights its theatrical origins. Much of the dialogue is taken from Shakespeare\u2019s cannon (with Romeo and Juliet featured heavily throughout) and many of the plot devices employ tactics commonly found in plays of the Elizabethan age: cross-dressing disguises, mistaken identities, suspicions of adultery, sword fighting, a comedic nurse, and even\nvisions of ghosts are all present, as is the enduring \u201cplay-within-a-play\u201d convention that Shakespeare fondly adopted for many of his works. Overall, Shakespeare in Love delivers a delightfully crowd-pleasing, deeply romantic, and highly adventurous tale of love and drama in Renaissance-era England.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Pacific style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and effective insights. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from different communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from You Spot It, You Got It?\nIn You Spot It, You Got It, you will deepen self-awareness by being encouraged to recognise some of your own conditioning and impacts of this in your daily life/practices. When we are not conscious of the things that might not sit right within us then we unknowingly or knowingly project them onto others. What we reject, we project. By examining patterns and recognising our conditioning, then we can truly understand how we can live in more conscious ways. This Talanoa Tai learning experience offers space for talanoa, tools and exercises to facilitate introspection and personal growth by turning the mirror inwards.\nThis is a 3.5 hour in-person learning experience. The day will start with a mihi whakatau to welcome you into the space.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\nFacilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives. Fa\u2019aeafale\u2019upolu (Polu) Samuelu is the facilitator of this Talanoa Tai Learning experience.",

He has had a variety of careers however employment has mostly been a means to an end, and his real career continues to revolve around the mountains.\nHe has been on expeditions to the Northern Patagonian Icecap, Himalayas, Karakoram Range, Yunnan and Tibet and worked in the Dry Valleys for Antarctica New Zealand. However, in the background, there were always transalpine tramping and climbing trips throughout the Southern Alps, where he explored interesting corners including the Ngapunatoru Plateau, Olivine Ranges, Volta, Hooker Wilderness, Cook area, Godley, Gardens, the Bracken Snowfield, and other remote places.\nGeoff is perhaps best known for the books he has written, including his latest, \u2018The Great Unknown\u2019, a photo and text essay of Southern Alps wilderness trips, designed to encourage and inspire more journeys, and for his behind-the-scenes roles in successful television series. In recent years, Geoff has been actively involved in the care of our back country assets and is a founding member of the Backcountry Trust Board.\nEnquiries:\nDave Bamford, dave@davebamford.co.nz Tel 027 457 0313\nAndy Carruthers, chair@wellingtonalpineclub.org.nz Tel 021 244 6051\n\nMature Mountaineer meetings are a NZ Alpine Club initiative providing an opportunity for older members of the NZAC & affiliated clubs to get together, share and hear stories (usually from an invited speaker), and have afternoon tea. The intention is to provide a social gathering for those less likely to go out to evening events. The concept has been successful in Christchurch (since 2006), Auckland and Wellington. The functions are open to all interested outdoor enthusiasts and are made possible thanks to support from T\u016bpiki Trust. ",

No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz\n\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing. It is not intended as therapy nor does it replace counselling, therapy, or any other medical or clinical professional help. Participants are guided to draw out where they are at, whilst drawing out their own inner resources for support and guidance.\nParticipants understand it is their own responsibility to manage their mental and physical health during sessions, to opt in and out of activities as they see fit, and make the facilitator aware if further support is required.",

    "long_description": "Welcome to the grand finale of Shostakovich: Unpacked. A four-part concert series presented by New Zealand String Quartet and friends to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Shostakovich\u2019s death.\n \nSo far, across three night-time gatherings, the NZSQ has taken to the stage with Orchestra Wellington, Antipodes Quartet and Ghost Trio to explore the raw emotional power of one of the 20th century\u2019s most troubled, yet defiant, musical voices. Now, it\u2019s time for the series to come to its climactic conclusion at the fourth programme, featuring renowned pianist Jian Liu.\nEach concert features a specially curated selection of the chamber music of Shostakovich, paired with the unique voices of Aotearoa composers. From duets, to quartets, to a full chamber orchestra, we're getting up close to the celebrated chamber music and lasting legacy of Dimitri Shostakovich, 50 years after his death. This final programme features an exciting new composition by student composer, Estella Wallace. Estella is the recipient of the Finlayson Prize, developed by the New Zealand String Quartet Trust in partnership with New Zealand School of Music - Te K\u014dk\u012b and SOUNZ Centre for New Zealand Music and generously sponsored by Hon. Christopher Finlayson. The prize invited students to compose a new piece for string quartet inspired by and responding to the life and works of Dmitri Shostakovich. Estella's new piece, 'Of Sorrows', will be performed by the NZSQ musicians alongside two of Shostakovich's most powerful works: his Piano Quintet, and the final piece he ever wrote, his Viola and Piano Sonata.\n \nWe invite you to join us in concluding the journey of \u201cShostakovich: UNPACKED\u201d. Together we will explore and question what this powerful music meant in the time Shostakovich wrote it, and how vitally important the composer\u2019s artistic voice still is today.\nConcert Four: Tuesday 25 November, 6:30pm, NZSQ x Jian Liu\nArtists onstage: NZSQ / Jian Liu\nShostakovich: Piano Quintet, Viola and Piano Sonata\nUnpacked: Of Sorrows - a brand-new composition by emerging composer, Estella Wallace. Generously supported by Hon. Christopher Finlayson.\nSpotlight: The artistic culmination of \u201cShostakovich: UNPACKED\u201d, and the heart of the entire series. Following a performance of Shostakovich\u2019s celebrated Piano Quintet, bear witness to one of the most special artistic collaborations of 2025. Award-winning pianist Jian Liu joins beloved NZSQ founding member, Gillian Ansell MNZN, in the very last work written by Dmitri Shostakovich. Ending in hushed silence, and in almost total darkness, this concert will not only leave listeners deeply moved by what Shostakovich experienced throughout his own life but also inspire reflection of what we as human beings still experience throughout our world today.\nTickets: $15 - $55\nIn order:\nWednesday 9 July, 6:30pm & 8:30pm, NZSQ + Orchestra Wellington\nWednesday 6 August, 6:30pm, NZSQ + Antipodes Quartet\nSpecial Addition in Auckland: Wednesday 24 September, 7pm, NZSQ + Ghost Trio\nWednesday 1 October, 6:30pm, NZSQ + Ghost Trio\nSpecial Addition in Nelson: Tuesday 28 October, 7pm, NZSQ + Jian Liu\nTuesday 25 November, 6:30pm, NZSQ + Jian Liu",

The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\nThroughout history, especially at times of crisis, great spiritual teachers have emerged to show humanity the next step forward.\n\nAccording to British artist, author and esotericist Benjamin Creme, a group of such spiritual teachers is now living in the modern world ~ Maitreya, the World Teacher and The Masters of Wisdom ~ to help and inspire humanity in its task of global transformation ~ to create a civilisation based on sharing, justice and peace; for humanity to act - to share and save our world.\n\nFrom ancient times, a body of spiritual teachings known as the Ageless Wisdom has been handed down from generation to generation. A systematic and comprehensive account of the evolution of consciousness in humanity and nature, it describes how the universe came to exist, how it operates, and humanity\u2019s place within it.\n\nAs humanity matures, further aspects of this previously hidden knowledge are released in a wider, more open manner. Throughout the last 100 years, the Ageless Wisdom Teachings have been communicated through individuals such as Helena Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society, and later by Alice A. Bailey and Helena Roerich, followed by Benjamin Creme.\n\nAlong the lines of these teachings, humanity is once again at a critical point in its further development, now with a growing awareness of the necessity for unity, justice and peace.\n\nAccording to these teachings, Maitreya \u2013 known as the Teacher for this coming Age of Aquarius \u2013 will emphasise the utter necessity for peace, and that the complete renunciation of war can only be achieved by trust. Sharing alone, Maitreya will affirm, can engender that trust.\n\n~ followed by a short Transmission Meditation session ~\nShare International New Zealand.

After an early career touring the UK and France \u2013 including sharing stages with Ed Sheeran \u2013 Ali settled in Aotearoa New Zealand, where salty sea winds and bush covered landscapes continue to shape his sound.\n-----------------\nTom Cunliffe returns with 'Spit Out Your Gum' \u2013 his fourth album and most intimate release to date. Vivid, offbeat, and full of heart, the record captures Cunliffe at his most direct, delivering a collection of songs that glow with warmth and humanity.\nAcross its tracks, Cunliffe takes listeners on a journey from the streets of London to the bright lights of Karangahape Road, and out into the cold green waves of the Irish Sea. Each song feels alive \u2013 steeped in imagery, character, and a quiet intensity that rewards deep listening.\nRecorded live-to-tape at Roundhead Studios, 'Spit Out Your Gum' carries the unmistakable warmth of that hallowed room and the people within it. With Paddy Hill engineering, Cunliffe was joined by Dave Khan (violin, piano) and Cass Basil (bass, clarinet).\nTogether, they captured performances that unfold in real time \u2013 no edits, no digital polish, just songs recorded in single takes, preserving the intimacy, imperfection, and energy of the moment.\n\n",

Vicky is cast in Lermatov\u2019s new production, \u201cThe Ballet of the Red Shoes\u201d, based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale of the same name. In the prevailing gender norms of the 1940s, Vicky must choose between her career and her marriage \u2013 but will the mysterious power of the red shoes mean they have the final say?\nThe Red Shoes revels in its glorious Technicolor aesthetic, and for Scorsese offers the perfect synthesis between colour, sound, editing and cinematography. Nowhere in the film is this more evident than in the legendary 17-minute ballet sequence, which uses all aspects of filmcraft to weave between the action and Vicky\u2019s psychological state. The influence of this sequence is clear in films like Hitchcock\u2019s Vertigo (1958).",

    "long_description": "Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Paci\ufb01c style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and e\ufb00ective insights. Tai refers to ocean waters, which represent your opportunity to rise through the ebb and \ufb02ow of this learning journey. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from di\ufb00erent communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from Voices from the Moana?\nIn Voices from the Moana, you will explore and share rich narratives of healing and resilience from different Pacific nations and perspectives. The Pacific ocean is a diverse place and we have our own unique stories of healing through traditional practices, beliefs and methods. This Talanoa Tai learning experience invites reflection on your own understanding of different healing modalities from the Pacific and the impact it has on your worldview. It will equip you to advocate for social justice through Pacific voices. You'll gain practical tolls and insights that you can apply directly to your work.\nThis is a 3 hour in-person learning experience.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\n Facilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives. Fa\u2019aeafale\u2019upolu (Polu) Samuelu is the facilitator of this Talanoa Tai Learning experience.",

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa.

    "long_description": "Join us for this fabulous event featuring three wild-swimming writers, each inspired in their own unique way by their connection to the ocean. Authors Ingrid Horrocks, Shona Riddell, and Kate Camp will be in conversation with host and wild swimmer extraordinaire Corrina Connor.\nMeet our panel:\nIngrid Horrocks is a writer whose work spans poetry, travel, environment, and community. Her many books include the memoir Where We Swim, described as \u201ca book about family that travels by water in the body of a swimmer\u201d, Women Wanderers, as well as two collections of poetry. Her new collection of short stories All Her Lives was published by Te Herenga Waka University Press in October.\nShona Riddell is an author, journalist, podcaster, and swimmer. Her books include Trial of Strength: Adventures and Misadventures on the Wild and Remote Subantarctic Islands and Guiding Lights: The Extraordinary Lives of Lighthouse Women, both published by Exisle Publishing. She has a Master's degree (Science in Society) and hosts a podcast called Swim Chats where she interviews swimmers, coaches, and marine scientists. Shona says: \u201cI like cold weather, being near the ocean (and swimming in it), and learning about remote locations\u201d.\nKate Camp is an award-winning poet and writer. Her first collection of poetry, Unfamiliar Legends of the Stars, won the NZSA Jessie Mackay Award for Best First Book of Poetry at the 1999 Montana New Zealand Book Awards, and she has gone on to publish six more poetry collections, most recently the wonderful Makeshift Seasons (2025). Kate is also a reviewer and essayist and is a familiar voice on Radio NZ.\nMeet our host:\nCorrina Connor is a marathon swimmer, cellist and one of our very own librarians. Be it the beaches or pools, libraries or music, Corrina makes the most of the opportunities P\u014dneke provides, in both work and play. In the past few years she has taken on several marathon swims, including Te Moana-o-Raukawa (Cook Strait), Te Ara-a-Kiwa (Foveaux Strait), and Lake Taup\u014d (a mere 40.2 kilometres); as well as undertaking several hypothermia-inducing \u2018ice swims\u2019, defined as swimming in water of five degrees or less.\nThis is a free event -- all welcome. Please note: we expect this event to be extremely popular, and seating will be on a first come first served basis. ",

Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\nISKRA\n\nIskra are an otherworldly quartet heralding from Te Whanganui-a-Tara formed by saxophonist Josh Buckler and featuring Simon Grove (Niko Ne Zna) on helicon, Ato Kwamena (Culture Embassy) on percussion and David McGurk (Planet Hunter) on drums.\n\nInspired by the likes of Sons of Kemet and the London jazz scene, they bring driving grooves, soaring melodies and the fire of afro-beat, Balkan music and a style that is best described as brass-house. Think dance party at the end of the world, when the last lights have gone out",

This immersive sound journey offers a deeply restorative experience that invites you to settle into stillness, reconnect with the heart, and explore a sense of inner spaciousness through vibration and tone.\nClaudio skilfully layers the sounds of gongs, crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, Native American flutes, and other traditional instruments, enhanced through high-quality audio equipment so the sound can be both heard and felt throughout your body.\nHarmonic sound and vibration offer the nervous system a chance to truly rest. In this state of relaxation, the thinking mind softens, and we find connection to citta \u2014 the heart-mind. From this place, silence arises naturally through the vehicle of sound.\nThis experience is open to everyone. No previous yoga or meditation practice is needed.\n\nWhat to bring:\nYou are welcome to bring your own yoga mat, though studio mats are also available. We will provide bolsters, blankets, and eye pillows for your comfort.\n\nBooking is essential \u2014 spaces are limited and this event often fills quickly.\n\nAbout Claudio\nClaudio is a multi-instrumentalist musician originally from Mexico City and now based in Wellington. Born into a family of musicians, he began playing music at a young age and later studied classical guitar. His journey led him to Montreal, where he explored jazz, world music, and spiritual sound traditions.\n\nExtensive travels in Asia and Europe deepened his connection with Indian music and yogic philosophy. He studied Tibetan singing bowls in Kathmandu and Varanasi, and has since worked with a wide range of instruments including the sitar, esraj, bansuri, harmonium, flutes, gongs, and voice.\n\nClaudio\u2019s work blends technical skill, deep presence, and a profound respect for the healing power of sound.\n\nLearn more or listen to Claudio\u2019s music here:\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/claudioescutiasounds\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/claudio_yoga_sound_healing\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/soundhealingyogamusicclaudio\n\n\n",

People have rejoiced, prayed and wept in it through happy family milestones and sad occasions, through two world wars and countless celebrations and crises. Along with its parish hall and tranquil garden, it has been the base for social and community services and outreach, and its memorial wall houses the ashes of local residents.\nBut in 2016 the congregation had to suddenly leave the church, which was deemed an earthquake risk.\nSince then, the parish has explored alternatives for continuing its life and service to the people of the eastern bays. In that process it has kept its ministry and worship going through borrowed premises in local schools and other churches. Now, however, the parish has decided it needs to go back to its original base and strengthen both St Alban\u2019s Church and the parish hall so it can continue to serve the community from its heart and home in Ngaio Street, for the next hundred years and more.\nDetailed plans for strengthening the church and hall to meet acceptable safety standards have been drawn up, and fund-raising is under way. The parish is a registered charity (CC22188) and tax-deductible receipts will be issued for all donations.\nPostponement by 1 day to 30 Nov if weather were to dictate and would be announced on this web site.",
    "description": "Step into a world of six acclaimed private gardens each a living canvas of colour, design and inspiration from lush natives to sculpted landscapes.\nThis is a chance not just to visit amazing gardens but support the earthquake strengthening of St Alban's historic church and hall for a rejuvenated community hub.\nSt Albans church garden The six private gardens all lie within a less than 100 m walk of the 83 Metlink Marine Parade bus route, but a car or bicycle would be more convenient.\nFor the last hundred years and more, this beautiful church designed by acclaimed architect Frederick de Jersey Clere has been the heart of Anglican parish life for people in the eastern bays of Wellington.\nAlong with its parish hall and tranquil garden, it has been the base for social and community services and outreach, and its memorial wall houses the ashes of local residents."

No previous yoga or meditation practice is needed.\nWhat to bring:\nYou are welcome to bring your own yoga mat, though studio mats are also available. We will provide bolsters, blankets, and eye pillows for your comfort.\nBooking is essential \u2014 spaces are limited and this event often fills quickly.\nAbout Claudio\nClaudio is a multi-instrumentalist musician originally from Mexico City and now based in Wellington. Born into a family of musicians, he began playing music at a young age and later studied classical guitar. His journey led him to Montreal, where he explored jazz, world music, and spiritual sound traditions.\nExtensive travels in Asia and Europe deepened his connection with Indian music and yogic philosophy. He studied Tibetan singing bowls in Kathmandu and Varanasi, and has since worked with a wide range of instruments including the sitar, esraj, bansuri, harmonium, flutes, gongs, and voice.\nClaudio\u2019s work blends technical skill, deep presence, and a profound respect for the healing power of sound.\nLearn more or listen to Claudio\u2019s music here:\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/claudioescutiasounds\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/claudio_yoga_sound_healing\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/soundhealingyogamusicclaudio\n",

The four were guests at many NZ festivals including the 1983 National Folk festival in Wellington, and recorded the legendary LP Hazy Days in 1985.\n\nAfter the group split up, they remained in contact and often performing and recording over the years.

Julian continued to write great songs including Far Far Away which became a NZ folk classic. Angela and Julian individually helped Chris on most of the many LPs and CDs he recorded over the years. However Angela had never sung on any of Julians songs, likewise for Julian with Angela's songs.\n\n\"though the three of us have been playing together for more than fourty years, we have never done a concert together, so we\u2019re looking forward to creating some magic at the bluegrass club\"\n- Chris Priestley",

It then focuses on the Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous geological periods, characterised by the appearance of the likes of scale trees, seed ferns and calamites.\u2026.and the swamp forests that gave rise to the production of coal. Then it advances to the Permian period, including Gondwana prior to its eventual breakup, and the beautiful, strange, gymnosperm Glossopteris that was widespread in the ancient southern continents, embracing what is now New Zealand/Aotearoa. Finally, it progresses to the world of \u2018living fossils\u2019 such as ginkgo and the even more primitive horsetails. Attention will be drawn to some of the animals that populated this ancient world.\n\nLocated in the Treehouse Seminar Room, Wellington Botanic Garden ki Paek\u0101k\u0101.\nFree of charge. You\u2019re welcome to bring along your own \u2018brown bag\u2019 lunch to enjoy during the talk.\n\nThe speaker is Reg Harris, a volunteer guide [botany] at Wellington Botanic Garden.\nReg delivers botany lectures for diverse audiences, delving into plant interactions, adaptive radiation, tropisms, and more.

    "long_description": "Working with a live model offers artists an invaluable opportunity to engage directly with the human form. The immediacy of the model\u2019s presence encourages close observation and instinctive decision-making, leading to work that is expressive and real. This hands-on interaction brings a sense of movement and authenticity that\u2019s hard to achieve otherwise.\n\nThe sculpting process typically starts by analyzing the model\u2019s proportions and pose. A wire armature is built to support the structure, and clay is gradually applied to develop the form to a one-third life size, 750mm tall figure. From there, the artist refines the shapes focusing on anatomical accuracy and expressive detail that give the sculpture its final character.\n\nPlease visit the website to know more about the event.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in traditional sculpture and the film industry, Javier is not just a sculptor \u2014 he\u2019s a mentor. Trained in classical techniques, he studied fine arts and took anatomy courses at medical school, developing a rare combination of artistic and anatomical knowledge. He spent over five years at the world-renowned Weta Workshop, contributing to major films and exhibitions, and has worked across materials, scales, and digital technologies.\n\nMaterial is included in the price.\n\nArmature is supplied during the workshop.\n\nYou can buy our tools during the workshop if you like.\n\nTea, Coffee & snacks will be available.\n\nWe do share meals during the workshop.\n\nRefunds are subjected to Terms & conditions",

Register to receive a Zoom link: https://dia-nz.zoom.us/.../WN_p6_8lW8vSyOLAnFYTHhOgw...\nA conversation with author Saraid de Silva\nThis year\u2019s Randell Cottage writers-in-residence are Titaua Peu (French writer-in-resident) and Saraid de Silva (New Zealand writer-in-resident).\nJoin Saraid de Silva in conversation with Randell Cottage trustee Francis Cooke. Saraid will also read from her new novel, which promises to be very different from her first and acclaimed book Amma. But how different will it be from Amma\u2019s stories that follow three generations of South Asian women? Saraid says her Untitled Second Novel is a revenge thriller about two best friends in a stolen car, crossing the country to crash a New Year\u2019s Eve party.\nVideo reflections from former writers in residence\nFollowing the conversation, French Cultural Counsellor, Fran\u00e7ois Bockel, will present the latest in the series of short videos of writers-in-residence reflecting on their experience at Randell Cottage. Titaua Peu was the French writer-in-residence earlier this year, and New Zealander Hinemoana Baker was the 2024 New Zealand writer-in-residence.\nThe videos form part of Randell Cottage\u2019s recorded oral history, designed to capture the essence of those writers and their interests while undertaking their fellowships.\nRSVP to let us know you are coming\nLight refreshments will be provided so RSVP before 1 December to info@randellcottage.co.nz.\nRandell Cottage writer\u2019s residency\nWellington\u2019s historic Randell Cottage has been a writers\u2019 residency for New Zealand and French writers since 2001. The Randell Cottage Writers Trust is supported by the New Zealand-France Friendship Fund/Arts Foundation of New Zealand, and the Wellington City Council. It works in close partnership with the Embassy of France.\nAbout the speakers\nSaraid de Silva is a Sri Lankan P\u0101keh\u0101 writer and arts worker based in T\u0101maki Makaurau. She was the co-creator and co-host of Radio New Zealand\u2019s podcast and video series Conversations with My Immigrant Parents and has recently worked as a storyliner, script writer, and script editor on New Zealand television shows. Her first novel, Amma, was released in New Zealand and Australia by Hachette New Zealand in March 2024 and in the UK by Weatherglass Books in April 2024. It was long-listed for the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Literature in the Ockham Awards and the UK Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction.\nTitaua Peu is a Tahitian novelist who stayed in Randell Cottage during the first half of 2025 as the French writer-in-residence. She is working on a new series of books that present a near future marked by a reverse migration, one in which inhabitants of Aotearoa have migrated north to the island of Mangareva in French Polynesia following a great war. The first laureate from French Polynesia, Titaua is considered one of the principal French-speaking voices in the literature of the Pacific, with her writings focusing on Polynesian society, the impact of colonialism and the place of women.",

    "long_description": "A bespoke Draw It Out workshop for Fertility NZ, open to all genders.\nTickets: $34.50pp\nTheme: Strengthen self-care for the holiday season\nStrengthen your inner resources to care for yourself over the holiday season, and meet others going through similar experiences through this online national workshop, using a gentle powerful tool called Interactive Drawing Therapy.\n\nFertilityNZ exists to support New Zealanders experiencing fertility problems, whether facing challenges becoming or staying pregnant. This bespoke workshop shares drawing for wellness, to tap into your inner guidance for support, within a safe space where others may be experiencing similar journeys.\nIncluded in your workshop\nYou will be guided by Lara Phillips, a trained creative facilitator in Interactive Drawing Therapy, through drawing prompts (similar to a guided meditation or journaling) to draw out where you are at and draw out your own inner guidance. No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\nWhat you will need\nAs this is an online workshop, you will need a computer in a comfortable, quiet setting. A hard surface to draw on (like a desk or a board), three to five pages of A3 paper (you can also tape two A4 printing papers together), and any colouring tools of your choice. Crayons are great as they are more child-like so you don't worry about how it looks. Coloured pastels or pencils are also good, or any coloured markers. The key is a range of colours.\n\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz.\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing. It is not intended as therapy nor does it replace counselling, therapy, or any other medical or clinical professional help. Participants are guided to draw out where they are at, whilst drawing out their own inner resources for support and guidance.\nParticipants understand it is their own responsibility to manage their mental and physical health during sessions, to opt in and out of activities as they see fit, and make the facilitator aware if further support is required.",

This hands-on interaction brings a sense of movement and authenticity that\u2019s hard to achieve otherwise.\n\nThe sculpting process typically starts by analyzing the model\u2019s proportions and pose. A wire armature is built to support the structure and clay is gradually applied to develop the form to a one-third life size 750mm tall figure. From there the artist refines the shapes focusing on anatomical accuracy and expressive detail that give the sculpture its final character.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in traditional sculpture and the film industry Javier is not just a sculptor \u2014 he\u2019s a mentor. Trained in classical techniques he studied fine arts and took anatomy courses at medical school developing a rare combination of artistic and anatomical knowledge. He spent over five years at the world-renowned Weta Workshop contributing to major films and exhibitions and has worked across materials scales and digital technologies.\n\nMaterial is included in the price.\nArmature is supplied during the workshop.\nYou can buy our tools during the workshop if you like.\nTea\n\nAlso check out other Workshops in Lower Hutt, Arts events in Lower Hutt, Fine Arts events in Lower Hutt.",

Some of New Zealand\u2019s most iconic rock musicians will tear through these legendary antipodean tracks in an all-out rock fest. You can decide who truly owns rock. Is it the swagger of Aussie pub rock or the grit and heart of Kiwi anthems? Perhaps it\u2019s both. \nGet ready to hear the biggest tunes from AC/DC, Split Enz, Cold Chisel, The Datsuns, INXS, DD Smash, Silverchair, Australian Crawl, and Hello Sailor. That\u2019s just for starters, so the showdown is set to be epic. Here\u2019s the kicker \u2014 you help shape the setlist, and when the amps power down, you vote for which nation takes home the crown. \nThis is more than a concert \u2014 it\u2019s a massive celebration of the music we grew up to, the songs that built us, and the riffs that still get us moving. Grab your mates, grab your tickets, and get ready to make some noise.",

Despite the repeated failure of standard policy processes, citizens assemblies have only recently made it to New Zealand. Register for this event to find out more about the Porirua Assembly on Climate and its innovations. \nPorirua is known for community-led innovations in governance and delivery, and the Porirua Assembly on Climate continued this tradition by being:\nthe first climate assembly in New Zealand,  \nthe first assembly co-designed and organised by an iwi authority and a community group, \nthe first assembly process designed to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi by using a tricameral design,  \nthe first New Zealand assembly to include children and young people, and \nby creating a new local governance body - the Porirua Community Leaders Forum - that sponsored the Assembly, holds its recommendations and can instigate ongoing community dialogue on local issues. \nPanellists will share learning on the Porirua Assembly\u2019s innovations, talk about why the standard citizens assembly model was modified, dig into what enabled so many firsts and how these worked out in practice. They will reflect on this legacy and possible future impacts. Might these democratic innovations strengthen local democracy elsewhere in Aotearoa New Zealand? \nAbout the Host and Speakers\nJodi Watene is a Systems Change Lead at Te R\u016bnanga o Toa Rangatira Incorporated, was the project manager for the Porirua Assembly and is helping to establish a New Zealand Community of Practice on Indigenous Citizens\u2019 Assemblies.\nMakerita Makapelu is a Team Leader for Wesley Community Action in Porirua with a background in performing arts and youth work. She specialises in community-led development and grassroots systems change, and was one of the Porirua Assembly facilitators.  \nCally O'Neill was a participatory designer of community spaces until 2019 when she shifted her focus towards advocating for Te Tiriti-based deliberative democracy to address the climate and other contemporary crises. She is a founding member of Te Reo O Ng\u0101 T\u0101ngata/The People Speak and was one of the Porirua Assembly facilitators. \nFuture Unity, a youth climate group formed during the Assembly process will be represented by Orini Rokx-Taratu and Santino Morehu, who were participants in the Assembly\u2019s youth and community streams.  \nEmily Beausoleil is an Associate Professor at Te Herenga Waka - Victoria University of Wellington. Her research as a political theorist centres on the dynamics, conditions and challenges of democratic engagement in diverse societies. She is conducting an independent evaluation of the Porirua Assembly process.",

Nuku is the Evelyn A. J. Hall and John A. Friede Curator for Oceanic Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\nWhat is the role and relevancy of museums in the 21st century? Are they living, expansive archives of Indigenous knowledge? Or outdated relics of colonial pasts.\nThe complete overhaul and construction of new galleries for the Arts of Oceania at The Metropolitan Museum in New York gave curator Maia Nuku a unique opportunity to reframe the galleries conceptually; to emphasize connectivity in the context of global and local histories; and elevate the equally critical arts of storytelling, oratory, and performance alongside Oceania\u2019s dynamic visual arts. Curator Maia Nuku shares insights into the 10-year project that has culminated in a suite of galleries that offer international visitors perspectives on art that reach deep into Oceania\u2019s past while also acknowledging ongoing manifestations of its agency in the present.\nBorn in London of English and M\u0101ori (Ngai Tai) descent, Dr. Maia Nuku is Curator for the Arts of Oceania at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She completed two post-doctoral fellowships at the University of Cambridge (2008-2014) as part of an international research team exploring Oceanic art collections in European museums in France, Spain, the Netherlands and Russia. Researching the collections alongside Pacific artists and practitioners, the work was collaborative and sought to create access to these collections both in the physical and digital domains. During her time at the Met, Maia has evolved a curatorial approach that centers indigenous Pacific perspectives, grounding the presentation of visual arts in the unique conceptual and cosmological connections that make art from Oceania so compelling. In 2023, her exhibition The Shape of Time: Art and Ancestors of Oceania travelled to Museum of Art in Pudong, Shanghai (June 1 - Aug 20, 2023) and National Museum of Qatar (Oct 23, 2023 - Jan 15, 2024).  For the past eight years, Maia has overseen a major reinstallation of the Oceania galleries at the Metropolitan Museum which showcases the creativity of indigenous Pacific artists from the 18th century to the present through the compelling lenses of global history, indigenous storytelling, and Pacific oratory and performance.",

He performs in various line ups and contexts; from intimate duo residencies, to headline performances as a bandleader showcasing his original music. He is often part of house bands for jam sessions around town, or as a sideman on other projects.\n\nIn 2023, Jamie completed a 10-date national tour around Aotearoa, including appearances at the Creative Jazz Club in Auckland and Hanover Hall in Dunedin. In between shows, Jamie recorded his debut album \u2018Monochrome\u2019, released in November 2024 on Good Twin Records.\n\nAs a composer, Jamie draws influence from all music and art forms, paying particular attention to the work of composers and bandleaders Brian Blade, Kendrick Scott, Petros Klampanis and Aaron Parks.

They\u2019re facing new challenges like hot flushes, grown up children, failed marriages and everything that comes with middle age! Sharon has managed to hang onto her wings and the others are still navigating life together. They re-live the past and reveal a couple of surprising secrets! But as always, the warmth of their friendship carries them through. Girls Night \u2013 The Reunion tells us that life is messy, but it\u2019s much easier to navigate with good friends.\n\nWe are lucky enough to have two of our original actors from Girls Night and Girls Night Too returning and are now looking for three more performers with strong singing voices to join them.\n\nEmail Jo at for more information and to book an audition time for SATURDAY 6 DECEMBER.\n\nShow dates are 16 - 26 April 2026\n\nCharacter descriptions:\nCarol is 50-something, confident, well dressed and likes a drink \u2013 the perpetual party girl! She was Sharon\u2019s best friend and has been married, divorced, married, divorced and married. Turns out she found the answer to marriage but didn\u2019t realise it. Well, we all kiss a lot of frogs before we find a prince\u2026Everyone knows and loves a Carol.\n\nAnita is 50-something, na\u00efve and uncensored and has had mental health issues all her life. The friends know about this but there\u2019s never been any deep discussion between them as to why this is\u2026such close friends but with hidden secrets. Her journey is like a rollercoaster. Will we find out at the reunion what Anita\u2019s secret is?\n\nKate is late 40\u2019s/early 50\u2019s and is Carol\u2019s little sister. She is quite prim and proper and a school teacher. Anita and Kate are quite close but despite issues with her sister Carol, the sisters are also close. Kate is quiet compared to the others but sticks with the friends. She is menopausal and with her hot flushes she\u2019s relying heavily on her fans! She is very determined and is definitely the kind one.\n\n\n",

You'll experience the opportunity to restore, recalibrate and realign your soul to its highest timeline for 2026 and beyond. This intimate event will have very limited capacity, to ensure a deep inward experience for all.\n\nWe will share in a sacred water ceremony with coherent water that has been structured, charged and infused with frequency- ready to be programmed with your intentions to release and shift into the new.\n\nNext, we will connect with a Triple Cone Orgonite meditation, further amplifying the Euphoria to all, energising your intentions and clearing the way for the shifts to come.\n\nWith awareness of breath and the rhythmic handpan drumming, you will gently be guided inward to begin your journey and actualize your intentions.\n\nThe heartbeat of the journey is a very special 30 year old handmade Buffalo drum from Utah, USA. Yana is the beat we move and breathe to, the guide and the gateway, the beat of Mother Earth. Allow her depth and resonance to take you to places you\u2019ve forgotten and re-introduce to you the primal heartbeat of humanity, of your humanity.\n\nAn intentional weaving of a multitude of instruments, beats and frequencies that will take you to places deep within yourself: an opportunity to explore, feel and release what no longer serves you. As we move into higher frequencies of consciousness as a collective, we are being called to clear the old- expectations, stories, beliefs, programs, conditioning and paradigms. You bring the intention and Yana will guide you into surrender, allowing all that does not serve your highest timeline to fall away.\n\nAnd as you gently re-emerge into the waking state, you'll experience the quiet and space to recalibrate and sink into the tenderness of renewal.\n\nThis journey is a sacred experience, designed to guide you through your own process. As such, this will mainly be a silent event (not social).\nContribution $55\nNameste\n\nNamaste\n\n",

You'll experience the opportunity to restore, recalibrate and realign your soul to its highest timeline for 2026 and beyond. This intimate event will have very limited capacity, to ensure a deep inward experience for all.\nWe will share in a sacred water ceremony with coherent water that has been structured, charged and infused with frequency- ready to be programmed with your intentions to release and shift into the new.\nNext, we will connect with a Triple Cone Orgonite meditation, further amplifying the Euphoria to all, energising your intentions and clearing the way for the shifts to come.\nWith awareness of breath and the rhythmic handpan drumming, you will gently be guided inward to begin your journey and actualize your intentions.\nThe heartbeat of the journey is a very special 30 year old handmade Buffalo drum from Utah, USA. Yana is the beat we move and breathe to, the guide and the gateway, the beat of Mother Earth. Allow her depth and resonance to take you to places you\u2019ve forgotten and re-introduce to you the primal heartbeat of humanity, of your humanity. \nAn intentional weaving of a multitude of instruments, beats and frequencies that will take you to places deep within yourself: an opportunity to explore, feel and release what no longer serves you. As we move into higher frequencies of consciousness as a collective, we are being called to clear the old- expectations, stories, beliefs, programs, conditioning and paradigms. You bring the intention and Yana will guide you into surrender, allowing all that does not serve your highest timeline to fall away.\nAnd as you gently re-emerge into the waking state, you'll experience the quiet and space to recalibrate and sink into the tenderness of renewal.\nThis journey is a sacred experience, designed to guide you through your own process. As such, this will mainly be a silent event (not social). We ask that you respect others by refraining from socializing in the space.\nNamaste\nMystic Creative",

His well-honed ability to work a dance floor and his eclecticism are what has got him there. A decade or so after breaking out, he\u2019s now matured as a DJ and producer to the point where he has the confidence to lead his crowd wherever he wants and they always go with him wherever he plays. Synonymous with long sets and an innate ability to read a crowd, his immediate early impact led to high-profile gigs as soon as he arrived on the scene.\nHe is now perfectly at home at places like fabric, Circoloco, WHP, Glasgow's very own Sub Club and many more alongside a who's who of the underground scene. It's almost impossible to define his sound, switching between heavy, swing-fuelled house, fizzing techno tools and twitchy minimal wig-outs. Essentially, what you get from Jasper James are stripped-back solid grooves that make people move. Releasing on labels ranging from Optimo Trax and ESP Institute through to No Art, as well as his own Mitchell Street Records imprint, the quality remains high because releases only come when James truly connects with them. With a flurry of new music currently in the pipeline, Jasper James remains as vital a presence in the underground as ever.\nJasper is more certainly one of the finest selectors in the world.\nMake an evening of it and come for a late afternoon drink or meal - and get into the groove when the beats start.\nEarly doors, early night.\nSaturday 6 December - 7pm to 1am\nLock in the date for your dose of sonic essence.\nHouse through to techno and beyond.",

And good luck with that.\n\nBuddha is a b-i-g fan of the Slow Down Movement.\n\nWhen we slow down in meditation, for example, we give ourselves the chance to absorb.\nWhen we slow down in daily life, we give ourselves the chance to respond to people, events, thoughts, etc. with wisdom and empathy.\nWe regain crucial control over our own mind and our own actions. If you feel that your world is slipping out of your control, please join us for some teachings on Buddha\u2019s advice for how to shift into a lower gear, in life and in meditation.\n\nEveryone is welcome.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nThese classes are based on Buddha\u2019s teachings on the mind, but you do not need to be a Buddhist to attend, or to benefit from them. There is no physical exercise involved and you can choose to sit either in a chair or on a cushion. These classes are suitable for all levels of experience.\n\nRegistration starts at 9:30am. This course includes a vegan, wheat-free morning tea (we cannot guarantee gluten-free).\n\n",

Because I work and hold space within a high vibrational field, everyone present is able to access, attune to, and receive these elevated frequencies too - opening a gateway to higher states of awareness and multidimensional reconnection.\nThis is a multi-layered energetic journey that will support your soul\u2019s evolution and empower you with tools to continue accessing these frequencies whenever you need them.\n\nIn Ancient Atlantean Times...\nHealing was simple.\nPeople would sit before sacred, light-infused paintings, allowing frequency, sound, and intention to restore balance and harmony.\nI\u2019m bringing this ancient practice back.\n\nJoin me for a group Healing Session in Wellington \u2022 a beautiful multidimensional experience for deep new-code absorption, renewal, and alignment. You\u2019ll sit in sacred space before my Pleiadian Portal Painting, surrounded by gentle frequency music, sipping ceremonial Kakao, and immersed in high-vibrational energy.\nEach person will receive a clearing and then be guided through a powerful meditation and activation, with time to journal and share afterwards.\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s Included in This Sacred Attunement Journey\n\u2022 Individual Galactic Clearing\nWe begin by preparing your field for higher frequencies. Each participant will receive a personal energy clearing to release stagnant or lower vibrations, supported by channeled light language to open you to deeper transformation.\n\n\u2022 Heart-Opening Kacao Ceremony\nOnce the clearing is complete, we\u2019ll share a gentle ceremonial Kacao experience to expand the heart, deepen receptivity, and create a sacred container for Pleiadian frequencies to flow through.\n\n\u201cRaise Your Vibration\u201d Pleiadian Wisdom Talk\nI\u2019ll share insights into who the Pleiadians are, their role in humanity\u2019s awakening, and how their joyous, supportive energy can help you in everyday life. You\u2019ll also receive simple, powerful tools to help you reconnect with this frequency long after our circle.\n\n\u2022 Guided Meditation & Activation\nWe journey through a deeply guided meditation supported by my Pleiadian Encoded Artwork and light language transmissions. This works on a soul level to activate deeper layers of your light body, anchor wisdom, and align you with higher frequencies. The energetic transmission continues to integrate long after the session.\n\n\u2022 Personal Angelic Attunement & Integration\nTo complete our journey, each participant will receive a personal ANGELIC attunement to anchor the frequencies received and integrate them into their unique energetic system, supporting lasting transformation and soul alignment.\n\n\u2022 Why This Circle is Unique\nThis is an intimate, boutique-style event limited to just 10 participants to ensure a deeply personal and supportive experience for everyone. Smaller groups allow me to focus the energy on each individual, maximising the depth and potency of the transformation you\u2019ll receive.\nYou will leave feeling uplifted, attuned, and supported \u2014 and with the ability to reconnect with these higher frequencies whenever you need.\nTo help extend and nurture the energy beyond the circle, supportive tools will be available and to order - including aura sprays, light-encoded scarves, and art prints, so you can continue to connect with and access the Pleiadian frequencies in your own space.\n\nEvent Details\nDate: Sunday, 7 December 2025\nLocation: Whitby, Wellington (address supplied upon booking)\nTime: 4:00 PM \u2013 6:00 PM\nExchange: NZ$65\nMaximum Group: 10 participants only \u2014 early booking is recommended.\n\n",

It is a great chance to support young talent, enjoy beautiful images and be part of a welcoming creative community.\nBring your friends and wh\u0101nau.

Return could therefore either be 1:30 or 2:30 with the latest return to Titahi Bay being 3pm.\n\nWe've made this event later than the normal SKISL so that it's easier for folks to drive down from Palmerston North, and also because it is a lunch event.\n\nThe lawn on Mana is really nice, sheltered and pleasant and there are also good walks. Mana is of course a sanctuary so you must check your boats for any wildlife especially ants that may have gotten in past the hatches. Also we cannot have any fires\n\nPlan B: If weather nukes Mana, we'll try for Green Point or Onehunga Bay in Whitireia Park by driving there.\n\nPlan C: We will postpone to 21 December\n\nAlso check out other Workshops in Porirua.",

    "long_description": "Somatic: Of or relating to the body, particularly the perception of physical sensations and internal experiences\n\nWhat does it feel like to exist in a queer body? This workshop aims to help sapphic women and gender minorities find joy, freedom, and connection through somatic exercises that help you embody and embrace your queerness. You will leave feeling confident in your ability to take up space, tapped into your self-expression, and connected to the experiences of your sapphic community.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of what to expect:\n- Opening Exercise: Guided somatic movements to loosen up your body\n- Community Connection: Rotating conversations with other participants about queer embodiment\n- Yoga Flow: Creative 30 minute class to explore presence and connect to your self-expression\n- Guided Meditation: A relaxing combination of breathwork and visualisation to cultivate safety in your body\n- Closing Connection: Gentle and grounding partner stretches (optional) and group reflections\n\nNo prior experience with yoga or somatic exercises necessary! All you need to attend is an open attitude, a desire to connect with your body, and a willingness to share your experience with other sapphics. Yoga mats and all other props will be provided. While this workshop dives into your embodied expression of sapphic identity/sexuality, none of the content is sexual in nature and the small amount of physical touch with other participants is completely optional.\n\nThe workshop is facilitated by Megan Edwards, creator of Golden Hour Gigs and a 500CYT trauma-informed yoga teacher. This event is intended specifically for queer women and gender minorities. No TERFS no SWERFS.\n\nContent consideration: Because this workshop focuses on finding joy/pleasure/freedom in your body, it might not be suited for anyone experiencing intense dysphoria. With that said, you are welcome to explore discomfort and work on integrating challenging feelings. Megan is trained in movement techniques to lead you away from anything too activating and help you find safety in your body.\n\nAccessibility: Awhi Yoga Studios has an elevator and is wheelchair accessible. There are plenty of gender neutral bathrooms and cosy spaces to rest if you need a break from the workshop at any time. If you want to attend but are concerned about the level of movement required, please email the organiser with any mobility questions at goldenhourgigz@gmail.com",

Saturday 13th of December, the band will take the stage at Auckland\u2019s glorious Hollywood Avondale for an all-ages show, playing Meow in Wellington on Sunday 14th December.\n\nAfter bursting onto the scene with two incredible albums in a single year - the brilliant Tracey Denim and the noisy niceness of The Twits - bar italia spent the next while earning a reputation as one of the best live bands in the game, including a sold out and sweaty show at Auckland\u2019s Neck of the Woods. Since then, the band have been plotting their next move in world domination, dropping fan favourite single Cowbella in June, and this week lifting the lid on Some Like It Hot with accompanying tune Fundraiser - with a video featuring Matt \u201cSuper Hans\u201d King.\n\nThe London based band, built around the core of Nina Cristante, Jezmi Tarik Fehmi and Sam Fenton, may have looked to be hiding out this year while cooking up this new batch of tunes, but in reality they\u2019ve been anything but dormant. Cristante teamed up with Yves Tumor for a dangerously good duet on We Don\u2019t Count, while Jezmi and Sam dropped another full-length album under their Double Virgo moniker just last month.\n\nWith the album dropping on Matador this October, local fans will have a couple of short months to learn the words and get ready to scream and swoon along when bar italia hit our shores this December. Shit yeah!\n\n",

We are so proud to be #5 on the IMNZ Chart. Independent artists are the grassroots and lifeblood of Kiwi music. And there\u2019s only been a few local indie blues-rock albums on the Official Aotearoa Music Charts over the last decade \u2013 our mate Grant Haua in 2022, and Troy Kingi in 2016, so we\u2019re stoked to be here and rep the Blues in 2025!\u201d\nThe tight, three piece blues rock outfit of band members Brad McMillan (drums), Stu Duncan (bass), and Brian Baker (guitar / vocals)  have garnered a reputation for their powerful and moving live performances, drawing comparisons to Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter, Peter Green and Jeff Beck, while firmly putting their own stamp on the timeless medium that is the blues.\nBB & The Bullets have released three well received singles to date off the album: debut single \u2018Something In The Water\u2019; album title track \u2018High Tide\u2019; and their blues-soaked rendition of the Beatles classic \u2018I Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy)\u2019 which is a huge fan favourite at their live shows. To date, all three singles have enjoyed some excellent blues radio attention, including airplay on Radio New Zealand and around the country, as well as in Germany, USA, and Canada, with \u2018High Tide\u2019 charting at #4 on Roots Music Charts in Australia, achieving #1 on the Roots Music Report Blues Album Chart, #1 on the Blues Rock Album Chart and three songs on the Blues Singles chart.\nHome country of their label Dixiefrog Records has plenty of great things to say about BB & The Bullets, with Paris Move Magazine giving the album a very favourable review, ranking it as a \u2018red heart\u2019 favourite, as has French outlet Zicazic Magazine, and the title track single \u2018High Tide\u2019 has made the weekly playlist of Rolling Stone Magazine, France.\n\u201cThis album proves to be a declaration of love to the roots of the blues, driven by striking live energy and unabashed virtuosity.\u201d \u2013 Zicazic Magazine, France\nWith a well-deserved reputation for their compelling live shows, BB & The Bullets audiences are always wowed by the power and intensity of their performances.\nWith this chart action, it is evident that the blues scene is alive and vibrant on Antipodean shores, grab your mates and don\u2019t miss your chance to check out a blues-rock experience like no other with BB & The Bullets!",

The beginning of the year is a perfect time to get together and feel the power of community and connection through singing.\nSing for renewal and hope. Sing for harmony, joy, and inspiration. Sing for healing. Sing to regain your strength and empower others.\nSpend the 2 days encircled by a community of like-minded people and focusing on your well-being through singing. Rest, connect, and restore. The weekend is carefully planned so there is plenty of time to sing and to rest in between.\nWe will breathe together, listen, create beautiful sounds, let go of our worries, and lift each other to a sense of fulfillment and joy. And to make the event even more special, Lala will be cooking an authentic Malagasy dinner on Saturday night (an experience not to be missed).\nJonathan Berkahn and Lala Simpson have been working together, leading workshops and performing for many years. They are both highly skilled song leaders who lead from the heart and joyfully share their gifts. You will be in safe hands. ALL SINGERS OF ALL LEVELS OF ABILITY ARE WELCOME!!!\nJonathan will teach a mix of pop, folk and original songs, and Lala will teach a mix of songs from South Africa, Georgia, Madagascar and community songs.\nIf you are coming from out of town, the Home of Compassion offers some accommodation with reasonable rates which includes breakfast. Please contact them directly to enquire islandbay@compassion.org.nz\nSCHEDULE\nSaturday, 17th of January: This first part of the retreat will be at the Island Bay Presbyterian Church. We will spend the day singing in the beautiful auditorium and share a Malagasy meal cooked by Lala at the end of the day. Morning tea, afternoon tea, and dinner provided. Please BYO lunch.\nSunday 18th of January: We will be singing in the Lyon Room at the Home of Compassion in Island Bay.

    "long_description": "Acclaimed Irish band Beoga will make their long-awaited return to New Zealand in January 2026, performing two intimate headline shows in Auckland and Wellington.\nKnown for their adventurous spirit and willingness to chart new musical territory, Beoga have redefined the possibilities of Irish traditional music. Their global reach was cemented through collaborations with Ed Sheeran on the record-breaking \u00f7 (Divide) album, including the smash hits \u201cGalway Girl\u201d and \u201cNancy Mulligan.\u201d The former has now surpassed 1.4 billion streams on Spotify alone.\nAfter a four-year hiatus from touring and releasing music, Beoga made a powerful comeback earlier this year with their new album Phases, released in June. The band went on to perform at Glastonbury and Coachella, where they shared the stage with Shaboozey, Alex Warren, and Ed Sheeran at his now-famous Old Phone Pub pop-up experience.\nWith a GRAMMY nomination, international tours, and collaborations with some of the biggest names in music, Beoga have established themselves as one of Ireland\u2019s most exciting and genre-blurring acts. Their sound fuses accordion, fiddle, keyboards, guitars, and vocals into a vibrant, modern take on Irish roots music that feels both timeless and new.\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License. Minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.",

The focus is on camping, coffee, and having a fun time with relatively short kayaking times on the water.\n\nThe schedule for Wellingtonians is: on the Thursday 29th Ferry over to Picton, in at 12:30, launch from Picton beach head over to Kumoto, tents up, Friday - paddle around the Bay of Many Coves, stop for coffee / lunch / chips / shower at Punga Cove, stay at Camp Bay. Maybe a quick trip over to Bumine Island with empty boats. Saturday night at Ratimira for camping / snoozing. Sunday - up early, on water at 8am, paddle back to Picton in by 12, lunch, on 1pm sailing. So 4 days with Blumine as an optional paddle, mostly shortish trips. We might shift the plan around depending on the weather, but that sets out the general plan.\n\nFor the ferry you need to book your own tickets and I would urge you to get your ferry tickets now as they go fast. If you are concerned about the weather get the fully refundable tickets. When you buy your ticket select the \"kayak\" option. Any questions ask them in the comments below.\n\nAlso check out other Trips & Adventurous Activities in Wellington.",

Visceral and cathartic shows where crushing riffs & sprawling drones collide with extended bursts of wild improvisation. In 2024, the band released their critically acclaimed album The Healer, a sweeping, transformative work spanning four monumental tracks. The record dives deep into themes of regeneration, suffering, and spiritual reconstruction \u2014 a testament to the band\u2019s ability to meld raw power with emotional depth.\n\nThe experimental metal trio\u2019s four-song, 76-minute album is the peak of their career. It\u2019s dense and invigorating, highlighting the band\u2019s dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. - Pitchfork\n\nSoon after the release SUMAC teamed up with poet and sound artist Moor Mother to release The Film, a boundary-pushing collaborative album. Released via Thrill Jockey in April 2025, the record unfolds as a cinematic journey across eight \u201cscenes,\u201d merging SUMAC\u2019s heavy, jazz-inflected textures with Moor Mother\u2019s incisive spoken-word commentary. \n\nSUMAC\u2019s work has always been about transition between different states of being. Our sense of normal, and indeed our sense of life, is now being shaken. We don\u2019t know what is coming next. We are looking for pointers towards the future, as well as things to hold onto in the moment. \nNew Zealanders, don\u2019t miss this rare and powerful journey into uncharted sonic terrain.",

    "long_description": "On the 12 February 1909, the SS Penguin sank in Cook Strait in a raging southerly storm with the loss of 72 lives, one of the worst maritime disasters in NZ history.  Many of those who died were woman and children, as their lifeboats capsized in the wild sea. \nAlthough the Captain was heavily criticised, it is still not clear what the ship hit nor where, as the wreck of the Penguin has never been located. \nThe tragedy stunned Wellington and a day of mourning was called for 16 February.  The city came to a standstill as many of those who died were brought up to Karori Cemetery for burial in a long procession of cabs and lorries.\nTo commemorate this tragedy the Friends will be undertaking a guided tour of most of the Penguin graves on Sunday 8th February. \nThe tour duration is approximately 2 hours long.\nThis tour is suitable for people with moderate fitness. The route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. Surefootedness is required.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee). Children under 12 are free.\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nNote:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you one hour before the tour start time by email and on our Facebook page. The booking fee is non-refundable.\nPlease dress appropriately for the conditions. While we do our best to guide you on a safe walking route, during the winter months the ground can become slippery in places.\nSome of our walks require a moderate degree of fitness and are not suited for those with limited mobility. Please read the tour descriptions carefully to check that they will be suitable for you.\nThere is only one toilet which is located by the cemetery office at the main entrance.\nPlease meet us at the shelter (shown as the Historic Chapel on the map at the main entrance)\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Karori Cemetery.",

    "long_description": "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention initially developed for emotional disorders. It is now widely used in supporting people to deal with the challenges of physical ill-health. Professionals from various backgrounds can learn to use a simplified CBT skills set, and use of these skills enables them to be more effective in managing aspects of their patients\u2019 distress.\nThe training is a mix of theory, skills demonstration and skills practice, giving participants a better understanding of the applicability of the skill set in their area of practice and providing some skills to take away. Training sessions are spaced to allow participants to use their new skills in their clinical practice. Each participant reflects on their learning and their work with a specific patient, and the whole group reflects on lessons learned. In this way, learning remains rooted in participants\u2019 clinical practice. These CBT courses are consistently evaluated highly by participants.\nThe Course\nTeaching will be commenced with 2 days of in person sessions. 19th and 20th Feb 2026 at Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington and subsequently 2 sessions on-line via Zoom. These will be either 18th or 19th March an 22nd or 23rd April 2026.\nAttendance at all sessions is mandatory to complete the course.\nThe courses cost is $850 per person (incl GST).\nThe Trainers\nKathy Burn was a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Palliative Care who went on to train in CBT and to develop the CBT service at St Christopher\u2019s Hospice, London. She now works in CBT in chronic pain, and she teaches and supervises CBT trainees at the institute of Psychiatry, London.\nKathryn Mannix was a Palliative Medicine Consultant and CBT therapist. She developed \u2018CBT First Aid\u2019 to enable palliative care clinicians to adapt skills from CBT into their clinical practice. She is an author. There are insights into her use of CBT in her books With the End in Mind and Listen.\nTerms and Conditions\nAttendance: In order to create a learning community for each course, it is important that each person on a course attends every session and is able to join in the discussions by keeping up with the course. By accepting a place on a particular course, you agree to attend all the sessions, to arrive on time, and to work alongside your group members during the session to support each other's learning. Each session builds on the last, and you'll be asked to put your new learning into practice in- between sessions. Building learning groups in this way means we can't add new trainees after a course has begun.\nWe are not able to run catch-up sessions for sessions missed. If you miss sessions, you may be asked to withdraw from the course and no refunds will be given.\nRefunds/Canellations: Once you sign up and pay, we won't be able to refund your payment unless we can reallocate your place to another person before the course begins. The deadline for cancelling your place is 28 days before the day and time of the first session. If you cancel and we can fill your place with another person, we'll offer you the choice of a refund or a place on a future course, if places are available. We will do our best to fill your place, but we can't promise this. Refunds will incur an administration fee.\nDates and Times of Sessions: all dates and times are given in NZ time, and this varies over the year. It is up to you to check the correct time in your time zone: you may find this website useful to check your own time zone with Auckland NZ time on each specific date: https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/\nTrainers: we have a team of trainers, all of whom are experienced CBT therapists and trainers, and all are familiar with applying CBT in physical health settings. Different sessions may be taught by different trainers, or by 'guest appearances' by some of our team. The team of trainers will ensure there is continuity of content and of learning as the course progresses.\nSpecial circumstances: Sometimes, life events appear unexpectedly. If something unexpected prevents you from attending, please let us know as early as you can, and we will give consideration to how we might be able to support you to continue your training if that is what you wish to do.",

Following his most recent EP release of covers, Making Good Time \u2013 a collaboration with Ben Bridwell (Band of Horses), and his 2024 full length album Light Verse, Iron & Wine come to Australia off the back of a huge US tour with award-winning trio I\u2019m With Her and Seattle favourites Band of Horses.\nFor more than a decade, Iron & Wine has crafted a body of work spanning seven studio albums, numerous EPs and singles, each marked by atmospheric arrangements, poetic storytelling, and Sam Beam\u2019s singular voice. From modest beginnings with The Creek Drank the Cradle, through the rustic beauty of The Shepherd\u2019s Dog, the bold explorations of Kiss Each Other Clean and Ghost on Ghost, to the reflective resonance of Beast Epic and the orchestral sweep of Light Verse, Iron & Wine has earned acclaim for its capacity to move between the hushed and the grand with elegance and emotional clarity.\nIron & Wine will perform solo, playing stripped back music from his expansive catalogue including songs from latest album Light Verse, fan favourites from his collaborations with Calexico and I\u2019m With Her, and the cinematic gems such as the slow dance soundtrack from Twilight.",

The huge contribution of Dr Karen Grylls is celebrated in \u2018Ara Hura \u2014 A Visionary Journey\u2019. \nIt\u2019s fitting that this Aotearoa Festival of the Arts concert involves the choir Dr Grylls founded 28 years ago. Voices New Zealand debuted with a concert at the same festival in 1998. It has gone on to build a reputation for excellence in the music world. For this celebratory concert, the choir is joined by taonga p\u016boro artist Horomona Horo, leading instrumentalists, and a chamber ensemble from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. \nThe concert centrepiece is Robert Wiremu\u2019s Re-imagined Mozart: Erebus. The programme also features a new commission from Takerei Komene, as well as waiata by Ng\u0101p\u014d and Pimia Wehi. This highlights Dr Grylls\u2019 pioneering collaborations that reshaped Aotearoa\u2019s choral landscape. Her expertise as a choral clinician is sought internationally, and she regularly conducts masterclasses and workshops in Wales, England, North America, Canada and Australia. \nThis marks Dr Grylls\u2019 final appearance as Music Director of Voices New Zealand. It\u2019s a rare opportunity to celebrate her vision, artistry, and legacy.",

Playing Wellington\u2019s San Fran on Saturday 11 April, followed by The Powerstation in Auckland on Sunday 12 April. \nTickets on sale Thursday 2 October 12pm from helmetmusic.com\nHelmet has built a reputation as one of the most commanding forces in the underground scene.

    "long_description": "Day 1 \u2013 May 10, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: Working with Dissociative Parts and Their Voices in Complex Trauma and Dissociative Disorders\nOverview:\nThis seminar focuses on adapting EMDR for individuals with dissociative disorders, using the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) Dolores has developed. It provides strategies for working with dissociative parts and their voices and integrating a trauma-informed approach to inner conflict safely from early treatment stages.\nKey Learning Points:\n\u00b7         Identifying and working with dissociative parts and their voices.\n\u00b7         Understanding the function and purpose of \u201chostile\u201d parts.\n\u00b7         Addressing dissociative phobias through EMDR informed techniques.\n\u00b7         Managing resistance and treatment impasses.\n\u00b7         Structuring work with dissociative parts effectively.\nProgram Description:\nAfter many early cautions about the potential dangers of using EMDR with individuals suffering from dissociative disorders, limited methods have been offered for adapting standard EMDR procedures to this specific population. Based on these early cautions, EMDR is still considered by many clinicians as limited to the treatment of traumatic memories in high-functioning dissociative clients and only after a long preparation phase that depends on other treatment modalities. Confined by this conceptualisation, the use of EMDR is too often limited, and many survivors of severe traumatisation are unable to benefit from EMDR reprocessing and, if at all, only much later in the treatment process.\nDolores Mosquera developed (with AnabelGonzalez, M.D.) the Progressive Approach model for treating complex trauma and dissociation (2012) and the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) (2019, 2025). Using this trauma and AIP-informed models, clinicians can safely utilise a wide range of EMDR interventions (including BLS) from early in the preparatory phase of treatment for patients with dissociative disorders.\nIn this seminar, she will present her current practice of working with clients, including video demonstrations. Mosquera's deft clinical skills and ground-breaking innovative thinking teach a middle ground between \"dissociation blind\" aggressive EMDR interventions and overly cautious delays to the use of EMDR reprocessing.\nMany dissociative clients have difficulty with hostile, critical voices. The internal conflict is sometimes so intense that the person even has difficulty carrying on an ordinary conversation. One factor that affects this conflict is how the patient deals with the voices or parts of the self.\nKey Program Content:\nIdentify the internal system of dissociation and internal voices that are hostile and critical\nHow to read the function and purpose behind the saboteur parts of self\nUsing compassion and understanding to help deal with dissociative phobias within the internal system\nSkills to reduce impasses and resistance that may complicate or reduce the efficacy of the treatment\nSpecific steps to organize the work with hostile parts and voices\n Days 2\u20133 \u2013 May 11\u201312, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: From Fragmentation to Integration: A Master Class in Treating Complex Trauma and Dissociation\nFormat: 2-Day Masterclass: Three Clinical Cases from Start to Finish\nAcross two days, Dolores will present three distinct new cases illustrating varying levels of dissociation \u2014 including one with frequent switching and no initial Adult Self. Each session is interactive, highlighting the therapeutic process from assessment to completion.\nOver two immersive days, this advanced master class offers a rare opportunity to observe and analyse complete therapeutic processes under the expert guidance of Dolores Mosquera.\n\nDolores will present three new and distinct clinical cases, each representing different manifestations of complex trauma and dissociation \u2014 including one client who experiences frequent switching and begins therapy without an integrated adult self.\nParticipants will follow these clients\u2019 journeys from the initial stages of therapy through to treatment completion, gaining deep insight into decision-making, pacing, and the integration of EMDR strategies within complex systems. The format is designed to be highly interactive and reflective, combining video demonstrations, live commentary, and group discussion to deepen understanding of safe, flexible, and attuned clinical practice when working with dissociative clients.\nThis master class is ideal for clinicians seeking to refine their skills, expand their conceptual framework, and enhance clinical confidence when navigating the challenges of trauma-related dissociation.\nAdditional Details\n\u00b7         Eligibility: Must have completed at least Part One of EMDR Basic Training (University of Otago or equivalent).\n\u00b7         Certification: Participants receive a Professional Development Certificate of Attendance.\n\u00b7         Dietary needs: Provided upon registration.\n\u00b7         Parking: Paid on-site parking available.\n\u00b7         Accommodation: Discounted rates at a local hotel (discount code to be posted on the event site).",

    "long_description": "Meet Getdown Services \u2013 your new favourite band and one of the UK\u2019s hottest word-of-mouth acts! The brilliantly offbeat cult British duo has been turning heads across Britain and Europe with their balls-to-the-walls live shows, tongue-in-cheek wit, razor-sharp lyrics and infectious disco-fuelled grooves, teetering between chaos and genius. And now, after selling out tours across the UK and Europe, they\u2019re bringing their riotous show down under for the first time in May/June 2026 \u2013 with shows in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Wellington, presented by I OH YOU and MG Live. \nTickets go on sale Friday 14 November at 10.00am local time, with MG Live presale commencing Thursday 13 November at 10.00am local time. Sign up for early access to the MG Live presale here.               \n\u201cI reckon we get people asking us to come to Australia probably every day, and everyone in England is moving there, so will be good to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\u201cAlways been one of those places where you\u2019re like, \u2018Fair enough, but I can\u2019t be arsed with that. It looks mad \u2013 there\u2019s snakes and also it takes 40 hours to get there.\u2019 Will be good fun, though! Went to New Zealand to see a mate of ours get married a few years ago and thought it was a lovely country and I really liked those pies they have. It felt quite similar to the UK in a lot of ways, so playing gigs there should be fun!\u201d\nGetdown Services\n\nFor those in the know, Bristol-based duo Josh Law and Ben Sadler \u2013 aka Getdown Services \u2013 are THE must-see new act of the year. And if you don\u2019t know yet, you will soon \u2026 and you\u2019ll wish you got in early! Named as \u201cone to watch\u201d at this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival and dubbed (by the band themselves) \u201cBritain\u2019s Best Band\u201d, their live shows are equal parts smart, sweaty and gloriously unhinged. Their sound is a wild blend of scrappy indie disco, twisted funk and post-punk energy, turning the absurdity of modern Britain into dancefloor gold.        \n \nThe pair met at school in Minehead, Somerset and now make music together at home in Bristol \u2013 churning out what Rolling Stone called \u201cpower disco with unrepentant silliness\u201d with a healthy dose of satire and swagger. Their highly lauded debut album Crisps (Breakfast Records, 2023) showcased their eclectic danceable grooves and biting social commentary, and a mix of sharp, funny social observations wrapped in irresistible, funk-fuelled rhythms. Follow-up EPs Your Medal\u2019s In The Post, Crumbs and latest, Primordial Slot Machine, cemented their cult status, alongside an arsenal of red-hot singles \u2013 including James Bay\u2019s Hat, Dog Dribble, I Got Views and Eat Quiche, Sleep, Repeat.   \n \n \u201cGetdown Services are unrepentantly silly and constantly deliver one of the most joyously deranged live shows \u2013 just one of the best live bands out there!\u201d\n Rolling Stone\n\u201cTheir live show is as daft and as exhilarating as they come. Five stars.\u201d\n Buzz Magazine\n \n \u201cGenuine contenders to being the most exciting and interesting band in the UK right now.\u201d\n CLASH\n\n Getdown Services look set to gobble up the world, one crumb at a time. Whether you\u2019re into danceable chaos, satirical genius or just want to be ahead of the curve, Getdown Services are the band you didn\u2019t know you needed \u2013 until now! Britain\u2019s favourite new band are about to become yours too! \n\nMG LIVE TERMS OF SALE\n\nhttps://mg.live/termsofsale",

Emergence is the latest show by English physicist, presenter, and personality Professor Brian Cox. He takes to the stage at TSB Arena to contemplate the dazzling complexity of the universe and how it\u2019s built on profoundly simple principles. \nEmergence is also a scientific history of 400 years of human discovery. How did we come to understand so much about the cosmos? Guided by mathematics, curiosity, and an aesthetic sense of symmetry, our species has begun to read the story of the Universe. We\u2019ve started to carry our spacecraft to the edge of the solar system and outwards to the stars. Brian\u2019s engaging style makes these questions come to life. The audience will be left awestruck and thrilled as the show covers vast topics in an accessible way. \nBrian has appeared in many landmark science programs for BBC radio and television over the last 15 years, from the Peabody Award-winning Wonders of the Solar System to the worldwide hit series The Planets. His previous touring show, Horizons, was performed to nearly half a million people across the world.",

It follows Figaro and his bride-to-be, Susannah, on their wedding day. Figaro\u2019s employer, Count Almaviva, tries to seduce Susanna, so the engaged couple seek revenge. The cast boasts an unbelievable wealth of talent from Aotearoa and Australia, including runner-up at the 2022 Lexus Song Quest Felicity Tompkins, Julien Van Mellaerts, and James Clayton. \nTrans-Tasman creative duo Lindy Hume and Tracy Grant Lord take the helm with direction and design while Orchestra Wellington and conductor James Judd lead from the pit. This season offers opera at its most gorgeous, its most vivid, its most unforgettable.",

    "long_description": "After three years of closure, the newly renovated and strengthened City Gallery Wellington Te Whare Toi will host the art of Cornelia Parker. The English visual artist is best known for her innovative and contemporary sculpture and installation art. Her large-scale, immersive installations explore themes of destruction and reconstruction, transformation and metamorphosis. Objects are exploded, crushed, and suspended in a world upended and remade anew.\nCurated by independent UK-based curator Andrea Schlieker and City Gallery Wellington\u2019s Senior Curator Aaron Lister, City Gallery Wellington's exhibition will encompass Parker\u2019s long career as an artist. This includes an immersive sound and light installation, \u2018Stolen Thunder\u2019. The work gathers the sounds of approaching storms from around the globe and across time. The exhibition will also showcase her paintings, photos, films, and sculptures.\n\u201cI have always said this is the one exhibition I want to do before I die,\u201d said Charlotte Davy, Ringatohu Toi Director Art and City Gallery Wellington. \u201cI have been following Cornelia Parker\u2019s work for the last twenty years. Bringing her mischievous, dark, and literally explosive work to Wellington is incredible.\u201d \nParker\u2019s work often fills entire rooms and invites the viewer to move through and around the art. Given its physical scale, the blank canvas of the reopened gallery offers the perfect opportunity to host the exhibition. The exhibition will kick off in October 2026, carrying through to March 2027. \nCharlotte notes the exhibition\u2019s themes are also of particular relevance to Wellington. \u201cI hope that the exhibition and our return to Te Ng\u0101kau Civic Square will reflect our city and also help remake it. We are looking forward to opening with a bang.\u201d\nHero image: \u00a9 Cornelia Parker. Courtesy of the artist and Frith Street Gallery, London",

    "long_description": "Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",
