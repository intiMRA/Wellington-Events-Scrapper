Picture golden sunsets, flamingos, thatched umbrellas and the carefree buzz of a sun-soaked getaway, right in the heart of Wellington. No passport required.\r\n\r\nThe menu is vibrant and full of escapist flair. Start with coconut prawns and banana blossom kokoda, then dive into mains like mango glazed  pork rib rack or the tropical tofu paneer curry. Save room for dessert: pineapple upside-down pudding or a coconut rum fondue to bring the tropical fantasy to a sweet finale. Behind the bar, the tiki and kava-spiked cocktails flow freely, from Blue Hawaiian\u2019s to retro rum punches, all dressed to impress with flamingo stirrers, umbrellas and tropical garnishes.\r\n\r\nA golden-age soundtrack sets the mood, featuring the smooth calypso of Harry Belafonte, beachy vibes from The Beach Boys, and sun-drenched classics by Astrud Gilberto.\r\n\r\nClub Tropicana is a winter getaway, fun and fabulously over the top.",

From its early beginnings to the Olympic stage, the story of rock climbing in Aotearoa is rich with colourful characters, special places, and contests for belonging.\nNatalie will speak about the early years of rock climbing in Aotearoa, and why a new generation of New Zealand mountaineers in the 1960s turned to rock climbing on crags as a 'safer', yet equally exciting, form of climbing.\nAs always, there will be pizza and chats!

The fall left him a paraplegic along with other complications that resulted in his health slowly deteriorating.\nPrior to his accident Steve painted prolifically at home for years hoping to one day have an exhibition of his works, but sadly never quite realising his goal.\nSteve led a solitary and independent life, the quintessential artist\u2019s life really and often struggled with his mental health. After his death his family have gathered nearly 80 works on canvas from his home in Karori to curate a small exhibition.\nSteve studied as an industrial designer in his early years and started out painting sets for festivals and events. His illustrative landscape paintings of the coastal bays and vistas around his home in Wellington have a naive quality and a playful graphical style along with confident use of colour.\nWe want to honour Steve and give him the exhibition he always dreamed of having.\nHis daughter Emma will be in the gallery from 10am -12pm on Saturday morning and we would love it if you could visit to support Steve\u2019s dedication to his life long art practice.\nPlease share this event with anyone who might like to attend.\nHuge thanks to Artist 24/7 Gallery for hosting us.\nSaturday 9th August / 10am-12pm\n247 Riddiford St\nNewtown, Wellington\n(Note: a private wake in the gallery for family and friends of Steve\u2019s is being held on Friday 8th August from 5-7pm) ",

    "long_description": "Please remember this is a ZERO WASTE and *NO ALCOHOL* community gathering.\nKia ora!\nFull Moon Drumming Wellington is a registered public event with the Wellington City Council. We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Driftwood from nearby south coast beaches is often abundant, feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page. The less cars driving the better.\nFeel free to share the event page and send an event invite to whomever you feel would be interested, not everyone sees the notifications and advertising ",

    "long_description": "What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

    "description": "Facilitated by Curator and Artist Israel Randell who will be joined by ringatoi Aroha Matchitt-Millar, Enjoy Curator Brooke Pou and Kiingi Tuheitia Portraiture Award 2025 winner Jazmin Tainui Mihi Paget-Knebel.\nThis is a w\u0101nanga for rangatahi ringatoi at any stage of their harenga.\nThe intimacy of the process of skinning and pelting manu is both cathartic and repairing, recognizing the role colonisation had in separating M\u0101ori from these taonga while whatu-ing the strands of whakapapa back together.\nHer toi centres the celebration of M\u0101ori and Indigenous cultures through the practice of decolonizing the lens and reclamation of visual narratives from an indigenous perspective.\nThere is an accessible wharepaku at the back of the venue."

    "long_description": "Join us for a masterclass with soprano Lauren Armishaw on Monday 11th August from 3pm-5pm in the Hunter Council Chamber. The focus of the masterclass will be on Baroque repertoire, on which Lauren has built her career as a soloist in based in Europe. Having completed her initial study here at VUW, she then completed her Masters in Early Music at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague, and she says she's excited to return and share her knowledge with the next generation of singers.\nBiography:\nSoprano Lauren Armishaw grew up in Wellington where she studied singing with Emily Mair at Victoria University of Wellington, and completed degrees in both Composition and Mathematics. Alongside music and maths, she took courses in Italian, Psychology, and Biology, and remembers her time at VUW as incredibly fulfilling \u2014 not just for study, but for the wider university life. She was a member of the Italian Club, played Gamalan, and even paddled with the Dragonboat Team.\nAfter moving to the Netherlands in 2002, she completed her Master\u2019s in Early Music at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague, and has since built a career as a versatile soloist performing across Europe \u2014 from major baroque and classical works by Handel, Bach, Mozart and Monteverdi, to contemporary groups like Asko|Sch\u00f6nberg Ensemble.\nShe\u2019s particularly passionate about 17th and 18th-century opera, and for her Master\u2019s final presentation she unearthed and revived a forgotten staged oratorio by F. C. Lanciani from 1690 \u2014 because why not?\nWhilst on regular trips home to NZ, Lauren has given concerts together with NZ Baroque Orchestra, Baroque Voices and Auckland Choral Society.\nHer deep love for choral music began during her years in the NZ Secondary Students Choir, NZ Youth Choir, and World Youth Choir \u2014 experiences she credits with shaping her musical identity. Ensemble singing continues to be a big part of her life: she\u2019s a core member of the Netherlands Bach Society and performs regularly with the Netherlands Chamber Choir.\nLauren is excited to return to VUW to work with the next generation of singers. Whether you want help getting your Handel and Bach recits and arias into shape or want to explore some lesser known baroque repertoire, she\u2019s here to share insight and encouragement.\nFor more info: www.laurenarmishaw.com\n",

    "long_description": "Musical improv can be absolute magic. Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years. She directed One Night Band which won 'Most Original Production' at the Wellington Theatre Awards 2023, and performs regularly as both a player and musician for POPROX.\nISAAC THOMAS has been an improviser and improv musician for a decade in P\u014dneke and Whakat\u016b/Nelson. He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2025. We'll giveaway any spots remaining a few days before the first workshop of the course, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email poproximprov@gmail.com and we'll pop you on the SBL. Everyone on the list will be notified whether there was a place available for them 3 days before the first workshop. ",

Through resonant soundscapes, guided meditation, colour, scent and intentional rest, you\u2019ll be invited to explore the cycles of growth, release, reflection, and renewal within yourself.\nEach session begins with a gentle meditation, followed by a sound journey that mirrors the energetic mood of the moon. These sessions are spacious, meditative, and restorative \u2014 open to anyone seeking connection with body, breath, and the unseen tides that move us. We will finish with silence and tea, to help integrate and ground.\nAll sessions will take place on the four Wednesdays of August, starting at 7pm.\nThe Four Sessions:\n06.08 - 1. Waxing Gibbous in Capricorn \u2013 \"Edge of Fullness\"\nA gong bath for expansion, tension, and the power of almost.\n13.08 - 2. Waning Gibbous in Aries \u2013 \"The Unravelling Light\"\nA sound ritual for release, gratitude, and gentle undoing.\n20.08 - 3.Waning Crescent in Cancer \u2013 \"Return to the Deep\"\nA meditative descent into rest, reflection, and inner shadow.\n27.08 - 4.Waxing Crescent in Libra \u2013 \"Kindling the New\"\nA soft emergence \u2014 a ritual for vision, hope, and gentle beginnings.\n\nWhether you attend one session or the full cycle, each phase offers a way in \u2014 a space to listen more deeply to your inner world, to the moon, and to sound itself.\nWhat to bring: A yoga mat or two, blanket, pillow, and anything that helps you feel comfortable lying down. **I recommend bringing extra cushioning as the floor here is concrete.**\nYou are welcome to bring a journal, crystals, or other ritual items.\nNo prior experience with sound journeys or astrology is necessary \u2014 just come as you are.

Each reading will be followed by a 30 minute chat with the writer, facilitated by the director. It's an exciting and creative way to develop new work, both for writers, who receive feedback at an early stage, and for audiences who get to water the seed from which the fruit will eventually grow.\nWe will also be hosting an industry workshop led by Playmarket, leading a conversation on opportunities, processes and accessibility for new playwrights. Playwrights will need to register for this free workshop which has 20 spaces.\nThe whole event is NZSL interpreted. Accessible to blind/low vision folks without audio description.\nCheck out the program for more details of each play, content notes and pre show information here: https://www.magnificentweirdos.com/fd-program\n#FirstDraft #Playwrights #LiveTheatre #Playreading #NeurodivergentWriters #DeafWriters #DisabledWriters #HannahPlayhouse #Wellington\nINSTAGRAM:\n@hannahplayhouse @sameena.zehra @WgtnCC @playmarketnz ",

    "long_description": "La Bella: 25th Anniversary - Strictly Vinyl edition!\n\nIn 2000, La Belle wasn\u2019t just a party, it was a reckoning. A bold, bass-heavy moment in Wellington\u2019s club history where women behind the decks claimed the space loud and proud. No permission. No compromise. Just raw talent, deep crates, and dance floor alchemy. It was a night where sonic mischief met feminine force, and the booth finally belonged to women who had long been left out of the spotlight.\n\n25 years later, the original trio returns, not to recreate the past, but to honour the legacy and remind us why it mattered.\n\nMiss Robyn, the original host and pulse of the La Belle movement, brings her instinctive, unapologetic selections back to centre stage.\nOdette (aka Gimpgirl), known for her subversive sets and fearless mixing, returns with the same attitude that shook up lazy lineups and demanded more from every beat.\nAmber (aka Bandit), the international wax slinger whose fingerprints still live on half the city's record sleeves, comes home to channel decades of global experience into one unmissable set.\n\nThis is no nostalgia act. This is a vinyl-fuelled rebellion.\n\nAll vinyl. All night.\nFrom classic house to rolling techno and razor-sharp breaks, this is a celebration of the women who carved their place in the booth and never let go.\n\nNo sync buttons. No trend-chasing. No gimmicks.\nJust three women taking the dance floor hostage, one more time.",

Pairing rich vocal harmonies with vibrant original music inspired by the folk and Americana playbooks, this band brings something for everyone.\nHihi & The Stitchbirds are:\nElena Saunders - vocals and vibes\nChris Goldsbury - guitar, clarinet and vocals\nTess Luff - guitar, banjo uke and vocals\nMatt Hutton - bass uke and vocals\nEllie Stewart - fiddle and vocals\nAbout the Bidibids:\nWith lush harmonies, intricate arrangements, and beguiling melodies, the Bidibids explore what it means to play folk music in New Zealand. The Bidibids are Sarah August on banjo and guitar, Simon Carryer on cello-banjo, and Brendan Schenk on mandolin and guitar. The trio came together at the 2020 Wellington Folk Festival, where they were each supposed to be playing in different groups. Since then, the Wellington-based band have become regulars at some of the region\u2019s best venues for folk music, including the Mussel Inn, Moon, and the Wellington Bluegrass Society.\nDriven by Sarah\u2019s honest, intimate songwriting and Brendan\u2019s blazing musicianship, the Bidibids balance soulful ballads that will tug your heart-strings with upbeat numbers which will get your toes tapping. Influenced by American bluegrass and folk bands like Watchhouse and Nickel Creek, they\u2019re also inspired by local acts like the Eastern and Marlon Williams who are forging an authentic New Zealand folk tradition.

Hear artists Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox in a series of conversations with curator Megan Dunn, about how each artists work ask us to consider the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nDenise Batchelor is a visual artist based in Hokianga, in the far north of New Zealand. Batchelor has an MFA (2010) from Whitecliffe College of Arts and Design, Auckland. Working primarily in digital media, both still and moving image, Batchelor\u2019s work reflects personal encounters within nature; quiet moments of reflection within which deeper connections can be experienced. She has exhibited widely in New Zealand for the past fifteen years, and internationally in Sweden, Germany, Italy, USA, Scotland and France. A recipient of artist residencies and art awards, her work is held in public and private collections.\nBrit Bunkley is a New Zealand-based artist and videographer whose practice spans sculpture, installation, and digital media. A recipient of the US National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, two NY state grants, and the Rome Prize Fellowship, his work explores the intersection of physical and virtual spaces, often blending surreal imagery with themes of history, politics, and environmental concerns. He has exhibited at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa and internationally at Rencontres Internationales Paris/Berlin, FILE S\u00e3o Paulo (including 2025), and the Athens Digital Arts Festival. Recent exhibitions include Visions in the Nunnery, London (2022), Cybersculpture 2024 at Coll\u00e8ge des Bernardins, Paris, and The Torrance Art Museum, LA (2025). In 2024, he won Best Art | Experimental Video/Film at the New York City Independent Film Festival. His work continues to evolve, embracing new technologies and alternative methodologies to challenge perceptions of reality and imagination.\nJane Dodd is a contemporary jeweller based in Dunedin. Dodd has a BA from Otago University and a Diploma in 3D design from UNITEC in Auckland. Since the early \u201890s she has exhibited widely in solo and group exhibitions in New Zealand and internationally.\nHer jewellery is largely a carving-based practice utilizing re-purposed woods and bone. Narratives from the environment and animal world, homages to historic crafts, critiques of modern society, mysterious plotlines, comedy and tragedy can all be found in her jewellery.\nJohn Ward Knox is an artist living in Karitane, north of \u014ctepoti (Dunedin). He has a Master of Fine Arts from Elam School of Fine Arts and was the recipient of the National Drawing Award, in 2008, and the Frances Hodgkins Fellowship at Otago University, in 2015. His work has been included in The Archibald Prize, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney (2020) and is included in New Zealand and Australian collections. Ward Knox leans towards materials and objects that are imbued with time and patience and are rewarding to touch. ",

    "long_description": "Whether you\u2019re already retired, or planning ahead, this practical workshop will help you to reflect, re-envision and re-vitalise your life and develop a plan for your future, on your own terms. (NZ citizen and residents free with ID, all others pay $109).\n\nIn your middle years, working, retired or somewhere in between? What\u2019s next? Life is about much more than work or leisure, but most of us have given little thought to what \u201cretirement\u201d might mean.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to speculate what may happen in the future \u2013 but we can be proactive and take control.\nThis course offers insights into how to make the most of our time once we\u2019re less focused on career and/or childrearing. It covers many of the issues people face when considering a move from current employment to a different lifestyle that includes more time to do the things we\u2019ve always promised ourselves we\u2019d do \u2013 \u201cwhen we retire\u201d.\n\nAfter the workshop, you\u2019ll be able to identify a number of common issues and potential ways to manage them when considering and planning your \u201crejuvenation\u201d, rather than a retirement. We won\u2019t cover financial planning, but will focus on some of the personal growth opportunities for living and making a conscious contribution to your community.\n\nBy the end of the day, you\u2019ll have:\n- Developed your own perspective on ageing and retirement in the 21st Century and identified what\u2019s important to you\n- Completed a personal life audit exercise and considered your strengths\n- Explored possibilities in the major aspects of your life and identified potential challenges and strategies for overcoming them\n- Developed a blueprint to maximise the best years of your life and developed a \u201cfuture proofing\u201d downsizing plan\n- Considered options to include a sense of purpose and explored and implemented choices that provide you with that sense of purpose\nBring a pen and paper.\n\n1 day, Sat 9:30 AM \u2013 4:00 PM\nWellington High School\nPresented by Angela Robertson",

An ode to her late Grandfather\u2019s love of the land, the tour generated over $2000 in donations for Forest & Bird.\nJenny grew up in a home and family of music and often tours with her sisters, The Mitchell Twins, and country music loving Dad, Ron Mitchell. After growing up with a musical diet of The Chicks, Hank Williams and Dolly Parton, Jenny penned her first songs at the age of 11 after a trip to Ireland where she connected with her Irish heritage and explored the immigration story of her Irish born Grandparents. A few years down the track, Jenny performed original work on the TV show New Zealand's Got Talent, was placed 3rd and went onto crowdfund and release her first album at the age of 15. In 2017, she was crowned the overall winner of the NZ Gold Guitar Awards which kickstarted the professional chapter of her career, leading to her Aotearoa Music Award Winning album 'Wildfires\u2019 produced by Tasmania\u2019s Matt Fell.\nWith a sound that No Depression describes as, \u201cpoetry that dominates a beautiful melody,\u201d Jenny Mitchell is comfortable with a country twang or softly spoken ballad and is rapidly capturing fans across the globe.\n",

    "long_description": "Life drawing with a difference - it's Life Drawing @ Wellington Naturist Club. The next one is on Sunday 17th Aug 2025.\nWe have the sessions monthly. If the weather is not suitable for outdoor life drawing then we'll be inside, nice and warm.\nThe fee for life drawing is the normal Day Visit Fee of $20, for non-members. (The life drawing is otherwise free for Club members and for non-members who are paying for an overnight stay on the Sat or Sun nights.)\nBring some lunch. Morning and afternoon tea are provided. You can bring your own art materials, or you can use some that are provided. Come to either draw or to model or swap between the two. All the models are volunteers, so a nice variety of shapes and sizes all in the one session. Draw if you like. Model if you like.\nThe session format: beginning the session with 2 minute poses to warm-up, then increasing the pose lengths to something between 10-30 minutes. Each model posing chooses how long their pose(s) will be in that 10-30 minute range.\nSome tuition is given to those who would like it. We'll be life drawing from 11am until 3pm, but you\u2019re very welcome to come and go as you please, and to use the club facilities. It's a pretty casual event.\nThere's full kitchen facilities, BBQ facilities, the new hot tub, spa, sauna, table tennis, golf, eels to feed, bush walks etc. Make a day of it if you like.\nIf you're coming for the life drawing at the club, then the only time anyone is obliged to wear \"club uniform\" is if you're modelling for the life drawing, or you\u2019re using the spa/hot tub/sauna/pool. Otherwise just wear - or don't wear - what you like. No need to book either, just come enjoy the day.\nWellington Naturist Club, 20 Molloys Rd, Te Marua, Upper Hutt 5018. Call the club mobile 027 330 6212 when you get to the gate, so you can be buzzed in. Then follow the signs to park and come up to the hall to see where we will be having the session. ",

Through a blend of philosophical reflection and grounded tools, we\u2019ll explore how to steady the mind and reconnect with deeper purpose in the face of pressure or doubt.\n\n\nMeet your host, Sivananda\nSivananda\u2019s background is in both science and music, holding a Master's Degree in Data Science, a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a long history of playing and performing on the double bass. His passion for philosophy, music, good food and community attracted him to the bhakti lifestyle. Having studied and practiced the science of the \u2018self\u2019 for six years now, he thrives on drawing insights from contemporary science and combining it with yoga wisdom to encourage others to explore new perspectives.\n6.15pm Tuesday 19th August\nEnd the session on a high note with a delicious plant-based dinner, dessert, and good conversation.\nTickets available here~ bit.ly/eventTickets\nBhakti Lounge 1/175 Vivian Street, Te Aro, Wellington. http://www.bhaktilounge.org.nz ",

Anyone can bid on an original and unique piece - from acrylics to watercolours, ceramics and jewelry. Previous auctions have featured contributions from Sheyne Tuffery, Juliet Best, Karl Fritsch, and Nicola Jackson.\nThis year contributors include Greta Menzies, Ewan McDougall and Carrie Carey, to name a few. Friday night's auction is free to attend, but it is an 18+ licensed event.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, the school opens its doors to allow you to wander through the exhibition at your own pace (with a coffee in hand). Art works will be on sale all weekend, so you could pick up a piece or two.\nNot only that, but this year also sees the auction host, Island Bay School, celebrate its 125th anniversary. There'll be an exhibition featuring stories, photos and memories of the school, its tamariki and kaiako.\nThis event is a fundraiser for Island Bay School to help support its amazing Artist in Residence and other art-based programmes. These give the tamariki space in which to experiment, play and create alongside some phenomenal artists. ",

No pressure to speak\u2014just your presence is enough. We follow a respectful, non-judgmental format that prioritizes safety, confidentiality, and authenticity.\nOptional Plant-Based Dinner\nStay afterwards for a nourishing, plant-based dinner and dessert ($15). Sharing a meal is a powerful way to extend the connection beyond the circle. This gathering is not run for profit\u2014Andre is simply passionate about creating spaces for genuine connection.\nWhat to Expect in the Circle:\nGathering in Circle: We sit in a circle to foster a sense of unity and equality.\nCentering In: A short meditation or silence helps us arrive and ground.\nTalking Object: A shared object moves around\u2014only the person holding it speaks.\nOptional Sharing: Speak if you feel moved.

That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. Over the years, Andre has come to value the power of sitting in circle\u2014of men coming together in honesty, vulnerability, and presence to witness and support one another. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\n................................................................................................\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

    "long_description": "Chef Jessica Tang and legendary home chefs Litia Lefaoseu and Iutita Mallon are drawing on the century long fusion of Chinese and Samoan cuisine and the way food expresses love, ai, and alofa. In the late 1800s, small numbers of Chinese settled in Samoa and became part of a growing multicultural community. There they influenced local customs, made an enduring contribution to Samoan cuisine introducing contemporary favourites such as sapasui (chop suey), keke pua\u2018a (pork buns) and of course laisa (rice). \r\n\r\nDragons celebrate this cultural and culinary fusion by showcasing these favourites and presenting new dishes highlighting the shared love of culinary staples such as taro and noodles, rice, fish, and pork, the magnificent spectrum of Chinese herbs, spices and flavours. Through cooking and sharing food together the chefs honour their culinary heritage, strengthen our connections to one another and celebrate the big and little moments in life. This is a shared-style meal, served banquet style on lazy Susan turntables. \r\nDragons is My Uso was one of the sell-out hits of the 2024 festival - don't miss out!\r\n\r\nDiscounted tables for 10 available for $1000, so get the whole aiga together!",

It was a huge success, with over 250 audience members and 52 artists over our four sessions. Audiences were raving about the musical variety and great talent they found at the Racket Lounge, and as one audience member commented; \u201cWell done\u2026do it again!\u201d So, we listened, and the Racket Lounge is back for round two! Once again hosted at Bedlam & Squalor (above the Rogue & Vagabond), we welcome audiences, composers and performers back for another four concerts full of innovative, fun, and chill music. From classical to pop covers, video game soundtracks to original compositions, there's something for everyone to sink their teeth into at The Racket Lounge!\n\nEven if you've never been to a classical music concert before, this one is for you. With a 'Choose your price' model you can afford to give it a go - and you might even find something you like!\n\nA Flexible Price, So You Can Take A Chance on Something New:\nOur prices range from $5 to $100, just pick the ticket price you feel like paying. At The Racket Lounge, we believe everyone should have access to high-quality but affordable art. If you're a bit strapped for cash right now, but still want a good night out, no worries! Just book yourself a $5 ticket! If you can afford to pay a little more and want to do some good for your community, then pick one of our higher ticket prices and rest assured that your dollars are going towards funding great, accessible art in your city.\n\nAll proceeds from ticket sales will go directly into presenting the next Racket Lounge, including paying musicians and artists, hiring instruments and marketing costs. Plus, by choosing a higher price point, you're ensuring that we're able to continue to offer tickets at a lower price point for those who need it.\n\nPlease note: Bedlam & Squalor is a licenced venue, so under 18s must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Everyone must bring ID.",

By integrating creative writing into your painting practice, you can enhance your imagination, storytelling abilities, emotional expression, attention to detail, and personal style on the canvas. Please bring along a journal or laptop.\n\nCOURSE CONTENT\nEach session presents a key idea backed by research or concrete examples, followed by practical writing exercises with optional sharing. We learn by doing and from each other.\n\n1. Generating work from the interior: tapping into memories, conflict, emotion, and observation to generate art.\n2. Figuring out what matters to you, then learning how to grow your fragmented ideas into something whole. For example, how do you turn a feeling, or a fleeting moment in time into a story? Into a painting? Into a work of art? What are the building blocks you need?\n3. Inspiration from other creative sources: people, music, poetry, reading, random incidents. Ways to generate fresh ideas. How to clarify and focus in writing and art.\n4. Structure and boundaries. Dreaming big but being real. How do you find and stick to a creative process? Understanding how you learn and what kind of feedback you need. Designing your next project.\n\nThursday mornings, 9:30 - 11:45 am.\n4 - 25 September.",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods. Her works have appeared in the Politics, International Politics, Political Science, PS: Political Science & Politics, Journal of Contemporary China, Pacific Review, and Asian Security.",

    "long_description": "Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!!

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.",

The Orchestra is a national trailblazer in big band history and features New Zealand compositions, and a classic repertoire from the golden era of big band swing jazz of Ellington and Basie.\n\nThe band benefits from a depth of talent that most military bands around the world would only dream of and is made up of Wellington\u2019s most exceptional musicians.\n\n\u201cThe line-up will be a who\u2019s who of the Wellington jazz scene,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s a while since we had a big band at the festival, so we\u2019re elated to have the Airforce Jazz Orchestra back with us again. They last played at the festival in 2014. Many of the band members have been here since, but not as part of a big band,\u201d says Lee.\n\nBe Transported by April\u2019s Fools\nImagine stepping back in time to a speak easy club. A smoky, dimly lit room where the anticipation is electric but the vibe is laid-back and relaxed. . .\n\nFrom the stage a jazz swing and blues band begins to play, their instruments blending seamlessly in a harmonious symphony of sound. The rhythm section, with its upright bass and snare drums, lays down a groove that's impossible to resist, while the saxophone punctuates the air with soulful notes.\n\nAt. the forefront stands a captivating female singer, her voice rich and velvety, weaving tales of heartache, joy, and everything in between. Her vocal prowess brings both swing and blues to life, effortlessly moving from sultry, slow blues ballads to energetic, foot-tapping swing numbers.\n\nThis band doesn't just play music; they create an experience that transports the audience to another era, where the essence of jazz and blues reigns supreme.\n\nWelcome to an evening of superb swing jazz and blues brought to you by the band that is April\u2019s Fools. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely wrapt to be bringing this ultra-talented and experienced combo to the festival,\u201d says Music Director Lee Quayle. \u201cWhenever, and wherever this group of musicians have played reviewers have to search the thesaurus for new superlatives to describe the show, and audiences leave reluctantly, but happy.\u201d\n\nApril\u2019s Fools are April Phillips (vocals), Greg Crayford (drums), Zak Dikvert (guitar), Nicholas Bauke-Maunsell (saxophone), Miles Crayford (keyboards) and RoryMacartney (bass).

Each of the six laps is slightly over 7km, with around 400m in elevation (2500m in total). Try not to trip on a loose rock while taking in the aromatic smells emanating from the tip.

It\u2019s not even that fun.\nThis is a race for those that want a little more from life than the ordinary. Those that question the monotony of their daytime jobs and wonder, \"isn't there meant to be more to life than this?\" Enter TTM...

(Re-)Imperialism\u2014not just liberalism\u2014remained a central ordering mechanism well after 1945. I show the two-way deep contestations between the liberal and anticolonial ordering projects, especially at the 1955 Bandung Conference. Contra the post-LIO pessimism of disorder/chaos, I argue that the normative agency of the Southeast Asian states informed by the legacy of Bandung is heralding a multiplex, multi-regional world order. As the declining inequality between the West and Asia transforms the core-periphery LIO, the emergent decentered world order will lack a core, whether Western/liberal or Asian. This deep transformation should be welcomed, not deeply contested, although coexistence and global integration require embracing deep pluralism, not liberalism.\nManjeet S.
