This is no ordinary tasting event, it\u2019s a full-blown sensory adventure where brewers go wild, food gets fancy, and the unexpected is always on tap. \r\n\r\nExpect more than 60 breweries pouring over 300 unique brews\u2014from hazy IPAs and fruited sours to beer cocktails and non-alcoholic surprises. \r\n\r\nBut Beervana isn\u2019t just about the beer. It\u2019s a feast for all senses: think whitebait fritters from Boulcott St Bistro, Korean fried chicken, Mahurangi oysters. Add in live music, quirky brewery stands (yes, there\u2019s a Best Stand vote), and unexpected entertainment and you\u2019ve got a festival that you'll come away from with a greater knowledge of great beer, a belly full and plenty of fun memories with your mates.",

    "long_description": "\u2018Animals first entered the imagination as messengers and promises,\u2019 John Berger.\nMessengers explores the enduring gaze shared between humans and other animals. The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

This is an excellent opportunity to treat yourself to some creative fun!\n\nIn weeks one and two you'll learn how to work with jeweller's hard wax to create beautiful textures in metal that can be used to create amazing rings or objects. Your waxes will be sent away for casting in the metal of your choice.\n\nThen there will be a week's break before the third session, to allow time for everyone's waxes to be cast. The third session covers how to trim, clean and finish your casts, turning them into original jewellery ready to wear!\n\nMore advanced students can use these sessions to complete projects in a class setting.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are all your different types of waxes, sandpaper and courier costs.\n\nNot included are the casting and metal costs which vary from student to student depending on what sized ring they want to make and the type of metal you choose. Small castings can cost around $6.65 - $12 and might cost between $7 to $30 in metals depending on if you use red bronze, white bronze or silver.\n\nThis class is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.",

    "long_description": "Wellington\u2019s iconic Old St Paul\u2019s will play host to a transcendent new series in August, partnering with the Pyramid Club to present Altared States, a unique electronic music experience.\nSet beneath the exquisite stained-glass windows of one of Te Whanganui-a-Tara\u2019s most exquisite landmarks, this series promises an immersive sonic experience that invites audiences to explore sound in a deeply personal and transformative way.\nAltared States is inspired by Brian Sweeney\u2019s New York-founded Ambient Church, an initiative dedicated to collaborating with artists to create transformative audio performances in architecturally significant spaces. This series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\nEach of the evenings will bring a different electronic vibe, conjured by some of Wellington\u2019s most innovative artists. The series lineup includes:\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\nTickets are available from Wednesday 18 June, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\nAbout the Artists\nLudus\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\nStephen Gallagher\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\nDavid Long\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\nJules Desmond\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\nOghum\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\nJess Chambers\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration.

    "long_description": "What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

We were also making experimental attempts into the world of radio, with the birth of Mouthfull\u2019s first international streaming server, playing music 24/7 (also live events a few times a week).\nIf we travel even further back in time, 2017 was the debut of the \u201cMouthfull Radio\u201d episodic series (~20eps) - but we consider the ongoingness the real thing to celebrate.\nMoving towards present day ~ through a vast richness of hosts, events, music, shows, zines, selectors, connections, pop ups, and story-times. It is a real joy to help community contemporary radio ripple out from this Pacific Island nation to the world wide web.\n\n5 Years goes so fast, and so we shall honour this time with a great celebration in the capital city of Aotearoa! We will bring together all of the elements of Mouthfull you have known to love; make some books, make up some new dance moves with friends, and make our ears glisten in the sounds of live and selected music.\nWhiro // New Moon. The last dark night of winter. A time for reflection; an invitation to come together as friends and wh\u0101nau and plant intentional seeds for future flowers to bloom, as well as rest in deep listening and shared beingness.\n\nLineup:\n*\u00baJuniper May\n*\u00baStar Time\n*\u00baajhoneysuckle (t\u0101maki)\n*\u00baMystery Waitress (duo)\n*\u00baDJ B.Lo (wh\u0101katu)\n*\u00b0Benny Salvador\n\n\nWe are also releasing our first ever compilation. This special event will be opened with a premiere listening session of the full CD, playing the album all the way through. You can purchase a physical copy at the show, or on bandcamp (preorders open September 1st).\n5PM sharp CD push play. Some divine collaborators with unique new releases on offer.\n\nThis is a fundraiser to support the sustainability of Mouthfull. We are only able to pay the bills due to events like this, and are fundraising to support a long awaited update of our digital infrastructure to enable future support. THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT - you can support us by purchasing a ticket (extra donation if you are balling), a tshirt, a raffle ticket, or a zine - it all goes to the same goal of enabling & uplifting one another.\n",

    "description": "Our track maintenance and planting working bees are focussing on plant species diversity rather than large planting quantities.\nWe have ordered 500 special trees from the Berhampore Nursery.\nWe are in this for the long haul and a forest that contains a wide range of plant species will, in turn, attract a wider range of birds, lizards, and invertebrates.\nA wider range of plant species also allows for the forest to naturally regenerate and helps prevent weed species from establishing.\nTools are provided, bring sturdy shoes and a water bottle, Working bees are held every Sunday in June (except June 1st - Kings Birthday Weekend) and August 2025."

    "long_description": "This Sunday afternoon block is a short course on jewellery-making. It starts on Sun 24 August and runs for 4 weeks until Sun 14 September, 2pm - 5pm.\nBeginners will practice the basic techniques in copper or brass and then move on to working in silver. An excellent first project for beginners in this class is to create a simple textured ring band - but once you have the basics down, it is fun to create earrings, pendants or other simple items. Learning to cut, heat, form and texture metal - to solder using a jeweller's torch and silver solder, and finally to polish your work up to a beautiful finish: these classes are super satisfying.\nThese blocks are also a nice way for existing students or more advanced makers to work on more challenging projects and join friendly classes in our well-equipped warm studio!\nBasic materials are supplied and there are extra materials available to purchase as you need in class.\nThis block is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. NOTE: Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.\nOur booking system asks for full payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time please email us to arrange this\nCourse fee $280, Early bird pricing $252 till 27 July. ",

It is a world that, despite its historical setting, feels unnervingly close to our own.\nWith only ten dynamic performers, this is Henry the Fifth like never before: stripped back, sharp, and driven by the raw intensity of Shakespeare\u2019s text.\nExpect fast-paced storytelling, immersive staging, and a production that puts the audience at the heart of the battle.\nFull show duration: 95 min including a 15 min intermission.\n\u201cThis production epitomises what can be achieved when talent, teamwork, hard work, opportunity and passion combine.\u2019\u201d\nNZ Herald on The Tragedy of Macbeth ",

Menus are created on the spot, and dishes are served to a buzzing, hungry crowd. It\u2019s fast-paced, creative chaos with serious culinary skills on display. Guests get a front-row seat to the action, while supporting a truly game-changing enterprise.\r\n\r\n4 August \u2014 Jessie Gibberd, Loretta\r\nOriginally from rural Waikato, Jessie Gibberd made the move to Wellington to study, but it was the buzz of hospitality that captured her heart. Swapping textbooks for tongs, she left her degree behind to dive headfirst into the kitchen. Now a chef de partie at Loretta, Jessie brings a grounded, fresh perspective to one of the city\u2019s most beloved eateries.\r\n\r\n11 August \u2014 Felipe Molina, El Matador\r\nHailing from Chile, Felipe Molina is a professional chef with over 15 years of experience in kitchens around the world. Having worked in several countries and world-class restaurants, Felipe brings a global sensibility to his craft. With a passion for seafood, meats, and bold, expressive flavours, his cooking is shaped by travel and tradition, blending international influence with creativity on every plate.\r\n\r\n18 August \u2014 Zane Gupwell, Graze\r\nZane Gupwell began his hospitality journey at just 15, washing dishes at a local caf\u00e9 in Mount Eden. From there, he headed to Queenstown, learning from a wide range of chefs and kitchen styles before challenging himself with a move to Wellington. Since then, he\u2019s worked at some of the city\u2019s top restaurants and now brings his thoughtful, evolving style to Graze Wine Bar.\r\n\r\n25 August \u2014 Lulu Temmuyin, Mr Go\u2019s\r\nLulu Temmuyin is a chef who loves pushing boundaries, even when they\u2019re unexpected. Lactose intolerant but obsessed with cheese, and not a fan of lamb but winner of a lamb cooking competition, Lulu is all about surprises. At Mr Go\u2019s, she brings bold, sustainable flavour to the forefront, blending personality with punch in every dish.\r\n\r\nEverybody Eats runs on a pay-what-you-can model, transforming food waste into gourmet meals and bringing the community together over good kai. The Next Gen Cook Off celebrates and champions this mission, proving that rescued food can be next-level delicious.\r\n\r\nThe Next Gen Cook Off is proudly supported by The Gas Hub.",

Being open to these moments enhances our lives and the lives of those around us,' Dixey says.\n'In psychology, these tiny moments that stimulate positive feelings are called glimmers.'\nGold is a chemical element with the symbol Au and atomic number 79.\n'Welcome to Glimmers of Gold.'\nAbout Jo Dixey\nDixey is a Royal School of Needlework trained embroiderer. She teaches small groups a variety of embroidery techniques, works on commissions which have included large altar cloths, university banners and work for the fashion and movie industries, and repairs old embroideries. She holds exhibitions of her embroidered pieces every few years.\nIn 2017, Dixey published her first book Stitch People, which was later re-released as Creative Thread.\nHer work is held in private and public collections in New Zealand and overseas.

    "long_description": "Breathwork: A Gentle Reset\nTake a pause from the noise of daily life.\nThis breathwork journey begins with gentle movement to awaken the body and open the breath. Through slow, mindful stretches, we begin softening tension and grounding into the present.\nYou\u2019ll then be guided through two styles of breathwork \u2014 each offering a unique pathway inward. There\u2019s no pressure or expectation, just the freedom to explore what feels right for you:\nA dynamic, connected breath for those who wish to build energy, move emotion, or break through internal blockages\nA slow, rhythmic breath for those seeking stillness, calm, and deeper grounding\nBoth approaches invite a sense of spaciousness \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally \u2014 while supporting nervous system balance and inner clarity.\nTo gently close the session, we\u2019ll move into a quiet, nurturing meditation to support integration and leave you feeling steady, clear, and connected.\nAfterwards, stay and enjoy a nourishing plant-based dinner and dessert, lovingly prepared to complement the experience \u2014 because healing is also about how we feed and care for ourselves.\nWhy Breathwork?\nBreathwork has helped so many shift from a state of tension and overwhelm into a place of ease, clarity, and resilience \u2014 often after just one session. It\u2019s a simple, powerful practice that reconnects you to your body, your breath, and your inner stillness.\nYou\u2019ll leave feeling more grounded, more present, and more like yourself again.\nMeet Karla, your host\nKarla is a breathwork and trauma-somatic facilitator based in Aotearoa (New Zealand), originally from Malta. With over a decade of experience in Reiki and three years facilitating trauma-informed, science-based breathwork, Karla combines holistic tools, meditation, and conscious breathing to support nervous system regulation and deep emotional healing. Her offerings help release stored trauma, reduce stress and anxiety, and activate oxytocin\u2014the \u201clove hormone\u201d\u2014fostering connection, vitality, and a sense of wholeness.

Based in Tamaki Makaurau, Auckland, he crafts lyrical worlds, with a guitar tuned sideways and a voice that balances gravity with joy.\nCunliffe has supported a number of internationally renowned artists including M. Ward, Grace Cummings, and Reb Fountain, bringing his mix of warmth, wit, and slow-burning intensity to stages near and far.\n-----------------\nAli Whitton is an Aotearoa-born, Yorkshire-raised and now Wellington based singer-songwriter who is stepping into his own as an artist. Ali is an artist who refuses to let go, blending raw storytelling with a sound shaped by decades of experience and dedication to his craft.\nPerforming for years under the name Lost Bird, Ali built a reputation for writing heartfelt, melancholic folk-pop, playing everywhere from Wellington bars to stadium stages \u2014 including opening for Ed Sheeran in Auckland in 2018.\nNow, after years of performing behind an alias, Ali is stepping forward under his own name, embracing his identity as an artist with an invigorated sense of purpose, and tackling his artistry with newfound confidence and clarity.\n-----------------\nVogelmorn Upstairs is not a wheelchair accessible building. There is an accessible bathroom in the space. This is an all ages venue but those under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a designated adult after 8pm.

Fronted by the enigmatic Ruth Carr, her coy persona ignites while bandmates Ryan Beehre and Paul Dodge forge rib-rattling beats around her.\nTheir debut album, The 88, released in 2003, achieved gold status in New Zealand, quickly followed up by the 'I Hate Guns' EP.\nOver the following decade, the trio toured their synths and samplers from Helsinki to Hanoi crafting their own refreshing sound \u2013 storming The Crystal Method's club night in LA, the FabricLive birthday bash in London, and headlining the Hanoi Music Festival in Vietnam. Along with festivals and shows up and down Aotearoa.\nHaving been retired since 2014, we\u2019re excited to announce that Minuit are back onstage for a limited number of reunion shows.\nThese reunion performances will pay tribute to classic tunes from all four albums 'The Boy with the Aubergine Hair', 'Except You', 'Fuji', 'Menace', \u2018Aotearoa\u2019, \u2018I Hate Guns\u2019, \u2018A Room Full of Cute\u2019, 'Last Night You Saw This Band', \u201825 Bucks\u2019 \u2013 everything gets a look in, plus a couple of other surprises.\nThe show will be supported by Western Haikus and JOLA BURNS.\nMinuit has a heart.

Maitreya, the World Teacher, and his group The Masters of Wisdom are here - not as religious teachers - to inspire all people to create a civilisation based on sharing, justice and peace; and for humanity to act to do the work to share and save our world.\n\nHumanity at spiritual crossroads\n\nHumanity is at crossroads. One path into the future leads to increasing social and economic division, environmental destruction, war and planetary peril. The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\n\nMaitreya\u2019s priorities\n\nTo help humanity in its task of global transformation, Maitreya has formulated certain priorities. They cover the essential needs of all people, every woman, man and child: an adequate supply of food\u037e housing for all; healthcare and education as basic universal rights. Other top priorities include the restoration of the environment and the establishment of peace.\n\nThe key to achieving these goals requires a major shift of present mind-set and thinking, structures and systems \u2013 and more equitable sharing of the world\u2019s food and resources. To realise humanity is one global family and the planet is a living being. According to Maitreya: \u201cWithout sharing, there can be no justice; without justice, there can be no peace; without peace, there can be no future.\u201d\n\n~ followed by short Transmission Meditation session ~\n\nShare International New Zealand.

    "description": "The goals we have set for this course are: - to understand the principles of meditation practice - to be able to sit comfortably and still - the ability to follow a basic meditation technique independently - to establish a regular home meditation practice - to be inspired to further develop knowledge and skills in meditation In our daily lives, we increasingly need more focus, inner clarity, and perhaps most of all, inner peace.\nThese qualities are inherent to us, though sometimes hidden by a busy mind.\nThis course will provide both theoretical and practical methods to reconnect with your Self.\nSuitable for complete beginners, those returning to their practice after a break, or anyone seeking the support of the Sangha.\nIf you would like to attend the course online please email us at: kapiti@yogaindailylife.org.nz for the Zoom link."

    "long_description": "Musical improv can be absolute magic. Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years. She directed One Night Band which won 'Most Original Production' at the Wellington Theatre Awards 2023, and performs regularly as both a player and musician for POPROX.\nISAAC THOMAS has been an improviser and improv musician for a decade in P\u014dneke and Whakat\u016b/Nelson. He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2025. We'll giveaway any spots remaining a few days before the first workshop of the course, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email poproximprov@gmail.com and we'll pop you on the SBL. Everyone on the list will be notified whether there was a place available for them 3 days before the first workshop. ",

    "description": "More people are using AI, without understanding how it works, without telling their employers that they are using it, without considering the implications, and without knowing how to get the most from the tools they\u2019re using.\nThis is where AI literacy becomes essential - it\u2019s not just knowing how to use AI tools, it\u2019s about understanding what\u2019s possible, and knowing you don\u2019t need to be technically savvy to use it well.\nThis practical two-hour in-person workshop is for real people in real businesses; who want to use AI to do more with the resources and tools they already have.\nNo tech jargon.\nI\u2019ve spent my career helping teams work smarter, minimise risks and leverage opportunities that come from doing business in our fast-changing world."

    "long_description": "Chef Jessica Tang and legendary home chefs Litia Lefaoseu and Iutita Mallon are drawing on the century long fusion of Chinese and Samoan cuisine and the way food expresses love, ai, and alofa. In the late 1800s, small numbers of Chinese settled in Samoa and became part of a growing multicultural community. There they influenced local customs, made an enduring contribution to Samoan cuisine introducing contemporary favourites such as sapasui (chop suey), keke pua\u2018a (pork buns) and of course laisa (rice). \r\n\r\nDragons celebrate this cultural and culinary fusion by showcasing these favourites and presenting new dishes highlighting the shared love of culinary staples such as taro and noodles, rice, fish, and pork, the magnificent spectrum of Chinese herbs, spices and flavours. Through cooking and sharing food together the chefs honour their culinary heritage, strengthen our connections to one another and celebrate the big and little moments in life. This is a shared-style meal, served banquet style on lazy Susan turntables. \r\nDragons is My Uso was one of the sell-out hits of the 2024 festival - don't miss out!\r\n\r\nDiscounted tables for 10 available for $1000, so get the whole aiga together!",

    "long_description": "I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

What if swamp rock wasn't born in Louisiana, but in Takaka you ask? What if Iggy Pop and the Stooges had been Marlborough dairy farmers? What if Hendrix had settled in a Tukurua art gallery selling homemade jewellery crafted from shells and bone? The answer to all these questions and more can be found at a Cowpokers gig: a raw, barn-storming, rural-rock-and-roll sensation that 23 years of gigging has utterly failed to hone, polish, or refine.\n\nTYSON SMITH: Wellington-based guitarist/singer/songwriter Tyson Smith will be bringing his unique, original music combining elements of rock, blues, folk, world music and freeform improvisation.\n\nTyson has worked as a guitarist with acts ranging from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to vocalist Hollie Smith, before focusing on his own music in the last few years.\nIn 2024 he celebrated 10 years since the release of his album The Hollow Tree with Rick Cranson and Ed Zuccollo, and released his new single Wolves. Tyson has been performing regularly around various New Zealand venues and festivals with his raw and exciting sound both with the trio and solo (utilising multiple amps and a bass drum).",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene and GIB.\nCPD points: 10\nTIMING:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLECTURE DATES:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

A large part of the book is devoted to Southeast Asia\u2019s responses to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At the end of the talk Dr Storey will also provide an update of Russia-Southeast Asia relations in 2025 and how the region views the on-going Russia-Ukraine War.\nDr Ian Storey is a Senior Fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Singapore.

It was a huge success, with over 250 audience members and 52 artists over our four sessions. Audiences were raving about the musical variety and great talent they found at the Racket Lounge, and as one audience member commented; \u201cWell done\u2026do it again!\u201d So, we listened, and the Racket Lounge is back for round two! Once again hosted at Bedlam & Squalor (above the Rogue & Vagabond), we welcome audiences, composers and performers back for another four concerts full of innovative, fun, and chill music. From classical to pop covers, video game soundtracks to original compositions, there's something for everyone to sink their teeth into at The Racket Lounge!\n\nEven if you've never been to a classical music concert before, this one is for you. With a 'Choose your price' model you can afford to give it a go - and you might even find something you like!\n\nA Flexible Price, So You Can Take A Chance on Something New:\nOur prices range from $5 to $100, just pick the ticket price you feel like paying. At The Racket Lounge, we believe everyone should have access to high-quality but affordable art. If you're a bit strapped for cash right now, but still want a good night out, no worries! Just book yourself a $5 ticket! If you can afford to pay a little more and want to do some good for your community, then pick one of our higher ticket prices and rest assured that your dollars are going towards funding great, accessible art in your city.\n\nAll proceeds from ticket sales will go directly into presenting the next Racket Lounge, including paying musicians and artists, hiring instruments and marketing costs. Plus, by choosing a higher price point, you're ensuring that we're able to continue to offer tickets at a lower price point for those who need it.\n\nPlease note: Bedlam & Squalor is a licenced venue, so under 18s must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Everyone must bring ID.",

By integrating creative writing into your painting practice, you can enhance your imagination, storytelling abilities, emotional expression, attention to detail, and personal style on the canvas. Please bring along a journal or laptop.\n\nCOURSE CONTENT\nEach session presents a key idea backed by research or concrete examples, followed by practical writing exercises with optional sharing. We learn by doing and from each other.\n\n1. Generating work from the interior: tapping into memories, conflict, emotion, and observation to generate art.\n2. Figuring out what matters to you, then learning how to grow your fragmented ideas into something whole. For example, how do you turn a feeling, or a fleeting moment in time into a story? Into a painting? Into a work of art? What are the building blocks you need?\n3. Inspiration from other creative sources: people, music, poetry, reading, random incidents. Ways to generate fresh ideas. How to clarify and focus in writing and art.\n4. Structure and boundaries. Dreaming big but being real. How do you find and stick to a creative process? Understanding how you learn and what kind of feedback you need. Designing your next project.\n\nThursday mornings, 9:30 - 11:45 am.\n4 - 25 September.",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

    "long_description": "Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!! This booking is for FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER\n                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cWithin the DNA is written not only our histories as individuals but the whole history of the human race \u2026 patterns of DNA that have come down to us virtually unchanged from our distant ancestors \u2013 ancestors who are no longer just an abstract entity but real people who lived in conditions very different from those we enjoy today, who survived them and brought up their children.\u201d ~ Bryan Sykes (The Seven Daughters of Eve)\nReturn to MAIN EXHIBITION WEBSITE - link coming soon",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.",

The Orchestra is a national trailblazer in big band history and features New Zealand compositions, and a classic repertoire from the golden era of big band swing jazz of Ellington and Basie.\n\nThe band benefits from a depth of talent that most military bands around the world would only dream of and is made up of Wellington\u2019s most exceptional musicians.\n\n\u201cThe line-up will be a who\u2019s who of the Wellington jazz scene,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s a while since we had a big band at the festival, so we\u2019re elated to have the Airforce Jazz Orchestra back with us again. They last played at the festival in 2014. Many of the band members have been here since, but not as part of a big band,\u201d says Lee.\n\nBe Transported by April\u2019s Fools\nImagine stepping back in time to a speak easy club. A smoky, dimly lit room where the anticipation is electric but the vibe is laid-back and relaxed. . .\n\nFrom the stage a jazz swing and blues band begins to play, their instruments blending seamlessly in a harmonious symphony of sound. The rhythm section, with its upright bass and snare drums, lays down a groove that's impossible to resist, while the saxophone punctuates the air with soulful notes.\n\nAt. the forefront stands a captivating female singer, her voice rich and velvety, weaving tales of heartache, joy, and everything in between. Her vocal prowess brings both swing and blues to life, effortlessly moving from sultry, slow blues ballads to energetic, foot-tapping swing numbers.\n\nThis band doesn't just play music; they create an experience that transports the audience to another era, where the essence of jazz and blues reigns supreme.\n\nWelcome to an evening of superb swing jazz and blues brought to you by the band that is April\u2019s Fools. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely wrapt to be bringing this ultra-talented and experienced combo to the festival,\u201d says Music Director Lee Quayle. \u201cWhenever, and wherever this group of musicians have played reviewers have to search the thesaurus for new superlatives to describe the show, and audiences leave reluctantly, but happy.\u201d\n\nApril\u2019s Fools are April Phillips (vocals), Greg Crayford (drums), Zak Dikvert (guitar), Nicholas Bauke-Maunsell (saxophone), Miles Crayford (keyboards) and RoryMacartney (bass). They will be playing at Jazz in Martinborough on Friday 5 September 2025 as the opening of the ticketed festival gigs to be held in the Town Hall.",

COKI\nFriday 5th September\nSecret Central Wellington Location (TO BE REVEALED ON EVENT DAY)\nPowered by Banshee Soundsystem\n8pm-2am\nR18\nStrictly limited capacity\nGet ready Welly, because this one is about to be serious. We have secured the one and only COKI for an intimate warehouse rave at an inner city location.\nThis legend of bass needs no introduction, but we\u2019ll give him one anyway. As one half of DIGITAL MYSTIKZ, Coki has made sine waves move like no other, architecting much of the sonic blueprint that modern dubstep has become known for. Alongside Mala, he helped forge the DMZ sound and is now making his way to Wellington for a rare showcase of pure low-frequency warfare. Expect heavyweight pressure, bone-rattling subs, and that unmistakable Coki wobble - this is dubstep in its rawest form.\nOn support we have drawn for the best of the best. Opening up proceedings we have BABETECH, champion selector and vibe master. Since murking opening slots for Loefah, Filth and Kahn &amp; Neek as well as spreading the gospel of bass for countless evenings on RadioActive, we can\u2019t think of a better opener for this night.\nFollowing that, we have dubstep extraordinaire DUSTY warming things up with his signature and gruelling take on the classic dubstep sound. With releases on Infernal Sounds and Leather Kennel, Dusty has proven himself to be a force to be reckoned with, and is surely one of the most exciting young producers in the game today.\nOn closing duties we have the Support Your Local crew going b2b with Young Gho$t to round out the night with a bit of silliness.\nWe\u2019ve managed to secure an all-new inner city warehouse location for this one, and its Further Sound on soundsystem duties this time, heating things up with their BANSHEE SOUNDSYSTEM, preparing for only its second full rollout after Cuba Dupa this year.\nWe\u2019re unbelievably excited to share this space with you all for a dance and are expecting this to be one for the books.Secure your tickets now and don\u2019t miss out on this momentous and legendary dance music event!\nTickets: https://events.humanitix.com/coki-uk-warehouse-rave ",

Each of the six laps is slightly over 7km, with around 400m in elevation (2500m in total). Try not to trip on a loose rock while taking in the aromatic smells emanating from the tip.

It\u2019s not even that fun.\nThis is a race for those that want a little more from life than the ordinary. Those that question the monotony of their daytime jobs and wonder, \"isn't there meant to be more to life than this?\" Enter TTM... I mean, you won't find any answers here but those are the people that tend to be attracted to it.\nDONATIONS:\nAll entry fees charged go to our charities for 2025:\nYouthline Wellington\nSocial Supermarket\nThere is a recommended donation amount for each race of $40 (TTM) or $25 (Half).

    "long_description": "Financially successful people don\u2019t achieve their wealth by accident \u2013 they make and execute clear plans. Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".\n\n1 Day\nPresented by Paul and Mary-Ellen Gadd.",

No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz\n\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing.

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene.\nTiming:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLecture dates:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

    "long_description": "I offer an alternative macrohistory of the Liberal International Order (LIO) that was explicitly designed to perpetuate Western dominance and American hegemony. The LIO is better understood as a core-periphery order because inequality between the Western-core and the \u2018Restern\u2019-periphery was constitutive of it. (Re-)Imperialism\u2014not just liberalism\u2014remained a central ordering mechanism well after 1945. I show the two-way deep contestations between the liberal and anticolonial ordering projects, especially at the 1955 Bandung Conference. Contra the post-LIO pessimism of disorder/chaos, I argue that the normative agency of the Southeast Asian states informed by the legacy of Bandung is heralding a multiplex, multi-regional world order. As the declining inequality between the West and Asia transforms the core-periphery LIO, the emergent decentered world order will lack a core, whether Western/liberal or Asian. This deep transformation should be welcomed, not deeply contested, although coexistence and global integration require embracing deep pluralism, not liberalism.\nManjeet S. Pardesi is Associate Professor of International Relations in the Political Science and International Relations Programme, and Asia Research Fellow at the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. His research interests include World Orders and World/Global History, Great Power Politics, Asian security, and the Sino-Indian rivalry. His most recent book, Divergent Worlds: What the Ancient Mediterranean and Indian Ocean Can Tell Us About the Future of International Order (co-authored with Amitav Acharya) was published by Yale University Press in 2025.",

In this brand new staging by director Anapela Polataivao (Red White and Brass, Wild Dogs Under My Skirt), this story will be told as never before.\n\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he metes out his punishment in the cruellest way possible: by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth, to be fed to the terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze: the Minotaur. As King Minos triumphs, his great monster \u201cwill eat your future, it will rip your hope, it will stamp your youth, your children in the sand.\u201d\n\nAs the vindictive king will soon learn, however, these youth will not accept their fate without a fierce challenge. The Monster in the Maze is a story about resistance; about justice; about finding power not in oppression, but in collectivism. Fittingly, then, it\u2019s also a groundbreaking work in its form: a community-focused and community-driven opera in which young and community singers and players stand proudly shoulder-to-shoulder with their professional counterparts, and in which both are integral.\n\nThe Monster in the Maze has been roundly praised by audiences, participants and reviewers worldwide, and in its Aotearoa debut season, it will serve as a gorgeous articulation of New Zealand Opera\u2019s reciprocal community kaupapa.\n\nSung in English with surtitles.",

When we connect to our inner foundations, we touch the support of those who came before and deepen our sense of belonging to life itself.\nWe\u2019ll begin with ceremonial cacao, then drop into a guided movement journey with live soundscape. There are no steps to learn, no performance\u2014just presence, curiosity, and letting your body move as it feels. Barefoot and phone-free, you\u2019re invited to drop deep into free-form movement, awakening parts of you that you may have forgotten.\nCome as you are.\nMove with what you feel.\nLeave feeling empowered, connected, and alive.\nSomatic dance is a guided movement practice that helps you tune into your body\u2019s wisdom and move from the inside out. Unlike ecstatic dance, which is typically an open, DJ-led space with no facilitation, somatic dance offers gentle guidance to support you in exploring sensation, emotion, and embodiment in a safe, intentional way. You\u2019re not learning steps or performing\u2014you're being invited into presence, curiosity, and feeling. With a focus on nervous system regulation, personal expression, and inner listening, somatic dance creates a nurturing space to come home to yourself.\nYour Hosts...\nJenna Joan | Embodiment Facilitator\nJenna Joan is a somatic therapist, yoga teacher, and group facilitator who has been leading movement spaces for over 15 years. With a background in yoga, somatic dance, and therapeutic embodiment, her work blends play, authenticity, and deep nervous system awareness. Jenna is also a cacao alchemist and ceremonial facilitator, known for creating safe, soulful spaces that invite freedom, connection, and inner exploration. She has been hosting workshops, retreats, and community events for nearly a decade, and also works 1:1 in more therapeutic settings.\nSonic Sutra | Somatic Dance DJ\nSonic Sutra is a sound artist and somatic dance DJ who creates immersive musical journeys designed to support authentic movement, emotional release, and deep embodiment. With a focus on somatic dance and therapeutic soundscapes, their sets are intentionally curated to guide dancers through an inner experience\u2014honouring the body\u2019s natural rhythms and the intelligence within. Their offerings create safe, accessible spaces for people of all bodies, backgrounds, and experience levels to explore movement, presence, and connection. Rooted in play, precision, and deep listening, Sonic Sutra brings music that moves beyond entertainment\u2014into healing and transformation.",

There will be a lot of people for these buses, so please be patient. The bus transfer is free.\nHere you can pick your own daffodils for $5 (Cash Preferred) that is a fundraiser for Wellington Free Ambulance and Wh\u0101nau \u0100whina Plunket, Wairarapa region.

    "long_description": "Join us for our special Fiscal Policy for the Future seminar\nNew Zealand faces significant long-term fiscal challenges, including the rising costs associated with an ageing population, increasing demand for public services, and the need to adapt to a changing global economy. These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand. The Trust was established to support leading tax policy thinking in New Zealand. You can read about the Trust\u2019s work here.\nAbout the presenter\nMichael (Mick) Keen is a former Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, where for over twenty years he played a central role in shaping and delivering IMF policies and advice on tax matters.\nHe has advised finance ministries in all parts of the world, including missions to over forty countries, and led the preparation of influential papers for the G20 and the Executive Board of the IMF.\nBefore joining the Fund, Mick was Professor of Economics at the universities of Essex (UK), Queens (Canada) and Kyoto, and is now Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo.\nMick was the keynote speaker at the 2014 conference on the Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand and has provided peer review for Inland Revenue\u2019s previous Long-Term Insights Briefing.\nMick has jointly authored, with Joel Slemrod, Rebellion, Rascals and Revenue \u2013 an entertaining account of how history illuminates the perennial challenges and timeless principles of taxation\u2014and how the past holds clues to solving the tax problems of today.\nAbout this seminar series\nNew ideas, innovative concepts, research evidence and expert advice are all crucial to stimulate and inform the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis and advice. Our current theme for guest lectures - Fiscal Policy for the Future - explores the role of stabilising, sustainable and effective fiscal policy. Speakers provide insights into how fiscal policy can be designed to support government to meet its current and future objectives and obligations while adapting to changing circumstances and delivering value to the New Zealand public.\nFiscal policy has a stabilising role in helping to smooth the business cycle, while sustainability in fiscal policy is foundational for resilience to both shocks and longstanding challenges, such as climate change, technological advancements, and demographic trends. Ensuring effective and value for money expenditure is important so that fiscal policy contributes to the living standards of New Zealanders, both now and in the future.\nPlease note that the views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series are those of the individual presenters. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the New Zealand Treasury or the New Zealand Government.\nFor updates and our latest research visit: www.treasury.govt.nz\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to be the first to hear about our upcoming events in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series, please SUBSCRIBE to stay up to date.",

    "long_description": "Created and performed by Jackson Burling.\n\n\"NEVER become a truck driver!\" - A young Jackson Burling took that advice, avoiding the fork in the road, but now, after a long and gruelling two year slog in the arts industry he must confront that age old question: \"why not, Dad?\" - and take us along for the ride. In Over and Out, premiering at the 2025 TAHI Festival, Burling brings a real interview, a big character, and even bigger questions to the stage.\n\nOne actor. 50 minutes. Countless emotional potholes. Along the way, we get a rare look into the gritty, heartfelt, and often-overlooked life of one of Aotearoa\u2019s essential workers: the truck driver. Is the open road calling \u2014 or is the stage his true destination? Buckle up. This is verbatim theatre with serious mileage.\n\nAudience Care: Contains coarse language and mature themes.",

The book will be launched by Harry Ricketts.\n\n- Thursday 18 September, 6pm\n- Unity Books Wellington\n- Free event \u2013 all welcome!\n\nJoseph Kinsey is not a name many of us know \u2013 or not as well as we know the name Robert Falcon Scott. But from his base in Christchurch, Kinsey \u2013 book and art collector, philanthropist, science enthusiast, businessman \u2013 forged deep connections with the Antarctic expeditions and the explorers themselves through his tireless work as the agent for various expeditions. Two other New Zealanders also formed close friendships: Charles Bowen, a former politician, and Wellington lawyer Leonard Tripp, to whom Shackleton declared: \u2018I love you as David and Jonathan loved.\u2019\n\nSouth by South tells the story of New Zealand\u2019s role in \u2018the Heroic Age\u2019, that wave of exploration beginning at the end of the nineteenth century in which men set out to traverse the continent of Antarctica and, if they survived, to bring home their findings. The members of this New Zealander triumvirate were all believers in the British Empire, but the southern voyages were to an uninhabited land.\n\nSouth by South brings to light many letters, newspaper articles, and pieces of official correspondence, much of which has not been published before, during the five expeditions of 1901\u20131916: the Discovery, Nimrod, Terra Nova, Aurora, and Endurance. In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship. What they and the explorers wrote was influenced by nineteenth-century adventure stories which conveyed the Imperialist ideals of the time. If the impending conflict of 1914\u201318 was a very \u2018literary war\u2019, this was a very literary exploration.\n\nCharles Ferrall is an associate professor at Te Herenga Waka\u2013Victoria University of Wellington. Among his books are Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics (2001); The Trials of Eric Mareo (2002), co-written with Rebecca Ellis; East by South: China in the Australasian Imagination (2006), co-edited with Paul Millar and Keren Smith; Juvenile Literature and British Society 1850\u20131950 (2009), co-written with Anna Jackson; Henry Lawson in New Zealand (2012); How We Remember: New Zealanders and the First World War (2014), co-edited with Harry Ricketts; and Remembering Gallipoli: Interviews with New Zealand Gallipoli Veterans (2015), co-edited with Christopher Pugsley.\n\nCover photograph: The ship Discovery leaving Lyttelton Harbour, 1901.

Through slow, mindful stretches, we begin softening tension and grounding into the present.\n\nYou\u2019ll then be guided through two styles of breathwork \u2014 each offering a unique pathway inward. There\u2019s no pressure or expectation, just the freedom to explore what feels right for you:\n\nA dynamic, connected breath for those who wish to build energy, move emotion, or break through internal blockages\n\nA slow, rhythmic breath for those seeking stillness, calm, and deeper grounding\n\nBoth approaches invite a sense of spaciousness \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally \u2014 while supporting nervous system balance and inner clarity.\n\nTo gently close the session, we\u2019ll move into a quiet, nurturing meditation to support integration and leave you feeling steady, clear, and connected.\n\nAfterwards, stay and enjoy a nourishing plant-based dinner and dessert, lovingly prepared to complement the experience \u2014 because healing is also about how we feed and care for ourselves.\n\nWhy Breathwork?\n\nBreathwork has helped so many shift from a state of tension and overwhelm into a place of ease, clarity, and resilience \u2014 often after just one session. It\u2019s a simple, powerful practice that reconnects you to your body, your breath, and your inner stillness.\n\nYou\u2019ll leave feeling more grounded, more present, and more like yourself again.\n\nMeet Karla, your host\nKarla is a breathwork and trauma-somatic facilitator based in Aotearoa (New Zealand), originally from Malta. With over a decade of experience in Reiki and three years facilitating trauma-informed, science-based breathwork, Karla combines holistic tools, meditation, and conscious breathing to support nervous system regulation and deep emotional healing. Her offerings help release stored trauma, reduce stress and anxiety, and activate oxytocin\u2014the \u201clove hormone\u201d\u2014fostering connection, vitality, and a sense of wholeness. She currently holds regular classes, workshops, and transformative retreats that nurture the mind, body, and spirit.",

In 2023 Louisa won the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award for her piece Dream Within A Dream, and in 2024 Louisa received a composition commission from the Wellington Jazz Festival and headlined the festival with the new work, The Chasm Where We Fall Into Each Other.  Louisa has worked with L.A.B, Bret McKenzie, AJA, The Rodger Fox Big Band, Royal NZ Air Force Band, Trinity Roots and Lord Echo.\n\"This commission opportunity has come at a perfect time for me to process some recent grief and pain that\u2019s inhabited my circles. Whilst composing this music, I\u2019ve thought about ideas around mental health, specifically with youth in Aotearoa, and also honouring some friends who have passed. I think artists have the ability to turn heartbreak into beauty, and this music is an attempt at that. Although the inspiration which generated the music is heavy, the performance itself will hopefully feel light and reflective (turning heartbreak into beauty = darkness into light!), and will embrace and celebrate the talents of the musicians who are playing. I\u2019ve brought together a beautiful group of people who I know will handle this music with care and fortitude\"\nBryn van Vliet - alto/flute\nTyaan Singh - alto sax\nLouisa Williamson - tenor/flute\nEilish Wilson - baritone sax\nSylvester Green - trumpet\nKaia Johnstone - trumpet\nKaito Walley - trombone\nJakob Elijas - trombone\nAnna Lee - euphonium\nSam Zhu - tuba\nLeonardo Coghini - piano\nJacob Hurst - bass\nMax Sheehan - drums\nThe Jazz Orchestra Composer Series showcases original music for large jazz ensemble by New Zealand composers. Concerts take place every 1st and 3rd Friday of the month, from May to October, from 7pm. Tickets are $15, door sales $20.\nThanks to Creative New Zealand for their generous support.",

For Wayne, his family and his work were his life. They were the source of his life's pleasure and purpose and now he is having to cope with the loss of both.\n\nThe only thing left to take his mind off the pain is cycling with his MAMIL friends, especially Bryan, the central character of MAMIL.

It brings the sewing community together to share stashes, stories and delight in our mutual love of textiles.\nFabric-a-brac is volunteer-run, and is a fundraiser for hospice - in Wellington this is Mary Potter Hospice. All profits from this event are donated to their work. We've raised $80,000 since our first event in 2009.\nSelling fabric\nIf you have a stash you'd like to sell, you can come and take a stall. You pay a stallholder fee (which goes to Hospice) but anything you make on the day is yours to keep. Stalls are allocated via a ballot, which will take place closer to the time. Go to our website to find the form. Closes mid August.\n\nIf you have fabric, haberdashery or patterns you'd like to move on, but don't want to have a table, you can donate items. This will all go onto the hospice table on the day, and all profits will go to their wonderful work.\nFabric donation points\n- Made Marion\n- Mary Potter Hospice - you can take donations to the Mary Potter Hospice in Mein St, Newtown\n\nPop-up cafe\nThe fabulous cafe is back with all of its gorgeous volunteers and fab food. There will be tea, coffee and sweet treats for sale, so you can sit down and chat over your new projects and fabric purchases. All proceeds from the cafe also go to Hospice.\nBuying fabric\nBring cash - most stallholders and the cafe will be selling by cash only.\nWe look forward to seeing our fabulous fabric and sewing community soon!\n*Saturday September 20 2025\n*St Anne's Parish Hall, Emmett Street, Newtown, Wellington",

He\u2019ll be performing with international supergroup, lvdf. The Rodger Fox Big Band returns with a tribute to Ray Charles, and the Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra has its inaugural performance with a Duke Ellington arrangement of Tchaikovsky\u2019s The Nutcracker Suite.

    "long_description": "Growing attention to staff wellbeing has resulted in many workplace mental wellbeing initiatives. Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops.

Insights that very few others trainers or training programs in this country provide. He has had an interest on the impact of social exclusion, alienation and discrimination on mens's wellbeing and advocates for a human rights based, systems change and person-centred approach to wellbeing.The workshop is enriched by the learnings from Barry's own lived experience of depression and suicidality and his pathway to recovery.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to effectively respond to the unacceptably high rate of male suicide in this country.\n\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa. This annual public lecture series recognises the legacy of the late Dr Michael Volkerling who was one of the principal architects of New Zealand's cultural and creative sectors.",
