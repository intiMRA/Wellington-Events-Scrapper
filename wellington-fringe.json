Mixing original text and texting, quotes and online questioning, the young people struggle with contemporary versions of age old problems - love, family, loneliness and belonging, to find their way forward.\nMeeting first on 'Whats the Point .com' they agree to 'end it all.\" But really, Antigone and Hamlet want to spite their uncles, Masha (the Seagull) wants sympathy for her humiliating love triangle, Irena (Three Sisters) wants to get out of Foxton and Hedda (Hedda Gabler) wants to control them all, while Helena (A Midsummer Nights Dream) is very keen to meet Hamlet - \" He sounds pretty much a mess. I'll just wash my hair..\"\nAn award winning play by Micky Delahunty returning to the Fringe eighteen years after its first performance in the same spot and performances in schools and theatres round the country.\nSo if you love the classics AND/OR are young OR know some young people OR were ever young yourself!? - you will find this comedy celebrating the power of human connection as funny and relevant as ever.\n \n \n\n",

Dave lives a perfectly normal life--so normal, in fact, that every moment is dictated by The Narrator. Day after day, he trudges through his monotonous 9-5, until one morning he decides to flip the script.\nWhat follows is a chaotic and playful journey to independence, as Dave wrestles for control of his own story. Along the way, his co-workers--appliances, office supplies, and unexpected allies--spring to life. Some help him, some hinder him, but all push him closer to discovering what it really means to take charge of his own destiny.\nBlending voiceover, puppetry, and live performance, A Man Named Dave is a witty and imaginative exploration of self-determination in an absurd world.\n\n",

Fringe 2015's Best Newcomer finally hatches a new show - a love letter to Wellington and manu we share the city with.\nThis live presentation combines facts, jokes, video, prizes and songs into an engaging slice of science storytelling. Bird numbers are way up all over the city - it's a great time to be a bird or bird fan. Learn about the wildlife swooping past you and get excited for a Wellington that becomes wilder every day.\nFree Fact - most k\u0101k\u0101 are left-footed.\nDavid's last Fringe outing was Towards a Better Understanding of the Universe. Theatreview said, \"This is an autobiographical journey told through the Universe. Yes, the goddam amazing universe that we're all a part of. I'm hooked.\" The show also popped over to Melbourne Fringe where reviews glowed it was \"almost as perfect an hour as you could have.\"\nTowards evolved into Tour de Science - a science storytelling show. The Tour was on a bike and pedalled all around Aotearoa (down to Rakiura and up to Kaitaia!). Across 60 towns and cities, audiences loved David's easy-going yarns that sneakily piled on some real education.\nMost recently, David branched out and became Plant Man: a show for children that wondered, \"What would it be like to be a plant?\" Kim Hill asked him about trees and vegetables and described him as \"cool as a cucumber.\"\nBe cool, get hooked and squawk about this new show. The title says it all - David Klein presents: Birds\n\n",

That meant a year in the chorus line appearing topless before an audience 1,600 onlookers six nights of the week, 52 weeks of the year. \n \nArmed with the lessons of the dressing room - how to apply full body make up, get false eyelashes into place, and of course master the art of wearing a G-string - further adventures took her to the Cannes Film Festival as a rookie reporter. Brushing shoulders with fame at interviews and celebrity parties meant contacts with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Catherine de Neuve and Christopher Reeves. \n \nOnce back in New Zealand in the late eighties, adventuring took a very different form.

A self-proclaimed seeker of truth, he sees himself as a figure like Louis Theroux or David Farrier, when in reality, he is more akin to Alan Partridge and Sean Plunkett.\nUndoubtedly, Beaver's grand return will be met with none of the enthusiasm he expects, and the podcast landscape contains far stranger people than he could possibly imagine. From Prank calls, infuriating elders, conspiracy nut jobs, and an unusual autobiography reveal this return to the 'journalistic stage', may not be as grand as he hoped. \n \n \n\n",

Comprised of pianist James 'Muss' Illingworth, drummer Darren 'D' Mathiassen, and bassist Johnny 'JLaw' Lawrence, this trio has forged a unique sound that defies categorization. Soundscapes oscillate between heavy jazz and thumping hip-hop beats, soaring to emotionally powerful improvisations and dissolving into moments of sublime euphoria.\nTheir compositions are a testament to their collective creativity, weaving together intricate polyrhythms, hypnotic melodies, and explosive improvisations that conjure the raw energy of a live performance. Illingworth's piano playing is a masterclass in dynamic range, shifting seamlessly from delicate nuance to thunderous crescendo, often augmented by his deft use of synthesizers and electronic textures. Mathiassen's drumming is a force of nature, his polyrhythmic wizardry propelling the music forward with unstoppable momentum, while Lawrence's bass lines provide the foundation, his earth-shaking tones anchoring the trio's sonic explorations.\nThe trio's connection is palpable, their synergy born of years of collaboration and experimentation. They've worked with some of the biggest names in music, from Shapeshifter to Bliss n Eso to Louis Baker to Allen Stone, and their experience has honed their craft, allowing them to push the boundaries of jazz and beyond.\nWhen D, Muss & JLaw takes the stage, the energy is electric. Their performances are a testament to their deep connection, their music a living, breathing entity that evolves and adapts in the moment. They're not just playing notes - they're conjuring emotions, telling stories, and transporting their audience to a realm of sonic wonder. This is their Third Chapter.\n\n",
