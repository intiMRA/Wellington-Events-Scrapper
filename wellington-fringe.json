Dave lives a perfectly normal life--so normal, in fact, that every moment is dictated by The Narrator.

Some help him, some hinder him, but all push him closer to discovering what it really means to take charge of his own destiny.\nBlending voiceover, puppetry, and live performance, A Man Named Dave is a witty and imaginative exploration of self-determination in an absurd world.\n\n",

Bird numbers are way up all over the city - it's a great time to be a bird or bird fan. Learn about the wildlife swooping past you and get excited for a Wellington that becomes wilder every day.\nFree Fact - most k\u0101k\u0101 are left-footed.\nDavid's last Fringe outing was Towards a Better Understanding of the Universe. Theatreview said, \"This is an autobiographical journey told through the Universe. Yes, the goddam amazing universe that we're all a part of. I'm hooked.\" The show also popped over to Melbourne Fringe where reviews glowed it was \"almost as perfect an hour as you could have.\"\nTowards evolved into Tour de Science - a science storytelling show. The Tour was on a bike and pedalled all around Aotearoa (down to Rakiura and up to Kaitaia!). Across 60 towns and cities, audiences loved David's easy-going yarns that sneakily piled on some real education.\nMost recently, David branched out and became Plant Man: a show for children that wondered, \"What would it be like to be a plant?\" Kim Hill asked him about trees and vegetables and described him as \"cool as a cucumber.\"\nBe cool, get hooked and squawk about this new show.

Cycles of creation, preservation, and destruction are upset by dissonant gestural embroideries. Contorted postures and lashing appendages permeate three bodies as they melt towards collapse. Against the backdrop of a world turned sideways, how much pressure can our natural flow of life withstand?\nOperamoth pries open fossilised remains in a gathering of movement, wax, and sinew tethers. Exaggerated forms cascade through scenes of turbulence and harmony. This work presents a tangle of holding self, holding together, and holding none; folding audiences into a dreamlike vista. Meet us at the crest of growth and departure, where surreal pricklings scratch our tangible world.\nHailing from T\u0101maki Makaurau, Ctenophora Co. is a group of dance artists interested in crafting nuanced and imaginative performance pieces. Their works span moments of extreme subtlety to visceral unwindings of movement.\n\n",

The work is an intimate exploration of sisterhood through the lens of Aylin's roots and identity as a Turkish/Pakeha woman.\nFive dancers will explore how sisterhood affects the individual and the group as one entity. Women together in comfort, sharing the same mundane experiences.\nThe games we make up, the\u202c \u202dfuture we see together, the life we romanticise. The culture we are all at the root of, and the\u202c hope there are better days ahead.\nTaking influence from Turkish traditions and Aylin's interest in reflecting the human experience, the audience will witness intertwined female connections that hold up the group and carry stories, memories and values. Viewers will observe how this culture stays rooted in the individual while they are alone and how sisterhood is a bond that keeps things moving. \nIt is a journey of surrendering to the space together and enjoying simplicity, nostalgia, and the tangents relationships have. In contrast to this, it holds a melancholic quality when a dancer is alone. We are a result of the women who raised us. How do we continue to carve this path for others?\n\n",

That meant a year in the chorus line appearing topless before an audience 1,600 onlookers six nights of the week, 52 weeks of the year. \n \nArmed with the lessons of the dressing room - how to apply full body make up, get false eyelashes into place, and of course master the art of wearing a G-string - further adventures took her to the Cannes Film Festival as a rookie reporter. Brushing shoulders with fame at interviews and celebrity parties meant contacts with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Catherine de Neuve and Christopher Reeves. \n \nOnce back in New Zealand in the late eighties, adventuring took a very different form.

In 2024 he delighted audiences at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with his original story, \"Of Course You Are, We All Are,\" lauded as \"witty, wise, touching, [and] indelible\" by Ashley Ramsden, author of The Storyteller's Way.\n\"Takesie-Backsies\" is told in two parts with a brief intermission. The show:\nJordan Dimo lives with a debilitating fear of making major decisions. At each turn, he does everything within his power to keep all of his options on the table for as long as he possibly can, and only when the time to take one course of action or another is undeniably upon him and can not be deferred even a second longer, does he ever choose a path--and then, each time, immediately regrets it.\nWhen Jordan stumbles upon an explosive secret at US Army Corps of Auctioneers, he is suddenly faced with the most impossible decision of all. In the balance hangs the fate of his impulsive older brother, the environmental activist on whom he harbors a hopeless crush, a Quixotic attorney, a megalomanaical colonel, the migratory ducks of North Carolina, and the entire international order.

      "description": "Noah Levinson (US) brings his immersive storytelling style to Aotearoa in Takesie-Backsies, an original piece of absurd and darkly comic fiction.\nIn 2024 he delighted audiences at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with his original story, \"Of Course You Are, We All Are,\" lauded as \"witty, wise, touching, [and] indelible\" by Ashley Ramsden, author of The Storyteller's Way.\n\"Takesie-Backsies\" is told in two parts with a brief intermission.\nThe show: Jordan Dimo lives with a debilitating fear of making major decisions.\nAt each turn, he does everything within his power to keep all of his options on the table for as long as he possibly can, and only when the time to take one course of action or another is undeniably upon him and can not be deferred even a second longer, does he ever choose a path--and then, each time, immediately regrets it.",

Comprised of pianist James 'Muss' Illingworth, drummer Darren 'D' Mathiassen, and bassist Johnny 'JLaw' Lawrence, this trio has forged a unique sound that defies categorization. Soundscapes oscillate between heavy jazz and thumping hip-hop beats, soaring to emotionally powerful improvisations and dissolving into moments of sublime euphoria.\nTheir compositions are a testament to their collective creativity, weaving together intricate polyrhythms, hypnotic melodies, and explosive improvisations that conjure the raw energy of a live performance. Illingworth's piano playing is a masterclass in dynamic range, shifting seamlessly from delicate nuance to thunderous crescendo, often augmented by his deft use of synthesizers and electronic textures. Mathiassen's drumming is a force of nature, his polyrhythmic wizardry propelling the music forward with unstoppable momentum, while Lawrence's bass lines provide the foundation, his earth-shaking tones anchoring the trio's sonic explorations.\nThe trio's connection is palpable, their synergy born of years of collaboration and experimentation. They've worked with some of the biggest names in music, from Shapeshifter to Bliss n Eso to Louis Baker to Allen Stone, and their experience has honed their craft, allowing them to push the boundaries of jazz and beyond.\nWhen D, Muss & JLaw takes the stage, the energy is electric. Their performances are a testament to their deep connection, their music a living, breathing entity that evolves and adapts in the moment. They're not just playing notes - they're conjuring emotions, telling stories, and transporting their audience to a realm of sonic wonder. This is their Third Chapter.\n\n",

Tor is a cyclone of sass and silliness, crassness and charm, equal parts loveable and unhinged.

This is a stand-up storm. Tor sweeps through with the kind of chaotic joy that'll have you wondering if you've witnessed a show, survived a sugar-high goose stampede, or met your new favourite cult leader.\nWhether you're a seasoned comedy-goer or just wandered in for shelter, Tor de Force will leave you breathless, broken with laughter, and asking the most important question of all: is Tor Snyder here to save comedy... or destroy it?\n\n",

Something that we ALL have in common is the natural world we exist in... which we tend to forget or take for granted, however we have our own unique relationships with it. By exploring these connections and broadening our understanding through research, storytelling, and play we will bring these elements to life by personifying them in a theatrical sense. Here we will create our own narrative where we can tell a story that is important to us. We shall build a physical and mental space where our cast, crew, and audience can escape and delve into their inner whimsy while grounding themselves in the natural world around them.\n'Yours Truly' will be a visually striking show with movement/physical theatre, lots of colour and fun costumes which will help us as a team explore and portray our story of the natural world. As for emotions there will be love, yearning, laughter, sadness, nostalgia, basically a place where everything can exist at once. We will bring attention to the small things in life that we forget to notice/feel while also being big and expansive in our imaginations to tell a story that is larger than us.\n\n",
