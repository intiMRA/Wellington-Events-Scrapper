After a wonderful and successful premiere season in Auckland, this vibrant new work is heading to Wellington to delight new audiences.\nSet in a chaotic, bright pink bedroom, Strawberry Baby invites audiences into an intimate, immersive world that captures the messy, playful, and deeply personal experience of growing up and discovering one's identity.\nBlending contemporary dance, storytelling, and humour, the work follows a young girl navigating the pressures of beauty standards, neurodivergence, and queerness -- and the universal desire to belong.\nAt its heart, Strawberry Baby is a joyful act of rebellion against societal expectations, celebrating authenticity, imperfection, and the power of self-acceptance.\nPlayful yet raw, funny yet deeply sincere, Strawberry Baby is a love letter to anyone who's ever felt like they don't quite fit.\n\n",

      "long_description": "\nThe forest is calling! This summer, a new company of players, The Midsummer Botanicals, invite audiences to step beneath the trees and into the wild, wondrous world of As You Like It - a sun-soaked celebration of laughter and community blooming in one of Wellington\u2019s gorgeous parks for the first week of the Wellington Fringe Festival.\nIn 1983, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream lit up the Victoria University Quad and sparked a beloved tradition of outdoor Shakespeare in Wellington - a festival of artistry, friendship, and open-air delight that ran for over forty years. After its sudden end in 2023, a vital chapter of our city\u2019s cultural story seemed to close. But this February, the Botanicals are bringing it gloriously back to life.\nHelmed by director Eli Hancock (he/they) and produced by Shakespeare\u2019s North Productions, As You Like It promises a riotous return to form; where the music is live, the language sparkles, and the forest is very much alive.\n\u201cAs You Like It is Shakespeare at his most joyous,\u201d says Hancock. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding yourself in unexpected places - through love, disguise, friendship, and the wilderness. After years of loss and uncertainty in the arts, this feels like a healing; a reminder of why we make theatre in the first place.\u201d\nSet in a vibrant reimagining of Shakespeare\u2019s Forest of Arden, this production draws on courtyard and marketplace traditions of performance, transforming Wellington\u2019s Aro Valley Park into a living, breathing garden of music, colour, and character. Audiences are invited to arrive early, explore the space, and meet the motley cast of lovers and fools before the story even begins. Expect song, sun, silliness, and the scent of summer roses.\n\n",

Can they do it?\n100 Things is the craziest improv comedy show in T\u0101maki Makaurau, and now it's going on tour!\nImagine if the TV shows Taskmaster and Whose Line Is It Anyway? had a baby ... it'll be kind of like that!\nHow does it work? In an improv show, the improvisers typically ask the audience for a few suggestions that will inform how the show plays out. In 100 Things, the actors will write down -- you guessed it -- 100 things to incorporate into their show, with a little help from the audience.\nONE HUNDRED THINGS, YOU GUYS. IN A ONE HOUR SHOW. They have to use all 100 of them, or the show will be deemed a catastrophic failure! If they pull it off, they'll have set a world record for most ask-fors used in an improv show.\n100 Things has previously applied for and been rejected by the Guinness Book of World Records. The book-keepers over at Guinness may think \"most ask-fors used per minute in an improvised comedy show\" is not a valid world record category, but we sure do! 100 Things is now driven by a powerful desire to prove the Guinness Book of World Records Wrong. This desire leads the team to amazing new heights of improv skill.\n \nIn the meantime, 100 Things has collected a range of other accolades! A sold-out season at Dunedin Fringe 2024.

Desperate for change, she's willing to try anything once (or twice) depending on the circumstances. But it depends. Is isolation the same thing as self-care? Does exercise have to be part of the journey? Would I be happier if I break-up with New Zealand? What is the best rebound country? Come along for this work-in-progress show about finding the humour in being imperfect.\nSince 2018, Miranda has been a regular MC and headline act. Her style of comedy has been described as unapologetic, which to be honest is a pretty amazing feat for a Canadian. A Wellington comedy staple, with Best MC and Best Up & Comer nominations in 2020 at the Wellington Comedy Awards, she's ready to do what it takes to get the life she wants...if only she knew what that was or how to do it.\n\"a snappy, fast paced delivery that has you sitting up in your seat\" - Theatreview\n\"Her material is funny, feminist, at times absurd and often relatable\" - Theatreview\n\n",
