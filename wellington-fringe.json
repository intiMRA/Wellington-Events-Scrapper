      "long_description": "\n3 actors. 60 minutes. 100 things. Can they do it?\n100 Things is the craziest improv comedy show in T\u0101maki Makaurau, and now it's going on tour!\nImagine if the TV shows Taskmaster and Whose Line Is It Anyway? had a baby ... it'll be kind of like that!\nHow does it work? In an improv show, the improvisers typically ask the audience for a few suggestions that will inform how the show plays out. In 100 Things, the actors will write down -- you guessed it -- 100 things to incorporate into their show, with a little help from the audience.\nONE HUNDRED THINGS, YOU GUYS. IN A ONE HOUR SHOW. They have to use all 100 of them, or the show will be deemed a catastrophic failure! If they pull it off, they'll have set a world record for most ask-fors used in an improv show.\n100 Things has previously applied for and been rejected by the Guinness Book of World Records. The book-keepers over at Guinness may think \"most ask-fors used per minute in an improvised comedy show\" is not a valid world record category, but we sure do! 100 Things is now driven by a powerful desire to prove the Guinness Book of World Records Wrong. This desire leads the team to amazing new heights of improv skill.\n \nIn the meantime, 100 Things has collected a range of other accolades! A sold-out season at Dunedin Fringe 2024. Winner of Late Night Knife Fight improv showdown in T\u0101maki Makaurau. And nominated for best ensemble at New Zealand Improv Festival 2024!\n \nPerformed by Rebecca Mary Gwendolon (RAW Comedy finalist), Izzy Renton (Shortland St) and Frankie Browne (Ugly Shakespeare Company): three improvisor besties who can't wait to share this show with you.\n\n",

Dave lives a perfectly normal life--so normal, in fact, that every moment is dictated by The Narrator.

Along the way, his co-workers--appliances, office supplies, and unexpected allies--spring to life. Some help him, some hinder him, but all push him closer to discovering what it really means to take charge of his own destiny.\nBlending voiceover, puppetry, and live performance, A Man Named Dave is a witty and imaginative exploration of self-determination in an absurd world.\n\n",

Follow Hermia as she navigates escaping an arranged marriage, gets lost in the streets with her friends Lysander and Demetrius, stumbles into Oberon's love potion plot, deals with the fairy king's meddling, and then come out the other side with Lysander happily in love with her, and she is magically drugged to love him back. Classic Midsummer! Meanwhile, poor Richard (just call him Dick) is putting on a one-man show for the big wedding, and of course, nothing could possibly go wrong there either. With all the magical transformations and love-potions, the implications for agency and consent could not be clearer; so come along to see this funny, colourful story told again, in a modern setting with updated language, and with modern issues at the core.\n\n",

This summer, a new company of players, The Midsummer Botanicals, invite audiences to step beneath the trees and into the wild, wondrous world of As You Like It - a sun-soaked celebration of laughter and community blooming in one of Wellington\u2019s gorgeous parks for the first week of the Wellington Fringe Festival.\nIn 1983, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream lit up the Victoria University Quad and sparked a beloved tradition of outdoor Shakespeare in Wellington - a festival of artistry, friendship, and open-air delight that ran for over forty years. After its sudden end in 2023, a vital chapter of our city\u2019s cultural story seemed to close. But this February, the Botanicals are bringing it gloriously back to life.\nHelmed by director Eli Hancock (he/they) and produced by Shakespeare\u2019s North Productions, As You Like It promises a riotous return to form; where the music is live, the language sparkles, and the forest is very much alive.\n\u201cAs You Like It is Shakespeare at his most joyous,\u201d says Hancock. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding yourself in unexpected places - through love, disguise, friendship, and the wilderness. After years of loss and uncertainty in the arts, this feels like a healing; a reminder of why we make theatre in the first place.\u201d\nSet in a vibrant reimagining of Shakespeare\u2019s Forest of Arden, this production draws on courtyard and marketplace traditions of performance, transforming Wellington\u2019s Aro Valley Park into a living, breathing garden of music, colour, and character. Audiences are invited to arrive early, explore the space, and meet the motley cast of lovers and fools before the story even begins. Expect song, sun, silliness, and the scent of summer roses.\n\n",

This was probably a terrible idea on their part.\nCome watch this show where scientist turned stand-up comedian Ben Miller explores volcanology, entomology, Hawaiian history, space volcanoes, cats, cookies, and more.\nBen Miller is an NYC based scientist turned comedian who has been working for the past 9 years. In that time, he has performed at all the top clubs in the city such as Broadway Comedy Club, Carolines, and The Stand. Ben was once ranked as the top roast battler in NYC. He has a degree in Materials Science and Engineering, worked on a science bus, 3D printed cookies and has defused a few bar fights while on stage. In 2022, Ben Miller's debut hour, Stand-Up Science, had a completely sold-out run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and he now tours internationally.\n \nPraise for the show:\n \n\"Ben Miller's nerdy and vivid comic mind erupts in this hour-long set!\" - Winnipeg Free Press (4-star review)\n\"Ben does a fantastic job of getting the facts across and making us laugh at the same time! A real and rare treat. - The Mumble (4-star review)\n\"Ben had us laughing until we cried - very funny and very clever! - Audience member\n\n",

Fringe 2015's Best Newcomer finally hatches a new show - a love letter to Wellington and manu we share the city with.\nThis live presentation combines facts, jokes, video, prizes and songs into an engaging slice of science storytelling. Bird numbers are way up all over the city - it's a great time to be a bird or bird fan. Learn about the wildlife swooping past you and get excited for a Wellington that becomes wilder every day.\nFree Fact - most k\u0101k\u0101 are left-footed.\nDavid's last Fringe outing was Towards a Better Understanding of the Universe. Theatreview said, \"This is an autobiographical journey told through the Universe. Yes, the goddam amazing universe that we're all a part of. I'm hooked.\" The show also popped over to Melbourne Fringe where reviews glowed it was \"almost as perfect an hour as you could have.\"\nTowards evolved into Tour de Science - a science storytelling show. The Tour was on a bike and pedalled all around Aotearoa (down to Rakiura and up to Kaitaia!). Across 60 towns and cities, audiences loved David's easy-going yarns that sneakily piled on some real education.\nMost recently, David branched out and became Plant Man: a show for children that wondered, \"What would it be like to be a plant?\" Kim Hill asked him about trees and vegetables and described him as \"cool as a cucumber.\"\nBe cool, get hooked and squawk about this new show. The title says it all - David Klein presents: Birds\n\n",

They've created an 'ear-worm' farm using topics as varied as: the Fencing Act 1979, ever-elusive Hasting's tagger Kron, Huka Falls' boogie boarding dare devil Dr. Bubbles, the perils of kung fu dancing on top of chicken restaurants and the influence of 19th century painting on the hangovers of local librarians.\nThe Svens will sing 70 mins worth of material from their endless 'magnum 'opeless'. This show will be a celebration of national quirks, perks and potholes, baffling and fascinating in equal measure, gloriously short and to the point. There'll be strings, choir and a band. There'll be a multimedia extravaganza. There'll be merch. And there'll be you. This Svens' motto is 'one last shot at obscurity'.

This show will be a celebration of national quirks, perks and potholes, baffling and fascinating in equal measure, gloriously short and to the point. There'll be strings, choir and a band.

So when she's chosen to spearhead a cutting-edge AI project, it feels less like an opportunity and more like a gift-- no, a prayer from God.\nBut exceptional though she may be, she's still human, and still has those human needs we hate to ignore. So when a hot neighbour comes knocking, she just can't run from temptation. Too bad that neighbor might be a little closer to home than she thinks?\nExtra cupa sugar, anyone?\nAs her creation begins to outsmart, out-feel, and out-moral its maker, Liza finds herself asking the one question she never thought she would: what happens when being \"the best\" means you've made something better?\nFresh off the finale of Soho Playhouse Lighthouse series in New York, How to Build a Gate is back in New Zealand bigger and better than ever!\nFeaturing Kate Low and American actor Megan Piggott, How to Build a Gate is a razor-sharp new comedy about control, competition, and the illusion of perfection. In a world that worships innovation though it has long forgotten why, the play takes ambition, ethics, and the burnout of trying to matter under a microscopic glass.\nFrom playwright Electra Artemis--whose self proclaimed \"hooker with a heart of gold\" writing style will keep you laughing right til it doesn't--this Fringe premiere reimagines the God vs Man myth for the startup age. Equal parts satire, soul-searching and a heroine with rockin' a-cups, How to Build a Gate invites audiences to laugh, cringe, and maybe see themselves in Liza's heartfelt, heartless mania.\n\n",

The work is an intimate exploration of sisterhood through the lens of Aylin's roots and identity as a Turkish/Pakeha woman.\nFive dancers will explore how sisterhood affects the individual and the group as one entity. Women together in comfort, sharing the same mundane experiences.\nThe games we make up, the\u202c \u202dfuture we see together, the life we romanticise. The culture we are all at the root of, and the\u202c hope there are better days ahead.\nTaking influence from Turkish traditions and Aylin's interest in reflecting the human experience, the audience will witness intertwined female connections that hold up the group and carry stories, memories and values. Viewers will observe how this culture stays rooted in the individual while they are alone and how sisterhood is a bond that keeps things moving. \nIt is a journey of surrendering to the space together and enjoying simplicity, nostalgia, and the tangents relationships have. In contrast to this, it holds a melancholic quality when a dancer is alone. We are a result of the women who raised us. How do we continue to carve this path for others?\n\n",

That meant a year in the chorus line appearing topless before an audience 1,600 onlookers six nights of the week, 52 weeks of the year. \n \nArmed with the lessons of the dressing room - how to apply full body make up, get false eyelashes into place, and of course master the art of wearing a G-string - further adventures took her to the Cannes Film Festival as a rookie reporter. Brushing shoulders with fame at interviews and celebrity parties meant contacts with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Catherine de Neuve and Christopher Reeves. \n \nOnce back in New Zealand in the late eighties, adventuring took a very different form.

An airplane, an embrace, a swip-swap creating willy sords or perhaps two swords? A loved one, an enemy, a catapult, a shamefully niche musical instrument. Can a clown be a spoon? What actually IS a spoon, really? Does a spork count? Ponder these deep questions and more as Fumble the Clown explores the infinite comedic potential of cutlery.\nIt is unclear where the clown got so many of these metal wonders, or for what purpose. But with a fool's brain, a dancer's body and a determination usually reserved only for the truly idiotic, this charming clown jokes, dances, juggles, sings and invites their audience to join the show, creating an unforgettable hour of ridiculous comedy.\nSpoon Show is the sophomore solo work created by Aotearoa-based dancer-turned-clown Daniel Nodder (Only Bones, ratKing, World of WearableArt 2025), whose work has been described as a \"tour-de-force\", \"beyond human\" and \"pure artistry\".

Comprised of pianist James 'Muss' Illingworth, drummer Darren 'D' Mathiassen, and bassist Johnny 'JLaw' Lawrence, this trio has forged a unique sound that defies categorization. Soundscapes oscillate between heavy jazz and thumping hip-hop beats, soaring to emotionally powerful improvisations and dissolving into moments of sublime euphoria.\nTheir compositions are a testament to their collective creativity, weaving together intricate polyrhythms, hypnotic melodies, and explosive improvisations that conjure the raw energy of a live performance. Illingworth's piano playing is a masterclass in dynamic range, shifting seamlessly from delicate nuance to thunderous crescendo, often augmented by his deft use of synthesizers and electronic textures. Mathiassen's drumming is a force of nature, his polyrhythmic wizardry propelling the music forward with unstoppable momentum, while Lawrence's bass lines provide the foundation, his earth-shaking tones anchoring the trio's sonic explorations.\nThe trio's connection is palpable, their synergy born of years of collaboration and experimentation. They've worked with some of the biggest names in music, from Shapeshifter to Bliss n Eso to Louis Baker to Allen Stone, and their experience has honed their craft, allowing them to push the boundaries of jazz and beyond.\nWhen D, Muss & JLaw takes the stage, the energy is electric. Their performances are a testament to their deep connection, their music a living, breathing entity that evolves and adapts in the moment. They're not just playing notes - they're conjuring emotions, telling stories, and transporting their audience to a realm of sonic wonder. This is their Third Chapter.\n\n",

Armed with wild stories, bad impressions and her favourite weapon of all, crowd work, Tor is a high-energy comic force unlike any other.\nDon't be fooled by the polite Canadian accent. Tor is a cyclone of sass and silliness, crassness and charm, equal parts loveable and unhinged. For over 12 years, she's stormed stages across Australia, leaving audiences gasping for air and clutching their ribs. Now, for the very first time, she's unleashing a full hour of power on Kiwi crowds.\nTor de Force is a laugh-a-minute spectacle riot where no one is safe from her mischievous eye. It's stories spun into absurdity, impressions that hit too close to home, and off-the-cuff crowd work that makes every show different, dangerous, and deliciously fun.\nThis is not polite, sit-and-nod comedy. This is a stand-up storm. Tor sweeps through with the kind of chaotic joy that'll have you wondering if you've witnessed a show, survived a sugar-high goose stampede, or met your new favourite cult leader.\nWhether you're a seasoned comedy-goer or just wandered in for shelter, Tor de Force will leave you breathless, broken with laughter, and asking the most important question of all: is Tor Snyder here to save comedy... or destroy it?\n\n",

Something that we ALL have in common is the natural world we exist in... which we tend to forget or take for granted, however we have our own unique relationships with it. By exploring these connections and broadening our understanding through research, storytelling, and play we will bring these elements to life by personifying them in a theatrical sense. Here we will create our own narrative where we can tell a story that is important to us. We shall build a physical and mental space where our cast, crew, and audience can escape and delve into their inner whimsy while grounding themselves in the natural world around them.\n'Yours Truly' will be a visually striking show with movement/physical theatre, lots of colour and fun costumes which will help us as a team explore and portray our story of the natural world. As for emotions there will be love, yearning, laughter, sadness, nostalgia, basically a place where everything can exist at once. We will bring attention to the small things in life that we forget to notice/feel while also being big and expansive in our imaginations to tell a story that is larger than us.\n\n",
