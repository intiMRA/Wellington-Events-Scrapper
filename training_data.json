The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene.\nTiming:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLecture dates:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

The story involves a 'child' (L'enfant) whose awful behaviour brings an unexpected response: first the furniture rebels, the grandfather clock, the broken china cup, then the mathematics tutor and the Princess in the fairy tale book come to life, and eventually all the animals in the garden - squirrels, dragonfly, birds rise up - all of whom have good reason to 'teach the child a lesson'. It's a fabulous journey that we go on with the child who is confronted by all of these and indeed learns...\n\nThis is a project involving the whole of the Classical Performance programme: the voice students sing all the roles, each performing several roles, the NZSM orchestra will play for the performances, and the piano students are taking part as rehearsal pianists (r\u00e9p\u00e9titeurs) and playing in the orchestra.\n\nLighting design by Alex Fisher, set and costumes by Grace O\u2019Brien, assistant director Theresa Hanaray, chorus master Kathryn Mosley, the show has been coordinated by NZSM Head of Classical Voice Jenny Wollerman in collaboration with the Toi Whakaari technical programme staff, graduates, and students",

For Wayne, his family and his work were his life. They were the source of his life's pleasure and purpose and now he is having to cope with the loss of both.\n\nThe only thing left to take his mind off the pain is cycling with his MAMIL friends, especially Bryan, the central character of MAMIL.

The book will be launched by Harry Ricketts.\n\n- Thursday 18 September, 6pm\n- Unity Books Wellington\n- Free event \u2013 all welcome!\n\nJoseph Kinsey is not a name many of us know \u2013 or not as well as we know the name Robert Falcon Scott. But from his base in Christchurch, Kinsey \u2013 book and art collector, philanthropist, science enthusiast, businessman \u2013 forged deep connections with the Antarctic expeditions and the explorers themselves through his tireless work as the agent for various expeditions. Two other New Zealanders also formed close friendships: Charles Bowen, a former politician, and Wellington lawyer Leonard Tripp, to whom Shackleton declared: \u2018I love you as David and Jonathan loved.\u2019\n\nSouth by South tells the story of New Zealand\u2019s role in \u2018the Heroic Age\u2019, that wave of exploration beginning at the end of the nineteenth century in which men set out to traverse the continent of Antarctica and, if they survived, to bring home their findings. The members of this New Zealander triumvirate were all believers in the British Empire, but the southern voyages were to an uninhabited land.\n\nSouth by South brings to light many letters, newspaper articles, and pieces of official correspondence, much of which has not been published before, during the five expeditions of 1901\u20131916: the Discovery, Nimrod, Terra Nova, Aurora, and Endurance. In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship. What they and the explorers wrote was influenced by nineteenth-century adventure stories which conveyed the Imperialist ideals of the time. If the impending conflict of 1914\u201318 was a very \u2018literary war\u2019, this was a very literary exploration.\n\nCharles Ferrall is an associate professor at Te Herenga Waka\u2013Victoria University of Wellington. Among his books are Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics (2001); The Trials of Eric Mareo (2002), co-written with Rebecca Ellis; East by South: China in the Australasian Imagination (2006), co-edited with Paul Millar and Keren Smith; Juvenile Literature and British Society 1850\u20131950 (2009), co-written with Anna Jackson; Henry Lawson in New Zealand (2012); How We Remember: New Zealanders and the First World War (2014), co-edited with Harry Ricketts; and Remembering Gallipoli: Interviews with New Zealand Gallipoli Veterans (2015), co-edited with Christopher Pugsley.\n\nCover photograph: The ship Discovery leaving Lyttelton Harbour, 1901.

These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand. The Trust was established to support leading tax policy thinking in New Zealand. You can read about the Trust\u2019s work here.\nAbout the presenter\nMichael (Mick) Keen is a former Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, where for over twenty years he played a central role in shaping and delivering IMF policies and advice on tax matters.\nHe has advised finance ministries in all parts of the world, including missions to over forty countries, and led the preparation of influential papers for the G20 and the Executive Board of the IMF.\nBefore joining the Fund, Mick was Professor of Economics at the universities of Essex (UK), Queens (Canada) and Kyoto, and is now Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo.\nMick was the keynote speaker at the 2014 conference on the Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand and has provided peer review for Inland Revenue\u2019s previous Long-Term Insights Briefing.\nMick has jointly authored, with Joel Slemrod, Rebellion, Rascals and Revenue \u2013 an entertaining account of how history illuminates the perennial challenges and timeless principles of taxation\u2014and how the past holds clues to solving the tax problems of today.\nAbout this seminar series\nNew ideas, innovative concepts, research evidence and expert advice are all crucial to stimulate and inform the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis and advice. Our current theme for guest lectures - Fiscal Policy for the Future - explores the role of stabilising, sustainable and effective fiscal policy. Speakers provide insights into how fiscal policy can be designed to support government to meet its current and future objectives and obligations while adapting to changing circumstances and delivering value to the New Zealand public.\nFiscal policy has a stabilising role in helping to smooth the business cycle, while sustainability in fiscal policy is foundational for resilience to both shocks and longstanding challenges, such as climate change, technological advancements, and demographic trends. Ensuring effective and value for money expenditure is important so that fiscal policy contributes to the living standards of New Zealanders, both now and in the future.\nPlease note that the views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series are those of the individual presenters. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the New Zealand Treasury or the New Zealand Government.\nFor updates and our latest research visit: www.treasury.govt.nz\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to be the first to hear about our upcoming events in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series, please SUBSCRIBE to stay up to date.",

Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years. She directed One Night Band which won 'Most Original Production' at the Wellington Theatre Awards 2023, and performs regularly as both a player and musician for POPROX.\nISAAC THOMAS has been an improviser and improv musician for a decade in P\u014dneke and Whakat\u016b/Nelson. He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2025. We'll giveaway any spots remaining a few days before the first workshop of the course, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email poproximprov@gmail.com and we'll pop you on the SBL.

They can also bring their own half made ring shanks or other projects to set into.\nThey will start by creating claw settings for flat-bottomed stones on plate to gain an understanding of how claws work.\nStudents will then move on to faceted stones and be shown how to construct their own settings in a number of styles, and how to secure their stones in settings. Finally, they will be taught the dos and don\u2019ts of finishing settings to a salable level.\nThe workshop will also look at how to use pre-made claw settings to best advantage.\nWorkshop fee $245, Early bird $221 till 27 July.

    "description": "The Art of Mending - Micro Mill, When it comes to the clothes we love, every rip, stain, and imperfection is an invitation to exercise agency, expression, and an opportunity to show the garment how much we appreciate it.\n\nThis class is cared for by the whimsical Aisha, a multidisciplinary artist with a passion for empowering the mending process. Each month on Wednesday evenings Aisha will introduce us to a different technique for reviving our beloved textile pieces. If you're like us and have a box of clothing in need of repairs that never seems to empty... this is the club for you. With three events a month we'll inspire each other to creatively care for those pieces we love! This club is also perfect for anyone who loves learning new skills. Techniques we'll cover are lino printing, patching, darning, felting, embroidery, beading, sashiko, fabric painting and more! All materials and tools are supplied at each class - but you are welcome to bring your own. We highly encourage bringing those clothes or other textile items that need some love and repair.\n\nThere is no need to attend every class. We can catch you up on the skill at which ever class you choose to join us at. There are single class tickets or monthly sign ups available. Both of these have variable pricing options, unwaged/student, waged, and generous. Please choose whichever option feels right for you and your circumstances!\n\nIn August we are Lino Printing!\nClass 02: 20th August\nAt this class Aisha will take us through the process of designing and cutting our own lino to print with!

Bring in larger project items, print with the lino cuts you made in the previous week, or cut some fresh ones!\n\nIn September we are patching!\nClass 01: 10th September\nAisha will take us through the process of sewing on patches. Patches that we printed in the August classes will be available for this. You're welcome to bring your own patches as well. Please bring something that needs a patch up or a little bit of decoration.\n\nClass 02: 17th September\nAt this class we will learn how to appliqu\u00e9, the process of using scrap fabric to make decorative patches. This is a great way to elevate a rip or stain with some visible mending.\n\nClass 03: 24th September\nAt this last class of the month we'll be open for all the patching needs. Hang out and finish projects we've started or mend some extra items.\n\nBe sure to check our website or here for updates about techniques coming up in the following months.",

Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly.

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

Despite progress for some groups, the Pacific population remains on the wrong side of the statistical ledger.\nPacific peoples experience:\n\u2022 The highest rates of avoidable hospitalisations and chronic conditions.\n\u2022 Worst material deprivation across nearly every indicator.\n\u2022 Persistently low home ownership rates.\n\u2022 A widening education achievement gap, often masked by ethnic averages.\n\u2022 Underrepresentation in decision-making, leadership, and governance roles.\nWhile initiatives for M\u0101ori advancement are critical and must continue, Pacific peoples require their own distinct policy lens.

We were also making experimental attempts into the world of radio, with the birth of Mouthfull\u2019s first international streaming server, playing music 24/7 (also live events a few times a week).\nIf we travel even further back in time, 2017 was the debut of the \u201cMouthfull Radio\u201d episodic series (~20eps) - but we consider the ongoingness the real thing to celebrate.\nMoving towards present day ~ through a vast richness of hosts, events, music, shows, zines, selectors, connections, pop ups, and story-times. It is a real joy to help community contemporary radio ripple out from this Pacific Island nation to the world wide web.\n\n5 Years goes so fast, and so we shall honour this time with a great celebration in the capital city of Aotearoa! We will bring together all of the elements of Mouthfull you have known to love; make some books, make up some new dance moves with friends, and make our ears glisten in the sounds of live and selected music.\nWhiro // New Moon. The last dark night of winter. A time for reflection; an invitation to come together as friends and wh\u0101nau and plant intentional seeds for future flowers to bloom, as well as rest in deep listening and shared beingness.\n\nLineup:\n*\u00baJuniper May\n*\u00baStar Time\n*\u00baajhoneysuckle (t\u0101maki)\n*\u00baMystery Waitress (duo)\n*\u00baDJ B.Lo (wh\u0101katu)\n*\u00b0Benny Salvador\n\n\nWe are also releasing our first ever compilation. This special event will be opened with a premiere listening session of the full CD, playing the album all the way through. You can purchase a physical copy at the show, or on bandcamp (preorders open September 1st).\n5PM sharp CD push play. Some divine collaborators with unique new releases on offer.\n\nThis is a fundraiser to support the sustainability of Mouthfull. We are only able to pay the bills due to events like this, and are fundraising to support a long awaited update of our digital infrastructure to enable future support. THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT - you can support us by purchasing a ticket (extra donation if you are balling), a tshirt, a raffle ticket, or a zine - it all goes to the same goal of enabling & uplifting one another.\n",

By 1917 the system had grown and 17 was rebuilt into its current form adding a set of trucks converting the tram to 8 wheels. Tram tram saw regular service until the 1940\u2019s where it was eventually use for peak time travel, before being withdrawn in the late 50\u2019s.\nIt was then sold, and taken to Bell road in Raumati on the Kapiti coast where it served as a beach hutt until the 80\u2019s where it was donated to the Wellington tramway museum for display and eventual restoration.\n2014 a conservation and restoration plan was put together, and the tram was shipped out to the Wheelwright Shop in the Wairarapa for a full body overhaul. It was transported back to the museum in 2017 and put on public display until new trucks (wheelsets) could be manufacturedby A&G price in Thames.\nSince 2019 the tram has undergone new wiring, and extensive testing and running in and is now ready to take passengers along our museum.\nTram 17 is a wonderful achievement by all\nThose involved, and we cannot wait to welcome you this Father\u2019s Day to enjoy a ride on this heritage tram, saved from the scrap heap, and then saved again from rotting away.\nPlease note: We intend to run tram 17, however due to the nature and style of the tram, its operation is weather dependent.

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene and GIB.\nCPD points: 10\nTIMING:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLECTURE DATES:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa.

    "description": "The Monster in the Maze, The myth of the Minotaur is a tale almost as old as storytelling itself, but with The Monster in the Maze Jonathan Dove and Alisdair Middleton have excavated rich, new life from this classic. In this brand new staging by director Anapela Polataivao (Red White and Brass, Wild Dogs Under My Skirt), this story will be told as never before.\n\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he metes out his punishment in the cruellest way possible: by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth, to be fed to the terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze: the Minotaur. As King Minos triumphs, his great monster \u201cwill eat your future, it will rip your hope, it will stamp your youth, your children in the sand.\u201d\n\nAs the vindictive king will soon learn, however, these youth will not accept their fate without a fierce challenge. The Monster in the Maze is a story about resistance; about justice; about finding power not in oppression, but in collectivism. Fittingly, then, it\u2019s also a groundbreaking work in its form: a community-focused and community-driven opera in which young and community singers and players stand proudly shoulder-to-shoulder with their professional counterparts, and in which both are integral.\n\nThe Monster in the Maze has been roundly praised by audiences, participants and reviewers worldwide, and in its Aotearoa debut season, it will serve as a gorgeous articulation of New Zealand Opera\u2019s reciprocal community kaupapa.\n\nSung in English with surtitles.",

The inclusion of considerable footage from Jacinda's partner Clarke Gayford provides a deeply personal view of life as the Prime Minister in very challenging times.\n(Los Angeles Times review) 'Prime Minister' is not interested in wrangling, dealing and lawmaking, or even the nuts and bolts or her progressive views. ..

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

    "description": "Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal International Order, Abstract\nOver the last decade, China has punished countries that undermine its territorial claims and foreign policy goals with measures such as restricting trade, encouraging popular boycotts, and cutting off tourism. These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

    "description": "The Liberal International Order as a Core-Periphery Order: An Alternative History with Multiple Deep Contestations, I offer an alternative macrohistory of the Liberal International Order (LIO) that was explicitly designed to perpetuate Western dominance and American hegemony. The LIO is better understood as a core-periphery order because inequality between the Western-core and the \u2018Restern\u2019-periphery was constitutive of it. (Re-)Imperialism\u2014not just liberalism\u2014remained a central ordering mechanism well after 1945. I show the two-way deep contestations between the liberal and anticolonial ordering projects, especially at the 1955 Bandung Conference. Contra the post-LIO pessimism of disorder/chaos, I argue that the normative agency of the Southeast Asian states informed by the legacy of Bandung is heralding a multiplex, multi-regional world order. As the declining inequality between the West and Asia transforms the core-periphery LIO, the emergent decentered world order will lack a core, whether Western/liberal or Asian. This deep transformation should be welcomed, not deeply contested, although coexistence and global integration require embracing deep pluralism, not liberalism.\nManjeet S. Pardesi is Associate Professor of International Relations in the Political Science and International Relations Programme, and Asia Research Fellow at the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. His research interests include World Orders and World/Global History, Great Power Politics, Asian security, and the Sino-Indian rivalry.

Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops.

    "description": "Inner infrastructure for Outer Resilience, In times of polycrisis and uncertainty, more people are coming around to the need not for more information, but for integration and presence.\nThis 90-minute session offers a safe, grounded space to slow down, reconnect with ourselves, and explore the inner terrain of change-making, and of our relational space.\nAs Rumi reminds us: \u201cYesterday I was clever and tried to change the world; today I am wise and am changing myself.\u201d\nBuilding our inner infrastructure - our relationship with self, with our feelings, with others and with nature - is foundational to how we show up in the world.\nWe will begin by discussing research into how distraction or numbing our discomfort is an intelligent and common short-term survival strategy, but in fact is one which limits our long-term capacity to connect, lead and evolve. We will then guide participants in somatic practices to offer accessible ways to reconnect with your agency.\nDuring this session, you will gain tools to increase your inner awareness, expand your bandwidth of awareness, and integrate emotion, sensation, and story. Together we\u2019ll explore the role of perception in our orientation to life and the choices we make, how our narratives can connect us with our agency, the power of curiosity, and dive into how our relational presence can often have more impact than our opinions.\nThis session is an invitation to restore connection, calm, and courage, to become more whole, more fully human, and more ready for what this moment is asking of us.\nAbout your host\nFreda is a curator, engagement practitioner, and connector, who works at the intersection of social change, community-building, and inner development. She is the Founder of the Goodlife Collective, which curates spaces that build connection, wellbeing and collective wisdom.\nDrawing on yoga teaching, somatic practices and adult development, Freda is interested in how we build our inner infrastructure - the capacity to work through discomfort, reconnect with our agency, and bring greater presence to relationships. Her background is in psychology, environmental-science and design, and she loves nerding out on ideas and conversations about unlocking our collective potential.",

When we connect to our inner foundations, we touch the support of those who came before and deepen our sense of belonging to life itself.\nWe\u2019ll begin with ceremonial cacao, then drop into a guided movement journey with live soundscape. There are no steps to learn, no performance\u2014just presence, curiosity, and letting your body move as it feels. Barefoot and phone-free, you\u2019re invited to drop deep into free-form movement, awakening parts of you that you may have forgotten.\nCome as you are.\nMove with what you feel.\nLeave feeling empowered, connected, and alive.\nSomatic dance is a guided movement practice that helps you tune into your body\u2019s wisdom and move from the inside out. Unlike ecstatic dance, which is typically an open, DJ-led space with no facilitation, somatic dance offers gentle guidance to support you in exploring sensation, emotion, and embodiment in a safe, intentional way. You\u2019re not learning steps or performing\u2014you're being invited into presence, curiosity, and feeling. With a focus on nervous system regulation, personal expression, and inner listening, somatic dance creates a nurturing space to come home to yourself.\nYour Hosts...\nJenna Joan | Embodiment Facilitator\nJenna Joan is a somatic therapist, yoga teacher, and group facilitator who has been leading movement spaces for over 15 years. With a background in yoga, somatic dance, and therapeutic embodiment, her work blends play, authenticity, and deep nervous system awareness. Jenna is also a cacao alchemist and ceremonial facilitator, known for creating safe, soulful spaces that invite freedom, connection, and inner exploration. She has been hosting workshops, retreats, and community events for nearly a decade, and also works 1:1 in more therapeutic settings.\nSonic Sutra | Somatic Dance DJ\nSonic Sutra is a sound artist and somatic dance DJ who creates immersive musical journeys designed to support authentic movement, emotional release, and deep embodiment. With a focus on somatic dance and therapeutic soundscapes, their sets are intentionally curated to guide dancers through an inner experience\u2014honouring the body\u2019s natural rhythms and the intelligence within. Their offerings create safe, accessible spaces for people of all bodies, backgrounds, and experience levels to explore movement, presence, and connection. Rooted in play, precision, and deep listening, Sonic Sutra brings music that moves beyond entertainment\u2014into healing and transformation.",

    "description": "Men's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection, Men\u2019s Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\nIn a world where men are often expected to have everything figured out, this gathering offers a space to be genuine, not perfect.\nThis is a free event, with an optional plant-based dinner available for $15. While there\u2019s no obligation to stay for dinner, sharing a meal together offers a meaningful way to strengthen connections. Andre and Sri Jiva co-host this circle with a shared passion for creating authentic, supportive spaces where men can connect deeply\u2014offering this gathering simply because they believe in its importance.\nThe Men\u2019s Circle provides a safe and nurturing environment where men can share openly, express their feelings, and encourage personal growth\u2014free from societal pressures to be stoic or self-reliant. Through honest sharing and collective support, participants build resilience, deepen self-awareness, and strengthen their sense of identity and purpose.\nStructure of the Circle\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.\nA short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center. Only the person holding the object may speak, ensuring uninterrupted sharing.\nOpen Sharing: Anyone may choose to share while holding the object. Sharing is optional, and passing is always respected.\nActive Listening: While one person shares, others listen attentively without speaking, interrupting, or offering advice. The focus is on witnessing and being present.\nNo Judgments or Advice: Participants refrain from judging or offering unsolicited advice, creating a safe space for authentic expression.\nClosing: The circle may conclude with a group reflection, a moment of gratitude, or a simple acknowledgment of the shared experience.\nCircle Agreements\nSupportive Environment: We are here to uplift and support one another, fostering trust and brotherhood.\nFocus on the Present: Share what's alive for you now, focusing on your emotions and experiences to deepen emotional awareness.\nUse \"I\" Statements: Speak from your personal perspective using \"I\" statements to promote authenticity and responsibility. Avoid generalizations like \"we\" or \"us.\"\nNo Judgment or fixing: Refrain from judging others sharing or offering unsolicited advice, ensuring a safe and non-critical space.\nConfidentiality: What is shared in the circle stays in the circle. You may discuss your own experience outside the group, but keep others' details private.\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n................................................................................................\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

    "description": "Bar Crossing Seminar - Manawat\u016b (Foxton bar), Crossing A Bar? We Can Help\nBar crossings can be one of the trickiest, and riskiest parts of boating in Aotearoa. They change fast, they don\u2019t always play nice, and they\u2019ve caught out even the most experienced skippers. Each year, we see serious incidents and tragedies happening on our bars, so it\u2019s super important to know your stuff before you head out.\nThat\u2019s where we come in. Join us at Manawatu Marine Boating Club for a free and relaxed seminar. You\u2019ll hear straight from local Coastguard skippers and boating legends who\u2019ll share their real-world tips, local knowledge, and a few stories from the water.\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover (and chat about):\n\nUnderstanding the local features of your bar\nReading and interpreting the conditions when planning a trip\nGetting your boat and your crew bar crossing ready\nHow to handle your boat while crossing\nHow to do a bar crossing report (and why it\u2019s worth it)\nWhat to do if things go pear-shaped\nIt\u2019s interactive \u2013 so bring your questions, share your own experiences, and have a yarn with others in the boating community.\nBring your mates too \u2013 whether they\u2019re brand new to boating or have been around since the days of paper charts and handheld compasses, there\u2019s something in here that could save a trip\u2026 or a life.\n Why it matters:\nIn 2024, 23% of craft-related drownings happened during bar crossings.\n5 lives were lost due to capsizing while crossing a bar.\nOlder blokes are still the most at-risk \u2013 but everyone can make safer choices with the right knowledge (and a lifejacket on).",

It\u2019s also just a different & cool way of meeting new people by getting a bit out of your comfort zone and skipping the small talk!\nJoin us for games, talks, and connections with friends you haven\u2019t met yet. Join if you get annoyed after being asked what you do, where you are from, and how long you have been in Wellington every single time you meet someone. If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll never have to speak in public if you don\u2019t want to!\n\nHOW TO JOIN?\nTake 2 minutes to fill out our form\n\nhttps://lu.ma/ftstwellington6\nOur events are limited to 30 handpicked guests to ensure a cozy atmosphere. We prioritize a balance in gender and cultural diversity, making each gathering a unique blend of perspectives! If you're invited you'll receive an invite with a special link via our ticketing platform Luma\n\nHOW MUCH IS IT?\nThe cost to attend is NZD 23 (early llama) - NZD 25 (general llama) and includes the following:\n3 hours of facilitated and curated activities\nLight snacks to keep the energy going (only if outdoors)\nA space to meet new people in the least boring way possible\nSupporting our mission to slowly eliminate small talk around the world\nAlso includes those pesky ticket fees!\n\nWHERE IS IT?\nWe host our events in awesome cafes, rooftops, and bars across the city. We only reveal the location to ticket holders 24 hours before the event.\n\nWHAT THEY SAY\n\u201cGreat way to connect with people in a more meaningful way. Get to the heart of the matter, dive straight into what really counts!\u201d - Matthias\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of activity humanity needs every weekend. Thank you for all.\u201d - Sonya\n\n\u201cF*ck the Small Talk changes the narrative from \"Where are you from?\" to \"When was the last time you laughed uncontrollably?\" and I think that's beautiful.\u201d - Monika\n\n\u201cI loved F*ck the small talk, I was a little bit nervous at first but they are pros at making you feel comfortable with the rest of the group, the activities are really fun and I enjoyed every second (consider that the one who's saying this is very, very shy). Give it a try!\u201d - Brenda\n\n\"it\u2019s a wonderful experience, it\u2019s like being a kid again, when you were at the park, playing with other kids, and just decided you were going to be best friends for the next hours. Maybe you\u2019ll never see those kids again. But that hour was amazing because you both opened up and trusted each other.\" - Sara\n\n\u201cLively, interesting, introspective, completely open and no judgement.

Why?\nWe usually get a high volume of sign-ups yet we like to keep it cozy & only about 30 people. We believe this is a good number to ensure an awesome experience! Please try again next time if do not receive an invite - no hard feelings\n\n\u2022 Why do you charge?\nWe value our time and put a lot of love, planning, and effort into creating & designing these experiences.\nThis is our project/business and what we give to the world and we think everything should be a fair exchange! However, money should never be the reason for people not to attend. If you can\u2019t afford it simply get in touch with us\n\n\u2022 I'm digging this! Can I get involved somehow?\nSure thing, send us a message!\n\n\u2022 Can I bring my cute dog/llama?\nIt depends on where the event is! Message us to make sure.

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers.

With releases on Infernal Sounds and Leather Kennel, Dusty has proven himself to be a force to be reckoned with, and is surely one of the most exciting young producers in the game today.\nOn closing duties we have the Support Your Local crew going b2b with Young Gho$t to round out the night with a bit of silliness.\nWe\u2019ve managed to secure an all-new inner city warehouse location for this one, and its Further Sound on soundsystem duties this time, heating things up with their BANSHEE SOUNDSYSTEM, preparing for only its second full rollout after Cuba Dupa this year.\nWe\u2019re unbelievably excited to share this space with you all for a dance and are expecting this to be one for the books.Secure your tickets now and don\u2019t miss out on this momentous and legendary dance music event!\nTickets: https://events.humanitix.com/coki-uk-warehouse-rave ",

Fronted by the enigmatic Ruth Carr, her coy persona ignites while bandmates Ryan Beehre and Paul Dodge forge rib-rattling beats around her.\nTheir debut album, The 88, released in 2003, achieved gold status in New Zealand, quickly followed up by the 'I Hate Guns' EP.\nOver the following decade, the trio toured their synths and samplers from Helsinki to Hanoi crafting their own refreshing sound \u2013 storming The Crystal Method's club night in LA, the FabricLive birthday bash in London, and headlining the Hanoi Music Festival in Vietnam. Along with festivals and shows up and down Aotearoa.\nHaving been retired since 2014, we\u2019re excited to announce that Minuit are back onstage for a limited number of reunion shows.\nThese reunion performances will pay tribute to classic tunes from all four albums 'The Boy with the Aubergine Hair', 'Except You', 'Fuji', 'Menace', \u2018Aotearoa\u2019, \u2018I Hate Guns\u2019, \u2018A Room Full of Cute\u2019, 'Last Night You Saw This Band', \u201825 Bucks\u2019 \u2013 everything gets a look in, plus a couple of other surprises.\nThe show will be supported by Western Haikus and JOLA BURNS.\nMinuit has a heart.

In 2023 Louisa won the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award for her piece Dream Within A Dream, and in 2024 Louisa received a composition commission from the Wellington Jazz Festival and headlined the festival with the new work, The Chasm Where We Fall Into Each Other.

This series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\nEach of the evenings will bring a different electronic vibe, conjured by some of Wellington\u2019s most innovative artists. The series lineup includes:\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\nTickets are available from Wednesday 18 June, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\nAbout the Artists\nLudus\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\nStephen Gallagher\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\nDavid Long\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\nJules Desmond\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\nOghum\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\nJess Chambers\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration.

The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\n\nMaitreya\u2019s priorities\n\nTo help humanity in its task of global transformation, Maitreya has formulated certain priorities. They cover the essential needs of all people, every woman, man and child: an adequate supply of food\u037e housing for all; healthcare and education as basic universal rights. Other top priorities include the restoration of the environment and the establishment of peace.\n\nThe key to achieving these goals requires a major shift of present mind-set and thinking, structures and systems \u2013 and more equitable sharing of the world\u2019s food and resources. To realise humanity is one global family and the planet is a living being.

Dame Anne Salmond writes of \u2018competing cosmologies\u2019 and \u2018ontological collisions\u2019 \u2014 European missionaries arriving in Aotearoa in the early 19th century brought a Biblical cosmology that began such a collision. In this public lecture Bradford Haami will explore the interactions between Biblical and M\u0101ori cultural and spiritual worldviews that continue to evolve up to the present.\n* How do Biblical and M\u0101ori cultural and spiritual beliefs and thought relate?\n* How 19th century rangatira negotiate between traditional beliefs and the Biblical narratives?\n* Where do Christian and M\u0101ori ways of knowing and seeing clash, compete or enrich each other?\n* What does being M\u0101ori and Christian look like today?\n\nBradford Haami (Ng\u0101ti Awa) is a M\u0101ori historian, researcher and author with research interests in M\u0101ori worldviews, spirituality, Christianity and cultural preservation.

Each of the six laps is slightly over 7km, with around 400m in elevation (2500m in total). Try not to trip on a loose rock while taking in the aromatic smells emanating from the tip.

It\u2019s not even that fun.\nThis is a race for those that want a little more from life than the ordinary.

You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",
