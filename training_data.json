Picture golden sunsets, flamingos, thatched umbrellas and the carefree buzz of a sun-soaked getaway, right in the heart of Wellington. No passport required.\r\n\r\nThe menu is vibrant and full of escapist flair. Start with coconut prawns and banana blossom kokoda, then dive into mains like mango glazed  pork rib rack or the tropical tofu paneer curry. Save room for dessert: pineapple upside-down pudding or a coconut rum fondue to bring the tropical fantasy to a sweet finale. Behind the bar, the tiki and kava-spiked cocktails flow freely, from Blue Hawaiian\u2019s to retro rum punches, all dressed to impress with flamingo stirrers, umbrellas and tropical garnishes.\r\n\r\nA golden-age soundtrack sets the mood, featuring the smooth calypso of Harry Belafonte, beachy vibes from The Beach Boys, and sun-drenched classics by Astrud Gilberto.\r\n\r\nClub Tropicana is a winter getaway, fun and fabulously over the top."

Menus are created on the spot, and dishes are served to a buzzing, hungry crowd. It\u2019s fast-paced, creative chaos with serious culinary skills on display. Guests get a front-row seat to the action, while supporting a truly game-changing enterprise.\r\n\r\n4 August \u2014 Jessie Gibberd, Loretta\r\nOriginally from rural Waikato, Jessie Gibberd made the move to Wellington to study, but it was the buzz of hospitality that captured her heart. Swapping textbooks for tongs, she left her degree behind to dive headfirst into the kitchen. Now a chef de partie at Loretta, Jessie brings a grounded, fresh perspective to one of the city\u2019s most beloved eateries.\r\n\r\n11 August \u2014 Felipe Molina, El Matador\r\nHailing from Chile, Felipe Molina is a professional chef with over 15 years of experience in kitchens around the world. Having worked in several countries and world-class restaurants, Felipe brings a global sensibility to his craft. With a passion for seafood, meats, and bold, expressive flavours, his cooking is shaped by travel and tradition, blending international influence with creativity on every plate.\r\n\r\n18 August \u2014 Zane Gupwell, Graze\r\nZane Gupwell began his hospitality journey at just 15, washing dishes at a local caf\u00e9 in Mount Eden. From there, he headed to Queenstown, learning from a wide range of chefs and kitchen styles before challenging himself with a move to Wellington. Since then, he\u2019s worked at some of the city\u2019s top restaurants and now brings his thoughtful, evolving style to Graze Wine Bar.\r\n\r\n25 August \u2014 Lulu Temmuyin, Mr Go\u2019s\r\nLulu Temmuyin is a chef who loves pushing boundaries, even when they\u2019re unexpected. Lactose intolerant but obsessed with cheese, and not a fan of lamb but winner of a lamb cooking competition, Lulu is all about surprises. At Mr Go\u2019s, she brings bold, sustainable flavour to the forefront, blending personality with punch in every dish.\r\n\r\nEverybody Eats runs on a pay-what-you-can model, transforming food waste into gourmet meals and bringing the community together over good kai. The Next Gen Cook Off celebrates and champions this mission, proving that rescued food can be next-level delicious.\r\n\r\nThe Next Gen Cook Off is proudly supported by The Gas Hub."

The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025"

Samba de Gafieira is danced to the Brazilian samba musical rhythms and must be distinguished from the ballroom Samba, danced in International Latin and American Rhythm ballroom dance styles.\nCheck out this demo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMGlfr3zA5w\nIt appeared in the 1940s and it gets its name from the Gafieira \u2013 popular urban nightclubs of Rio de Janeiro at that time. The dance derived from the Maxixe and followed the arrival of the Choro (another samba musical style). It left most of the Maxixe\u2019s Polka elements behind but maintained the entwined leg movements of the Argentine Tango, although adopting a more relaxed posture than the latter. Many see this form of Samba as a combination of Waltz and Tango."

Allan Herbarium, Manaaki Whenua \u2013 Landcare Research, Lincoln.\nCall them billy-buttons, drumstick flowers, billy balls, sun balls (in Australia) or woollyheads and puatea in New Zealand, or with their scientific name Craspedia (Gnaphalieae, Compositae/Asteraceae), these everlasting daisies are conspicuous members of many plant communities in New Zealand and Australia but remain an outstanding taxonomic challenge.\nIn 1961, based on a small number of available herbarium specimens, HH Allan\u2019s Flora of New Zealand volume 1 recorded just 6 species in New Zealand. However, the 1992 and 1993 checklists of Tony Druce, who made extensive field observations and collected numerous herbarium specimens, distinguished more than 45 undescribed entities that might warrant taxonomic recognition.\nMorphological variation in New Zealand Craspedia is complex, making the definition and circumscription of species problematic. At least in part, this difficulty is the legacy of an extremely rapid and recent diversification of the genus in New Zealand\u2014a scenario that produces challenges for genetic as well as morphological approaches to delimiting species."
