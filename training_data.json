    "description": "Intro to Musical Improv | A PopRox Improv Course, Musical improv can be absolute magic. Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years. She directed One Night Band which won 'Most Original Production' at the Wellington Theatre Awards 2023, and performs regularly as both a player and musician for POPROX.\nISAAC THOMAS has been an improviser and improv musician for a decade in P\u014dneke and Whakat\u016b/Nelson. He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2025. We'll giveaway any spots remaining a few days before the first workshop of the course, on a first-come-first-serve basis.

    "description": "'WOMB WOMEN' Workshop for Women, IMAGINE...100 THOUSAND GRANDMOTHERS SPANNING BACK THROUGH 2.5 MILLION YEARS OF HUMANITY. ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!! This booking is for FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER\n                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cWithin the DNA is written not only our histories as individuals but the whole history of the human race \u2026 patterns of DNA that have come down to us virtually unchanged from our distant ancestors \u2013 ancestors who are no longer just an abstract entity but real people who lived in conditions very different from those we enjoy today, who survived them and brought up their children.\u201d ~ Bryan Sykes (The Seven Daughters of Eve)\nReturn to MAIN EXHIBITION WEBSITE - link coming soon",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene.\nTiming:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLecture dates:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

    "description": "Treasury Guest Lecture with Michael Keen: IN-PERSON attendance, Join us for our special Fiscal Policy for the Future seminar\nNew Zealand faces significant long-term fiscal challenges, including the rising costs associated with an ageing population, increasing demand for public services, and the need to adapt to a changing global economy. These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand. The Trust was established to support leading tax policy thinking in New Zealand. You can read about the Trust\u2019s work here.\nAbout the presenter\nMichael (Mick) Keen is a former Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, where for over twenty years he played a central role in shaping and delivering IMF policies and advice on tax matters.\nHe has advised finance ministries in all parts of the world, including missions to over forty countries, and led the preparation of influential papers for the G20 and the Executive Board of the IMF.\nBefore joining the Fund, Mick was Professor of Economics at the universities of Essex (UK), Queens (Canada) and Kyoto, and is now Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo.\nMick was the keynote speaker at the 2014 conference on the Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand and has provided peer review for Inland Revenue\u2019s previous Long-Term Insights Briefing.\nMick has jointly authored, with Joel Slemrod, Rebellion, Rascals and Revenue \u2013 an entertaining account of how history illuminates the perennial challenges and timeless principles of taxation\u2014and how the past holds clues to solving the tax problems of today.\nAbout this seminar series\nNew ideas, innovative concepts, research evidence and expert advice are all crucial to stimulate and inform the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis and advice. Our current theme for guest lectures - Fiscal Policy for the Future - explores the role of stabilising, sustainable and effective fiscal policy. Speakers provide insights into how fiscal policy can be designed to support government to meet its current and future objectives and obligations while adapting to changing circumstances and delivering value to the New Zealand public.\nFiscal policy has a stabilising role in helping to smooth the business cycle, while sustainability in fiscal policy is foundational for resilience to both shocks and longstanding challenges, such as climate change, technological advancements, and demographic trends. Ensuring effective and value for money expenditure is important so that fiscal policy contributes to the living standards of New Zealanders, both now and in the future.\nPlease note that the views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series are those of the individual presenters. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the New Zealand Treasury or the New Zealand Government.\nFor updates and our latest research visit: www.treasury.govt.nz\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to be the first to hear about our upcoming events in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series, please SUBSCRIBE to stay up to date.",

    "description": "Financial Planning for Retirement, Financially successful people don\u2019t achieve their wealth by accident \u2013 they make and execute clear plans. Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".\n\n1 Day\nPresented by Paul and Mary-Ellen Gadd.",

The inclusion of considerable footage from Jacinda's partner Clarke Gayford provides a deeply personal view of life as the Prime Minister in very challenging times.\n(Los Angeles Times review) 'Prime Minister' is not interested in wrangling, dealing and lawmaking, or even the nuts and bolts or her progressive views. ..

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

There they influenced local customs, made an enduring contribution to Samoan cuisine introducing contemporary favourites such as sapasui (chop suey), keke pua\u2018a (pork buns) and of course laisa (rice). \r\n\r\nDragons celebrate this cultural and culinary fusion by showcasing these favourites and presenting new dishes highlighting the shared love of culinary staples such as taro and noodles, rice, fish, and pork, the magnificent spectrum of Chinese herbs, spices and flavours.

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.",

    "description": "Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal International Order, Abstract\nOver the last decade, China has punished countries that undermine its territorial claims and foreign policy goals with measures such as restricting trade, encouraging popular boycotts, and cutting off tourism. These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods.

    "description": "The Liberal International Order as a Core-Periphery Order: An Alternative History with Multiple Deep Contestations, I offer an alternative macrohistory of the Liberal International Order (LIO) that was explicitly designed to perpetuate Western dominance and American hegemony. The LIO is better understood as a core-periphery order because inequality between the Western-core and the \u2018Restern\u2019-periphery was constitutive of it. (Re-)Imperialism\u2014not just liberalism\u2014remained a central ordering mechanism well after 1945. I show the two-way deep contestations between the liberal and anticolonial ordering projects, especially at the 1955 Bandung Conference. Contra the post-LIO pessimism of disorder/chaos, I argue that the normative agency of the Southeast Asian states informed by the legacy of Bandung is heralding a multiplex, multi-regional world order. As the declining inequality between the West and Asia transforms the core-periphery LIO, the emergent decentered world order will lack a core, whether Western/liberal or Asian. This deep transformation should be welcomed, not deeply contested, although coexistence and global integration require embracing deep pluralism, not liberalism.\nManjeet S. Pardesi is Associate Professor of International Relations in the Political Science and International Relations Programme, and Asia Research Fellow at the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. His research interests include World Orders and World/Global History, Great Power Politics, Asian security, and the Sino-Indian rivalry.

A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz\n\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing.

Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 20% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions.

His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs.  He has worked extensively with schools both here and overseas supporting management and staff in the event of a suicide. He wrote the first suicide postvention guidelines for schools in 1990, developed the first national suicide prevention guidelines for schools in Australia in 1999 and reviewed and updated the NZ guidelines in 2010.\nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.

He brings to this workshop extensive experience in advising communities and government on post-disaster recovery in terms of both mental wellbeing promotion / community resiliency and suicide prevention.\nAs a Health Sociologist and Public Health practitioner, Barry has a long-term interest in the social and cultural determinants of wellbeing, especially the role of gender and he brings a wealth of knowledge and passion for promoting wellbeing in men. He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing.

However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages.

Along with festivals and shows up and down Aotearoa.\nHaving been retired since 2014, we\u2019re excited to announce that Minuit are back onstage for a limited number of reunion shows.\nThese reunion performances will pay tribute to classic tunes from all four albums 'The Boy with the Aubergine Hair', 'Except You', 'Fuji', 'Menace', \u2018Aotearoa\u2019, \u2018I Hate Guns\u2019, \u2018A Room Full of Cute\u2019, 'Last Night You Saw This Band', \u201825 Bucks\u2019 \u2013 everything gets a look in, plus a couple of other surprises.\nThe show will be supported by Western Haikus and JOLA BURNS.\nMinuit has a heart.

DON'T miss out!\nWHAT THE PRESS SAY..\n\u201cThe word Prodigy seems to entirely fall short of this soft-spoken young man\u2019s skills, he coaxes sounds and melodies out of his instrument that literally drop jaws.\u201d\nThe Calgary Herald, CANADA\n\n\u201cToday I saw the future of Folk \u2013 Festival goers flocking in the thousands towards the main stage to witness a young musical phenomenon from Australia dish out an absolute show-stopper.\u201d The Firefly Column, USA\n\n\u201cDaniel Champagne is a crossroads. Fusing the strong traditions of Blues, Folk and other roots art with pop showmanship and admirable lyrical ability. I firmly believe that he will become an ambassador for roots music in a time where it desperately needs representation.\u201d The Indie Blender, CANADA\n\n\u201creinventing roots guitar\u201d Rhythms Magazine, AUSTRALIA\u201cWatching Daniel Champagne perform is a once in a lifetime experience. He is a true prodigy that plays like no one else could possibly play unless they spent at least two lifetimes studying the art.\u201d BW Review, NEW ZEALAND\n\n\u201cDaniel Champagne exudes a natural ease on stage, as he sings poignant lyrics and beautifully crafted melodies that invariably whisk the heart up with grand romanticism. Coupled with an exhilarating guitar talent that transcends mere acoustic playing to replicate a whole band, Champagne is just magical\u201d Themusic.com.au, AUSTRALIA\n\n\"You feel as if he just invented the instrument yesterday and was discovering its possibilities afresh\u201d Ted Gioia (American jazz critic and music historian)",
