This exhibition will explore the tones, textures, composition and forms of the Chapel in black and white with many shades of grey.\n\"Generally, the older the equipment, the greater the personal input of the photographer is required and therefore the greater the commitment and individuality. Often, you can look at a 19th-century photograph and tell who the photographer is. You certainly can't do that today. It isn't only the camera and lens, but also the type of film (or in those days, glass plate), the developer used and how the print is made onto particular types of paper. Each gives a distinct interpretation\".\nJohn Grace - email - 18/06/25\nThe Trust looks forward to welcoming architects, designers, graduates, students and interested members of the public to attend this event and support the Trust in its work.\nThe Futuna Trust is a charitable organisation and all koha received from the exhibition events will go towards the ongoing care, maintenance and operation of Futuna Chapel and also to support various initiatives undertaken by the Trust.

    "description": "Auditions! Superior Donuts by Tracy Letts, Auditions! Superior Donuts by Tracy Letts\nStagecraft presents: \u201cSuperior Donuts\u201d\nBy Tracy Letts\nDirected by James Kiesel\n26 November \u2013 6 December 2025\n\n\u201cWhat could be more human, than to be scared, and keep it a secret.\u201d\n\nArthur Przybyszewski (that's (p)Shub-er-shef-ski), is the proprietor of a modest, behind-the-times donut shop in uptown Chicago. He can't seem to find joy in anything these days, not even the donuts he used to take such pride in making by hand. Vandals armed with spray paint, predatory landlords, and that nefarious Starbucks down the road all threaten to unceremoniously snuff out the only thing he's got left.\n\nThat is, until an upstart, ambitious young man shoulders his way into becoming a Superior Donuts employee, and an unlikely friendship (or is it a rivalry?) develops, inspiring both to face the demons they've been hiding from all this time.\n\nThis is a sharp-witted, heartfelt comedy by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts (\u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d) offering a warm and wry take on depression, diversity, and bravery that will leave you feeling all fluffy and sugary on the inside. Plus, who knows, you might get a donut!\n\nGo to the Stagecraft website to book your spot!\n\nhttps://www.stagecraft.co.nz/auditions\n\nAUDITIONS:\nAuditions will be on Saturday 13th & Sunday 14th September, with callbacks the evening of Monday 15th September.\n\nTo book an audition, please fill out the form by 10th September - we'll be in touch to confirm your audition date, time and location. If you have any questions please get in touch at .\n\nRoles (just try your best with accents, coaching available once casting is complete)\n\nArthur Przybyszewski [Male, Polish, 50s - 60s]\nThe owner and operator of Superior Donuts. Old, grumpy, and more than a little depressed. Secretly an artisan and a scholar, he\u2019s spent his whole life running from conflict. Until now? [Has a scene involving some violence]\n\nFranco Wicks [Male, African-American, 20s]\nYoung, idealistic, a little pushy, and full of attitude and energy. Franco believes that good things will happen to him despite all odds, and evidence, to the contrary. A former employee of Luther.\n\nMax [Male, Russian, 40s - 60s]\nOwner of the DVD shop next door, Max is interested in buying Superior Donuts to expand his (tiny) capitalist empire. Fancies himself a self-made man. [Speaks in a Russian accent, along with some dialogue in Russian]\n\nRandy [Female, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nRaised in the middle of 7 brothers and working as a cop in the Chicago Police Department, Randy\u2019s always been \u2018one of the boys\u2019. Big hockey fan. Has a soft spot for Arthur.\n\nJames [Male, African-American, 30s - 40s]\nAnother cop with the Chicago Police Department and Randy\u2019s beat partner. Well-respected in the community and [not so] secretly a giant Star Trek nerd. [Will consider any and all BIPOC actors for this role]\n\nLady [Female, Irish-American, 60s - 70s]\nLikely homeless and definitely a little hard-of-hearing, Lady is a well-known as a confusing-but-likeable, perhaps even mascot-like figure in the Uptown community. Well past the point of giving a crap about what other people think.\n\nLuther [Male, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nLocal bookie and crime-syndicate everyman, Luther has scratched out his living taking money from gambling addicts, which he finds troubling because he\u2019d like to consider himself a good, fair man. Has a stomach ulcer which is probably somehow representative of this inner conflict. [Has a scene involving some violence]\n\nKevin [Male, Irish, 20s]\nAnother of Luther\u2019s employees, Kevin\u2019s probably fallen into the wrong crowd as a young man, but it doesn\u2019t seem to trouble him that much. Seems to care mostly about getting paid and drinking Coca-Cola.\n\nKiril [Male, Russian, 20s - 30s]\nA shy man of few words (mostly \u2018hello\u2019), Kiril is an intimidating figure with a big soft heart beating beneath his tall muscular frame. Brought into the fold to be a construction worker and bodyguard, he\u2019s mostly interested in falling in love with the local bartender. [Most dialogue is in Russian]\n\n",

    "description": "Book Launch - South by South by Charles Ferrall, Join us to celebrate the publication of Charles Ferrall's South by South: New Zealand and the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The book will be launched by Harry Ricketts.\n\n- Thursday 18 September, 6pm\n- Unity Books Wellington\n- Free event \u2013 all welcome!\n\nJoseph Kinsey is not a name many of us know \u2013 or not as well as we know the name Robert Falcon Scott. But from his base in Christchurch, Kinsey \u2013 book and art collector, philanthropist, science enthusiast, businessman \u2013 forged deep connections with the Antarctic expeditions and the explorers themselves through his tireless work as the agent for various expeditions. Two other New Zealanders also formed close friendships: Charles Bowen, a former politician, and Wellington lawyer Leonard Tripp, to whom Shackleton declared: \u2018I love you as David and Jonathan loved.\u2019\n\nSouth by South tells the story of New Zealand\u2019s role in \u2018the Heroic Age\u2019, that wave of exploration beginning at the end of the nineteenth century in which men set out to traverse the continent of Antarctica and, if they survived, to bring home their findings. The members of this New Zealander triumvirate were all believers in the British Empire, but the southern voyages were to an uninhabited land.\n\nSouth by South brings to light many letters, newspaper articles, and pieces of official correspondence, much of which has not been published before, during the five expeditions of 1901\u20131916: the Discovery, Nimrod, Terra Nova, Aurora, and Endurance. In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship. What they and the explorers wrote was influenced by nineteenth-century adventure stories which conveyed the Imperialist ideals of the time. If the impending conflict of 1914\u201318 was a very \u2018literary war\u2019, this was a very literary exploration.\n\nCharles Ferrall is an associate professor at Te Herenga Waka\u2013Victoria University of Wellington. Among his books are Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics (2001); The Trials of Eric Mareo (2002), co-written with Rebecca Ellis; East by South: China in the Australasian Imagination (2006), co-edited with Paul Millar and Keren Smith; Juvenile Literature and British Society 1850\u20131950 (2009), co-written with Anna Jackson; Henry Lawson in New Zealand (2012); How We Remember: New Zealanders and the First World War (2014), co-edited with Harry Ricketts; and Remembering Gallipoli: Interviews with New Zealand Gallipoli Veterans (2015), co-edited with Christopher Pugsley.\n\nCover photograph: The ship Discovery leaving Lyttelton Harbour, 1901.

The book will be launched by Always Becominging.\nWednesday 3 September, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nAll welcome!\nWhat would he have wanted? As little fuss as possible. But, reading between the lines: a little help. All the latest gossip and complaints. An arse that is not wrong. Opulence. One leap from the rope ladder. The final word.\nIt\u2019s What He Would\u2019ve Wanted is the sixth book of poetry from the author of the acclaimed The Stupefying. In this hilarious and affecting new work, Nick Ascroft writes of lost friends, new frailties, new braveries, and being stuck in an organ pipe during a recital and not wanting to bother anyone about it. Yes, there are poems of cycling into dead-end utility holes but also poems of trembling resolve and arriving at work as aged as the night sky after completing the morning school drop-off. This is the best collection yet by one of the most exciting and mercurial poets writing in Aotearoa today.\nAbout the author:\nNick Ascroft is the author of five previous poetry collections with Te Herenga Waka University Press, most recently The Stupefying (2022) and Moral Sloth (2019). Living in Thorndon, he is a public servant and the president of Scrabble Wellington.\nCover design by Todd Atticus. ",

Shut her eyes. Rolled their names around her brain. Stacked each person in order like folded laundry, warm and crisp from the sun. She wondered how her name would sound amongst them.\n\nIn the rural reaches of Auckland, the women of the eclectic Gordon family gather for Christmas. They may push each other\u2019s buttons, but know precisely when to offer tea (or a tipple). Rita, the 50-year-old baby of the family, is planning to tell them she has cancer. Drifting between past and present, she considers the lives of women in their community and reckons with what it all means for her future and her family.\n\nFeaturing elderly lesbians, twins who aren\u2019t twins, and several dogs named Roger, Hoods Landing is about shoddy pasts, ambiguous futures and the imperfect bonds that tie family together.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nLaura Vincent (Ng\u0101ti M\u0101hanga, Ng\u0101puhi) is an author whose work spans fiction, poetry and food writing.

Why do 10-year-olds have to run cross country? What choice do I have? When is love staying, and when isn\u2019t it? At what age does a lamb become a sheep? Do you like it like that? Is it enough? How will I ever know if I\u2019m doing it right? What if I don\u2019t know it when I see it?\"\n\nFrancis Aschoff\u2019s debut poetry collection is a time machine trip from the heights of first love to the yellow days of infancy, from crying in club bathrooms to a future not yet known. These poems are a magnifying glass, a tender eye and a flame thrower. They are love poems to the difficulties of love \u2013 love that is absent or which can\u2019t be felt even when it\u2019s there. Spellbound zings with surprising images that will make you see, and feel, differently.\n\n\u2014\n\nPraise for Spellbound:\n\n\"These poems are beautiful like muscles moving under skin. Read them when you need to feel something. They will pick you up and toss you to the ground.\u201d - Always Becominging\n\n\"Spellbound is a feast of raw-hearted morsels. It\u2019s hot pink nostalgia with attachment issues. It\u2019s packed with feeling, sharp as teeth. It opens its mouth and consumes you.\u201d -Dani Yourukova\n\n\u2014\n\nAbout the author:\nFrancis Aschoff is a P\u0101keh\u0101, queer writer from Te Whanganui-a-Tara.

And after all that waiting, Nanna takes Peter on an exciting night time forest walk to find Ruru - in the dark!

This early version of the work offers the first glimpse into ideas that have been slowly unfolding since 2024. SEKI is a love letter to family and a meditation on survival, care, and maintenance.

His practice is deeply rooted in storytelling, endurance, and exploring the pursuit of utopia through movement.\nSHOW SYNOPSIS:\nSoon As I Get Home is a solo work celebrating life, death, nostalgia and preparation. It is a continuation of \u2018Isope\u2019s research into honouring the Pacific body. Soon As I Get Home questions what a graceful death looks like. Pacific people, especially Tongans, pour immense thought and care into mourning. \nThrough this work \u2018Isope asks - what does that process look like in a solo body? In my body?\nA body still young but that has endured. A body confident yet deeply insecure. A body that knows everything and nothing. A body obsessed with nostalgia but constantly evolving.

Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it\u2019s going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa.

Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it's going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa. Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you're a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show digs deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, family, and the undeniable need to keep moving\u2014no matter how creaky your knees may be.\n\nGet ready to laugh, reflect, and maybe even wince in recognition as GOMIL pedals its way across the country this spring. It\u2019s more than a show\u2014it\u2019s a celebration of growing older (and slightly wider) with humour, heart, and a healthy dose of spandex.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next chapter in this iconic Kiwi comedy saga. GOMIL is coming to a theatre near you - lycra, laughter and all.\n\n--\nFor accessibility seating information and wheelchair space bookings please email or call 04)9740535 during office hours.\n\n",

I moved to beautiful Aotearoa from Sweden a few years ago, and my journey with ceramics started in 2023 and I've been elbows deep in clay ever since. I use flora found all over the world, and outside my doorsteps, to shape my artwork. My ceramic pieces are all hand made and no piece will be the other alike. I mainly throw a shape on the wheel and then let it tell me what it wants to become.\nThis exhibition is guided by Ecclesiastes 3:1-11. I think life is beautiful in it's times of joy, but also in the times of struggle, where we can grow and learn.\nA Time for Everything\nThere is a time for everything,\nand a season for every activity under the heavens:\na time to be born and a time to die,\na time to plant and a time to uproot,\na time to kill and a time to heal,\na time to tear down and a time to build,\na time to weep and a time to laugh,\na time to mourn and a time to dance,\na time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,\na time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,\na time to search and a time to give up,\na time to keep and a time to throw away,\na time to tear and a time to mend,\na time to be silent and a time to speak,\na time to love and a time to hate,\na time for war and a time for peace.\nWhat do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.\n",

Through movement, multimedia, and razor-sharp wit, it examines the impossibility of perfect communication, musing on the influence of context, identity and personal history while creating something beautiful from our collective mess.\n\"Clever, witty, evocative, subversive, immersive, despairing, poignant, personal and universal\" \u2014 Deirdre Tarrant, Theatreview, 2024\n\"Beautifully vulnerable\" - Chloe Jaques, Theatreview, 2024\nFull of vigour, energy, chaos and a hint of confrontation, Manage Your Expectations is a mind (and body) bending show about how we connect in an increasingly complex world.

Nothing is ever so simple.\n\nThis genre-defying work of dance, theatre, live film, clown and absurd philosophising takes the idea of the \u2018trigger warning\u2019 to its absurdist extreme to question how \u2018informed\u2019 consent can really be, and asking \u2018How much do you really want to know?\u2019\n\nCreated and performed by multi-award-winning maverick of the stage Eliza Sanders, Manage Your Expectations helps us to see the limits of the power to communicate and our failures to say what we mean. Through movement, multimedia, and razor-sharp wit, it examines the impossibility of perfect communication, musing on the influence of context, identity and personal history while creating something beautiful from our collective mess.\n\n\u201cClever, witty, evocative, subversive, immersive, despairing, poignant, personal and universal\u201d \u2014 Deirdre Tarrant, Theatreview\n\n\u201cBeautifully vulnerable\u201d \u2013 Chloe Jaques, Theatreview, 2024\n\nFull of vigour, energy, chaos and a hint of confrontation, Manage Your Expectations is a mind (and body) bending show about how we connect in an increasingly complex world. And you decide the ending\u2026\n\nContent warning: this show contains explicit content, mild coarse language, heavy nudity, themes of abortion and rape.\n\nWINNER: Best Performer, Whang\u0101rei Fringe 2024\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance, NZ Fringe 2024\nWINNER: San Diego Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Best in Fringe, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Innovative Work, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Sydney Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Auckland Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Melbourne Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Adelaide Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Original Production, Wellington Theatre Awards 2024\n\nTues 16 \u2013 Sat 20 Sept 2025\nQ&A and Choose Your Price Night: Wed 17 Sept\nRelaxed Performance: Thurs 18 Sept\nCirca Two\nTues \u2013 Fri 7.30pm, Sat 20 Sept 2.00pm & 7.30pm\nShow Duration: 75 minutes no interval\nRecommended Age 16+",

    "description": "Messengers, \u2018Animals first entered the imagination as messengers and promises,\u2019 John Berger.\nMessengers explores the enduring gaze shared between humans and other animals. The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

Three mixed-race artists from across Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui \u2014 Carmel Aroha Salmanzadeh, Jessica Miku and Anthony Zemke \u2014 trace the echoes of matrilineal language and culture, reaching for words that live in their mothers\u2019 voices but not their own. The show speaks to the intricacies of love, loss, grief and gratitude. To inherit a tongue but not its fluency is to stand at the threshold of intimacy \u2014 close enough to hear it, yet unable to fully enter. At its heart are nine paintings that pursue a multifaceted visual language that expresses the artists\u2019 ability (or inability) to connect without language.\nTo love without saying \u201cI love you\u201d \u2013 \u201cka nui taku aroha ki a koe\u201d / \u201d\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0645\u201d / \u201c\u3044\u3064\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u201d\nAnthony Zemke (b. 1998, Aotearoa) is an Iranian-P\u0101keh\u0101 illustrator and painter based in T\u0101maki Makaurau.\nWorking within a conceptual framework guided by the Baha\u2019i teachings, Eastern mysticism, and Continental philosophy, Zemke\u2019s practice sees abstraction as the ideal vehicle for communicating psychosocial and spiritual realities. His works explore the boundaries of language, the dialectic of human oneness and diversity, and the various dimensions of radical compassion.\nCarmel Salmanzadeh (b. 2002, T\u0101maki Makaurau) is of M\u0101ori, Iranian, Samoan and Chinese descent. He uri t\u0113nei n\u014d Ng\u0101ti Hauaa, Waikato, Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti, Ng\u0101ti Ira me Ng\u0101ti Porou. Salmanzadeh traces links\nbetween the pictorial languages and motifs used in the traditional and indigenous practices of her multiethnic\nwhakapapa; exploring how visual narratives transcend cultural boundaries. Manifested in large-scale pieces, their works are influenced by the structure and design of Persian carpets, Samoan siapo and M\u0101ori taniko.\nJessica Miku (b. 2000, Whang\u0101rei) is a Japanese/P\u0101keh\u0101 artist based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Using the Japanese cultural anthropological concept Hare-Ke, which harmonises the fantastical with the mundane, they produce paintings of imagined female figures within ecological fantasy. These portals of otherworldliness are used to explore notions of tenderness\u2014in heart, soul, and flesh.\nPromotional Design by Tamara Irvine\nThis exhibition will be accompanied by a written work by Yue Pibrow ",

Unlikely. But do you have the WORST singing voice in the world? EQUALLY UNLIKELY. Your voice is probably average (at best), and at Pub Choir: we think that\u2019s great!\n\nNow in it\u2019s 8th year, Pub Choir is the easiest, funniest, largest music lesson in the world. Created and led by the human rubber band Astrid, be snapped into shape and flicked by her quick humour as she teaches everybody how to make a BRAND NEW PIECE OF ART TOGETHER.\n\nWhat will happen at the show? An entirely improvised, comedy music lesson, where you are the main attraction. Astrid will teach you one song (yep, just the one) in 3-part harmony, and you will do your best to follow her instructions and not to cry.\n\nGenerally, you should prepare yourself to learn something new and to not be a dickhead in public. But what should you specifically prepare? Nothing. It\u2019s not that kind of choir. There\u2019ll be no auditions and no homework. Just bring your mouth and we\u2019ll do the rest.\n\nSo come and bring your average-at-best self, and your average-at-best friends, and let\u2019s try to worry less and feel better. Also worth mentioning, Astrid wrote a book, and it\u2019s called Average At Best and signed copies will be available for pre-order purchase with Pub Choir tickets, to be collected at the show. Vocal health depending, Astrid plans to sit at the merch desk and sign these books after every show until her audience grows tired of her.\n\nThis show is 18+ Please be aware that this event will be filmed & photographed.

We'll close the day in the galleries, with a performance of photographer Ann Shelton\u2019s work The physical garden.\nOpen to photographers, curators, researchers, students, and anyone with an interest in photography, this event invites participants to connect, reflect, and share.\nTickets $60 (waged) / $40 (unwaged) with lunch included.\nAssisted listening\nAn assisted listening system is available for this event.

They trust each other, the audience, improv, and the moment to find their form. Nothing is decided beforehand.\n\nRich and Rebecca Sohn met as improvisers in Chicago over 30 years ago. As long-time teachers, this duo show began when former students asked them to headline a new evening of improv. Students often expressed surprise at how different their teaching styles were and took to saying \u201cyou\u2019re in the Sohn zone\u201d when seeing the couple work together.\n\nD.E.I.'s - Mo Munn & Ralph Hilaga\n\nWhen two besties land jobs at a prestigious company, they discover they\u2019re not there for their skills \u2014 they\u2019re the token hires. What follows is an improvised journey of chaos, corporate jargon, and an earnest attempt to prove they\u2019re more than just the diversity checkbox.\n\nFrom the chaotic minds of Wellington improv duo Mo and Ralph, D.E.I.\u2019s is a sharp, satirical, improvised workplace comedy about tokenism, identity, and the conundrums of modern day allyship.

Temporal Aria is a breathtaking contemporary circus experience that fuses the ancient art of hair suspension with acrobatics to explore the profound tension between control and surrender.\nInspired by performer Nicole Maisey\u2019s recent ADHD diagnosis, the show becomes a deeply personal exploration of distractibility, executive dysfunction, and the pursuit of inner peace. Through feats of extraordinary strength and vulnerability, Nicole transforms struggle into artistry, expressing a journey toward balance and self-acceptance.\nAt its heart, Temporal Aria is about learning to release control and accept support, a powerful shift from isolation to connection. As Nicole navigates the physical and emotional extremes of her art, she discovers that surrender is not weakness, but a pathway to strength, resilience, and unexpected grace.\nSet to a mesmerizing soundscape, Temporal Aria is both a spectacle and a meditation. a poetic intersection of circus, emotion, and identity. It\u2019s not just about the act of letting go, but about what we discover in the process: joy, contentment, and the redefinition of success as peace within.\nPrepare to be captivated by a performance that truly takes your breath away.\n\n",

Vignettes of characters similar to you, similar to me, similar to someone you may have been or may one day become, all on the path towards the Amber Temple.\nFrom the bowels of the molten earth, to the jowls of the predatory opportunist, to the angel casting light from celestial constellations, you will find yourself wrapped in a web from a sliver of time, a faraway place, perhaps an unknown space, as musician and dancer weave their tall tales of trials and tribulations, mortal life and looming death, unwavering love and venomous hate, environmentalism and satirical social commentary.\nAn original music and interpretive dance collaboration between singer-songwriter Julian Temple and contemporary dancer Amber Stephens.\nTemple, known mostly for his work in the eponymous Julian Temple Band has written all new works for the project while Stephens, a trained contemporary ballet dancer and choreographer who ran her own dance company in Vienna, has choreographed the interpretive dance for this unique performance.\n\u201cA live dancer added a visceral element to an already emotional performance. Having a responsive artist interacting and interpreting the music through movement only heightened the experience. It bridged the gap between performer and audience.\u201d\n- Ed Castelow - Dictaphone Blues\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be a converted fan of The Amber Temple before they\u2019ve even finished their first song. There\u2019s an obvious sense of originality, coupled with carefully crafted dance moments and some of the most intense and outstanding folk songwriting you\u2019ve heard. There\u2019s a feeling though that nothing is premeditated and that improvisation is the star of the show - the kind of performance that requires decades of experience. Luckily for us, Julian and Amber have this in spades. Do yourself a favour, I guarantee you\u2019ve seen nothing like it.\u201d\n- Sam Cullen - Singer/Songwriter\n\u201cEven having an understanding of the type of show The Amber Temple would be putting on when booking them - I was blown away by the amount of drama, tension and world-building Julian & Amber are able to accomplish in such an agile performance. The Amber Temple is a totally unique and utterly engaging experience which should be seen and celebrated.\u201d\n- Chris Scott - Seaside Music\nShow starts at 7 Presale tickets $20 (+BF) via undertheradar.co.nz or $25 on the door\n\"Vogelmorn Upstairs is not a wheelchair accessible building.

If we don\u2019t find them, they die with us.\u201d\nLondon. 1619. William Shakespeare has been gone for three years, and the other members of the King\u2019s men are starting to make their final exits. The remaining members of the company are horrified to realise that their dear friend\u2019s plays, the plays that they spent their lives bringing to life, are in danger of being lost to time. It\u2019s a mad scramble to find what copies they still have, fill in the blanks with their memories, claw back the rights to print from unscrupulous publishers, and find enough money to print a giant book in an era where the majority of people couldn\u2019t read. Without this labour of love, most of the works of a beloved playwright would have been lost to time.\nThis play is a celebration of theatre, a meditation on legacy, and a (mostly) true history of loyal friends.\nShakespeare is for everyone and London in the 17th century was not all white. The genders below are the gender the character will be played as, but don\u2019t let that limit you. While this play can be done with 10 actors, if you\u2019re new to the theatre and want to give it a go, there are smaller roles available.\nThere will be some moments of intimacy and physical affection between characters, such as hugs and other gestures of closeness, and a kiss or two between the married couples.\nCharacter Breakdown\n- Henry Condell (male, 40s - 50s) - Feisty, actor in the King's Men, the optimistic one (will\nnot double with any other role). Shares a kiss with Elizabeth.\n- John Heminges (male, 50s - 60s) - A good and serious gentleman, financial manager of\nthe King's Men, owner of the Globe Tap House, the reasonable one (will not double with\nany other role).

Forged by Black and Latinx trans women and queer communities, it began as a protest against the racism they faced from White counterparts within the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as the transphobia and queerphobia they faced from mainstream society.\nIt is a space held to protect trans women of colour. Therefore, guests and participants of this culture alike must uphold respect and honour for this sacred space and those from which it came from. Homophobia, transphobia, or any discriminatory language and/or beliefs will not be tolerated. Remember to check your privilege at the door.\nLearn more about the culture of Underground Ballroom on Google Arts and Culture.\nBe sure to check out the growing Wellington Ballroom scene and community by following @houseofmarama and @ova_collective on Instagram.

    "description": "The Life of Henry the Fifth, A young man, once revelling in freedom and reckless camaraderie, is thrust into the role of a king, burdened with the fate of England.\nVictory or ruin rests on his shoulders, yet his newfound power isolates him, leaving him lost, uncertain, and deeply unsettled.\nBetrayed by friends, mistrusted by his men, and taunted by those who seek his downfall, Henry\u2019s journey is both severe and profoundly relatable.\nShakespeare crafts a world where soldiers fight without knowing why, where the battlefield sees vagrants and children stand shoulder to shoulder, where uncertain rulers navigate a landscape devoid of guidance from the past. It is a world that, despite its historical setting, feels unnervingly close to our own.\nWith only ten dynamic performers, this is Henry the Fifth like never before: stripped back, sharp, and driven by the raw intensity of Shakespeare\u2019s text.\nExpect fast-paced storytelling, immersive staging, and a production that puts the audience at the heart of the battle.\nFull show duration: 95 min including a 15 min intermission.\n\u201cThis production epitomises what can be achieved when talent, teamwork, hard work, opportunity and passion combine.\u2019\u201d\nNZ Herald on The Tragedy of Macbeth ",

    "description": "The Monster in the Maze, The myth of the Minotaur is a tale almost as old as storytelling itself, but with The Monster in the Maze Jonathan Dove and Alisdair Middleton have excavated rich, new life from this classic. In this brand new staging by director Anapela Polataivao (Red White and Brass, Wild Dogs Under My Skirt), this story will be told as never before.\n\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he metes out his punishment in the cruellest way possible: by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth, to be fed to the terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze: the Minotaur. As King Minos triumphs, his great monster \u201cwill eat your future, it will rip your hope, it will stamp your youth, your children in the sand.\u201d\n\nAs the vindictive king will soon learn, however, these youth will not accept their fate without a fierce challenge. The Monster in the Maze is a story about resistance; about justice; about finding power not in oppression, but in collectivism. Fittingly, then, it\u2019s also a groundbreaking work in its form: a community-focused and community-driven opera in which young and community singers and players stand proudly shoulder-to-shoulder with their professional counterparts, and in which both are integral.\n\nThe Monster in the Maze has been roundly praised by audiences, participants and reviewers worldwide, and in its Aotearoa debut season, it will serve as a gorgeous articulation of New Zealand Opera\u2019s reciprocal community kaupapa.\n\nSung in English with surtitles.",

Register for a Zoom link: https://dia-nz.zoom.us/.../WN_gAVkcTdRRASW9zyDCrU4Zg...\nInsights from the John Scott architectural archive\nJoin us for a talk by Nick Bevin, former architect and Futuna Chapel Trustee, as he delves into the life and work of one of Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects \u2014 John Scott (1924\u20131992).\nThis presentation will showcase newly digitised materials from the John Scott Drawing Archive at the Alexander Turnbull Library, including never-before-seen sketches, architectural drawings, photographs, and audiovisual recordings.\nJohn Scott: Architect \u2014 Website\nDesigning the iconic Futuna chapel\nJohn Scott, a pioneering M\u0101ori architect, is celebrated for his bold, culturally resonant designs \u2014 most notably the iconic Futuna Chapel. Drawing on years of research, Nick Bevin will offer fresh insights into John Scott\u2019s creative process and enduring architectural legacy.\nThe Library welcomed the John Scott archive of architectural records into the Alexander Turnbull Library collections in 2020.\nCaring for the John Scott collection \u2014 Blog post: https://natlib.govt.nz/.../caring-for-the-john-scott...\nA Friends of the Turnbull Library event\nThe Friends of the Turnbull Library, Ng\u0101 Hoa o te Whare Pukapuka Turnbull, offers a monthly programme of free public talks.

He was drawn in by an early childhood memory, triggered by a black and white image of the opening of the Chapel on 19 March 1961, where he remembered accompanying his parents to the opening of the chapel. Since then he has developed a growing admiration for the chapel\u2019s architect John Scott, and was involved in the gifting process of the John Scott Drawing Archive to the Alexander Turnbull library in 2020.\nNick chaired the Chapel Trust from 2009 to 2024 and remains a trustee. With fellow trustee Greg O\u2019Brien, Nick co-edited the book Futuna \u2013 Life of a Building published in 2016. In 2024, Nick participated in the organisation of an exhibition at Futuna Chapel that included a number of John Scott\u2019s drawings from the Turnbull Collection.",

    "description": "Personal Brand Workshop | Wellington, Personal Brand Workshop Facilitated by Rochelle Moffitt\nWednesday 19th November 2025\n10am \u2013 4pm workshop\nThe rules of reputation are changing.\nToday, visibility, credibility, and connection aren't just nice-to-haves - they're non-negotiables. Even established industries and respected professionals are realising they need to evolve to stay relevant and competitive.\nThat\u2019s where this workshop comes in.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help you take ownership of your reputation, tell your story with clarity, and build a personal brand that feels like you - and works for you.\n\nWe know that the real shift starts inside.\nIt\u2019s not your LinkedIn. It\u2019s not the algorithm. It\u2019s the moment you believe you\u2019re worth being seen .\nThis isn\u2019t about performing or posting.\nIt\u2019s about owning your story, claiming your space, and stepping into what\u2019s next - with strategy and confidence.\n\nWhat This Workshop Is About:\nThis is not a social media crash course. It\u2019s a full-day, full-body recalibration of how you show up in the world - on purpose.\nWe\u2019ll use Rochelle\u2019s BANKABLE Framework to unpack what it really takes to:\nBuild a personal brand that opens doors and commands respect\nBecome the first name that comes to mind in rooms you haven\u2019t even entered yet\nBe strategically visible to the right people\nLet your reputation do the heavy lifting before you even show up\nUse social media to reinforce your authority, not just participate in the noise\nThis day is about shifting your mindset, sharpening your message, and building a brand that reflects your true value.\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Be BANKABLE?\nBankable means your name carries weight. You\u2019re trusted, referred, remembered, and respected.\n\nYou don\u2019t just do good work. You\u2019re seen as someone people want to work with, invest in, promote, or buy from.\nIt\u2019s not about being everywhere - it\u2019s about being in the right rooms, with the right presence, and the right message.\nIn this workshop, we\u2019ll break down the BANKABLE Framework, which is built on the 8 core traits of people who consistently attract opportunity:\nB \u2013 Belief\nIt starts with mindset. You believe you're worth being seen, heard, and valued. No shrinking.\nA \u2013 Authenticity\nLead with your real story, not a polished performance. People buy you, not your job title.\nN \u2013 Niche\nYou know what you stand for, who you serve, and why it matters.\nK \u2013 Knowledge\nYou share your experience and insights generously - not to impress, but to connect.\nA \u2013 Action\nYou show up. Consistently. You don\u2019t wait to be discovered - you make your value visible.\nB \u2013 Brand SignalsYour online presence aligns with how you want to be seen. There\u2019s clarity, not confusion.\nL \u2013 Leadership\nYou own your space. You influence through presence, not just position.\nE \u2013 Equity\nYou\u2019re building reputation, trust, and opportunity that compound over time. You\u2019re seen as a valuable asset, not just a contributor.\n\nWho It\u2019s For:\nAmbitious professionals, business owners, and leaders who are ready to:\nGet clear on what they stand for\nBuild trust before the first conversation\nShow up with authority and authenticity\nPosition themselves for the next opportunity, role, or revenue leap\n\nWhat You'll Walk Away With:\n\u2714 A mindset reset and brand strategy built using Rochelle\u2019s BANKABLE Framework\n\u2714 Your fully optimised LinkedIn profile that positions you clearly and credibly\n\u2714 A personalised workbook with brand messaging, positioning, and action steps\n\u2714 Clarity, direction, and the confidence to take up space\n\nExtra Perks:\nMorning tea, lunch, and afternoon tea are included\nInvestment:\nSpecial community rate: $1,600 + gst (limited to 10 people)\nIncludes all content, catering, workbook, and post-workshop support\n\nWhat Others Say:\n\n\u201cI walked into the Tickled Pink Bankable Brand workshop curious and walked out feeling like I\u2019d just plugged myself into a power socket. Rochelle has this rare ability to blend strategy with soul\u2026 I left with clarity, confidence, and that unmistakable \u2018I\u2019ve got this\u2019 energy.\u201d\n- Tash Fernandez\n\n\u201cI had hardly any social media presence, but Rochelle\u2019s tools gave me the confidence to start. I did my first LinkedIn post \u2014 it got amazing engagement! I now post with heart and confidence, without trying to perfect everything.\u201d\n- Karen Farr\n\n\u201cI was lucky to attend Rochelle\u2019s SHINE personal branding day and it was so good. I came away with WAY more confidence and a clear plan for LinkedIn. Also a great group of ladies and some really good laughs!\u201d\n- Dauniika\n\"Morning Rochelle! Just wanted to a say a huge thank you for your session yesterday, it was truly fantastic. We had some fantastic conversations surrounding your content throughout the rest of the day, everyone is talking on your challenge!\"\n- Westpac\n\n\u201cRochelle is an exceptional and fearless communicator who instantly captured the team\u2019s attention and pushed them to think far beyond their usual boundaries, inspiring immediate action. She skilfully took the time to focus on each team member, helping them uncover their unique online voice and personal brand. As a natural communicator and people builder, Rochelle seamlessly blends theory, data, and candid insights to empower everyone to believe in themselves, elevate their online presence, and embrace change with confidence.\u201d - Amber McKnight\n\"I attended a Tickled Pink personal branding workshop with Rochelle, and it truly shifted everything for me. It was like a lightbulb went off, and I realised that I am not just selling my company \u2013 I am selling myself. People want to work with me, not just Breitinger Consulting.\n\nBefore, no one knew what my business stood for, but after that workshop, I started showing up as myself, with my personality, skills, and experience. And then everything changed!\n\nMy LinkedIn and Facebook posts started to change, and I began attracting the right clients.\n\nMy posts gained engagement because they saw me, not just another person talking about financial and operational systems and processes, because I was so much more.\n\nIt made me more confident, helped me recognise my strengths, and made me think about who I really am, what my values are, and my mission. It even shaped how I see my personal future.\n\nWhen Rochelle offered the workshop during one of her Sip & Shares, I took the chance and booked it, even though it felt scary and I was not sure if I was financially ready. But it was so worth it. Do not wait until you think you are ready or have the money. By the time you think you are ready, everyone has already seen your stuff, and that is what they remember you for. So get it right from the start and make sure it is you they are seeing, from the beginning \u2728.\"\n- Manu Loths\n\"This completely reframed how I show up online. I\u2019m now getting better engagement, better opportunities, and I\u2019m confident about what I stand for.\"\n- Elise Dalrymple-Keast\n\"I had all these skills and passions, but didn\u2019t know how to bring them together. Rochelle helped me turn my experience into a message that connects. One of the most valuable days I\u2019ve spent on my professional growth.\"\n- Jodi Linder\n\nReady to become bankable?\nSecure your spot. Limited to 10 seats only. First in, first bankable!",

But since we're so busy in the doing, we don't often have the time or ability to take a full day off from work to dedicate to learning new things.... and sometimes conferences can be hit and miss on content.\nLast year we created a Leader Learning & Doing Day, where you can come and co-work in the same space as a bunch of other founders and leaders, and also go to mini unconference sessions during the day that are set by you. You share/learn/discuss the things that matter to you most - with other folk that are going through it. We had sessions ranging from how to use AI in your org, founder transitions, and even a photographer taking new head shots for folk. \nThe price of the ticket covers a koha to the venue and for some coffee/snacks. You can choose to come to all the sessions, or just one or two of them, and you'll have access to coffee and wifi throughout the day. \n\nBelow is our plan for the day:\n9:30am - Arrival & coffee\n9:45am - Welcome, Introduction round & Agenda Setting\n10:30am - Session 1\n11:30am - Session 2\n12:30pm - Lunch\n1:30pm - Session 3\n2:30pm - Farewell/head out for a drink (or home - you choose!)\nCo-hosts\nAnna Guenther - helps Kiwi fund the things they care about.

I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible.

ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!! This booking is for FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER\n                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cWithin the DNA is written not only our histories as individuals but the whole history of the human race \u2026 patterns of DNA that have come down to us virtually unchanged from our distant ancestors \u2013 ancestors who are no longer just an abstract entity but real people who lived in conditions very different from those we enjoy today, who survived them and brought up their children.\u201d ~ Bryan Sykes (The Seven Daughters of Eve)\nReturn to MAIN EXHIBITION WEBSITE - link coming soon",

    "description": "AI in Education: Part 1, Sovereign AI in NZ Education is a two part series that invites educators, AI developers, wh`\u0101nau, students, and other interested people to consider how we - in Aotearoa - can design, build, and use AI tools. The goal of these sessions is to spark and support the creation of AI tools and practices that best serve the aspirations of our students and wh\u0101nau, and blend well with the skills and insights of New Zealand's educators.\nPart 1:\nGenerative AI is already in Aotearoa\u2019s primary classrooms.  It is used by many teachers for planning and by \u0101konga both in and out of school.  However, policy, training, and culturally safe practice haven\u2019t always kept pace.\nIn this talk, David Coblentz will provide research-based insights into:\nteacher adoption patterns,\nwhat students say they\u2019re doing (and worrying about), and\nwhere schools are missing guidance.\nWe'll also discuss what AI sovereignty could mean in education in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nThen we can close with some practical steps for boards, leaders, kaiako, and wh\u0101nau to support constructive and equitable AI use in Years 5\u20138.\n*While the formal (and online) event will finish at 5pm, those attending in person are encouraged to stay on for snacks and drinks to share. Stay till 6pm or later, and get into the ideas more deeply, in a room full of good people.\nDavid Coblentz is a Senior Statistician at NZCER. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics, David holds advanced degrees in Biostatistics (MS), History (PhD), and International Studies (MA) from the University of Washington in Seattle. Prior to coming to NZCER and transitioning into an educational research career in 2021, David worked as a biostatistician, data analytics director, and statistical consultant. David also has university teaching experience in history. His areas of interest include data analysis and data science, history education, evaluation, and AI in education.\nPart 2 will follow within two weeks of David Coblentz's presentation. It will be an online event that features two or three local AI in education developers, talking about their current development projects.\nWe intend to record both parts and make them available via our community site - https://community.sovereignai.nz/",

    "description": "Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days, Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days\nThis workshop is ideal for advanced students who have already learned how to set cabochon stones. Over two three-hour sessions, 20 and 27 September, 10am-1pm, you will be given an understanding of the technique of setting faceted stones using a setting burr, hammers, punches and burnishing tools. This is the first step in learning to flush set facet cut stones so they sit below the surface of the metal.\n\nSession 1 will cover the technique, demonstrations and the basics of preparing and cutting the setting. Students will be shown how to set their stones, and may begin to do this in class, but will then go on to repeat and practice the technique in their own time.\nThey can do this at home, or for a small extra cost, can stay on at the studio to practice setting for the afternoon.\n\nSession 2 will pick up on the setting techniques, reminding and refining essential steps in the process. Troubleshooting can be covered in this class, as well as learning to clean up the settings. The principles of this setting technique will be covered in a few different scenarios, as some students may wish to take this skill into different styles or directions.\n\nThe option for students to have a half-day bench hire after class will also apply to this session.\n\nWhat is provided: class fees cover your practice metal (copper) and stones (CZ) and detailed handouts that are useful for you to take away to refer to when practising and honing your skills.\n\nCorrectly sized drills and setting burrs will be provided in class, but students must purchase their own burrs for practice after class and any future bench hires. These are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nWhat to bring: Advanced students can bring projects to set stones into, but please note the metal must be at least 2mm thick and we do not allow brass to be used as a project or practice for beginners. The metal must be copper or sterling silver.\n\nStudents should bring either a craft magnifier or magnifying lenses/glasses. If you have your own flex shaft tool you plan to use at home for drilling and setting, please also bring this along so that your tutor can advise on the best way to use it. We have two drilling machines in the studio, and these must be shared between the students, so if you have a machine, do bring it.\n\nPractice bench hire after class $20 per person (till 4pm) must be booked in advance.\n\nWorkshop fee $195, Early bird $175 till 24 August.\n\n",

    "description": "Bike Maintenance for Beginners, Gain the confidence and skills to maintain your bicycle in good working order, and to diagnose and fix some mechanical problems. Get familiar with bike terms and tools and learn through practical experience.\n\nHave you recently started riding a bike and want to make sure you can take care of it properly? Or have you been riding for ages, but have always been scared to fix anything yourself?\n\nAre you unsure of how to pump your tyres, or how much oil your chain needs? Find yourself fumbling for words when trying to describe that clunking sound to the guy in the bike shop?\n\nThis one day course lays bare the nuts and bolts of bicycle mechanics for absolute beginners, as well as those with a little experience. Through practical experience working with your own bicycle, you will find out what needs to be done to keep it running smoothly.

Regardless of whether your bike is in pristine condition, or desperately in need of TLC, it is welcome on the course \u2013 bikes showing a bit more wear can be useful for the learning of the whole group.\n\nBring your pushbike along on the day, If you have the following, please bring them as well: A multi-tool and pump; chain oil and rag; lightweight close-fitting gardening or rubber gloves.\n\n(Please note this course is not exhaustive and is not a professional training course).\n\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:\n- Name most parts of a bicycle correctly\n- Perform a quick safety check on any bicycle\n- Fix a flat tyre\n- Adjust your bike to fit your body\n- Oil and clean your chain\n- Identify and fix some common brake problems\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

Even if we wanted to take a deep enriching breath into the lower lobes of our lungs, we are limited due to our posture. Often due to the stresses and strains of a busy work and life balance, our unconscious brain can develop a pattern of holding, irregular and shadow breaths.\n\nDoes this sound like your experience?\n\nNot being able to breathe properly is the key cause of many chronic respiratory diseases (Nestor, 2020)\n\nCalligratherapy combines science journalist James Nestor's theory on proper breathing with the philosophy of ancient Chinese calligraphy to promote a state of optimal wellbeing.\n\nCalligratherapy has been developed specifically for those who have never practiced calligraphy before and who are interested in deriving the benefits without having to learn the language or all the characters. It integrates the simple and intuitive act of inhaling and exhaling into calligraphy practice with Eastern philosophy behind it.\n\nA range of different breathing exercises are embedded into each 90-minute session focusing on different calligraphy scripts. Over the five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing, while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nAll materials included in course fee.\n\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:\n\nStart a new creative practice in Chinese soft brush calligraphy\nDevelop your own mindfulness strategy\nBetter manage everyday stress levels and access a calm, empowered and positive state of mind\nFind ways to explore eastern philosophy and develop deeper connections with your spiritual self.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

Fresh from three weeks of intensive CI training in Thailand, Eliza returns with new wisdom and embodied understanding to share with our community.\n\nA Unique Learning Community\nThis workshop brings together an extraordinary learning environment where Footnote's four full-time dancers will practice alongside independent dancers and community participants, creating a rich exchange of distinct yet equally valuable body wisdoms. Together, we'll explore the multilayered practice of Contact Improvisation in its depth and complexity.\n\nThe Journey: Progressive Deepening Throughout the Week\nThrough structured explorations and guided improvisation, we'll delve into the physical practice while also discovering the connections between how we move together and how we navigate life with greater ease and joy. As is Eliza\u2019s style, we'll explore both the practical tools of the craft and uncover how this embodied practice offers insights for moving through the world with more presence and connection.\nWe'll venture into advanced techniques and principles of Contact Improvisation.

Good food. Good people. A real impact when it\u2019s needed most.\nCan You Stop at One? (We dare you!)\nA Sri Lankan cutlet is history disguised as a snack. European croquettes crash-landed on the island centuries ago, and Sri Lankans didn\u2019t just borrow the idea \u2014 they rewired it. Fish and potato for thrift, chilli and mustard seed for heat, curry leaf and lime for brightness, all sealed in breadcrumbs and fried in coconut oil. One bite tells you everything about the island: layered trade routes, colonial collisions, ingenuity in the kitchen, flavour turned into defiance. It\u2019s super-tasty \u2014 crisp, molten, impossible to stop at one. \nNow you get to make your own and learn a bit about Sri Lankan culture.\nWe\u2019re running a hands-on cutlet class where flavour is learned by instinct, not measuring spoons. You mix, taste, adjust, and chase that perfect balance of heat, comfort and citrus brightness. We bring every ingredient; you bring an appetite and the willingness to get your hands involved.\nWe\u2019re being hosted by the crew at The Beer Engine \u2014 and their Yuzu Hazy is the move. Bright and citrusy, it slices through the richness and wraps around the spice in a way that makes you sit back and swear under your breath. When the frying\u2019s done, we sit together and eat your creations with simple rice and Aiy\u014d dhal. Big flavour, cold beer, good people. The kind of night food lovers remember.\nFor any questions, please email kiaora@multiculturalcollective.nz",

    "description": "Dolores Mosquera Wellington New Zealand May 2026, Day 1 \u2013 May 10, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: Working with Dissociative Parts and Their Voices in Complex Trauma and Dissociative Disorders\nOverview:\nThis seminar focuses on adapting EMDR for individuals with dissociative disorders, using the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) Dolores has developed. It provides strategies for working with dissociative parts and their voices and integrating a trauma-informed approach to inner conflict safely from early treatment stages.\nKey Learning Points:\n\u00b7         Identifying and working with dissociative parts and their voices.\n\u00b7         Understanding the function and purpose of \u201chostile\u201d parts.\n\u00b7         Addressing dissociative phobias through EMDR informed techniques.\n\u00b7         Managing resistance and treatment impasses.\n\u00b7         Structuring work with dissociative parts effectively.\nProgram Description:\nAfter many early cautions about the potential dangers of using EMDR with individuals suffering from dissociative disorders, limited methods have been offered for adapting standard EMDR procedures to this specific population. Based on these early cautions, EMDR is still considered by many clinicians as limited to the treatment of traumatic memories in high-functioning dissociative clients and only after a long preparation phase that depends on other treatment modalities. Confined by this conceptualisation, the use of EMDR is too often limited, and many survivors of severe traumatisation are unable to benefit from EMDR reprocessing and, if at all, only much later in the treatment process.\nDolores Mosquera developed (with AnabelGonzalez, M.D.) the Progressive Approach model for treating complex trauma and dissociation (2012) and the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) (2019, 2025). Using this trauma and AIP-informed models, clinicians can safely utilise a wide range of EMDR interventions (including BLS) from early in the preparatory phase of treatment for patients with dissociative disorders.\nIn this seminar, she will present her current practice of working with clients, including video demonstrations. Mosquera's deft clinical skills and ground-breaking innovative thinking teach a middle ground between \"dissociation blind\" aggressive EMDR interventions and overly cautious delays to the use of EMDR reprocessing.\nMany dissociative clients have difficulty with hostile, critical voices. The internal conflict is sometimes so intense that the person even has difficulty carrying on an ordinary conversation. One factor that affects this conflict is how the patient deals with the voices or parts of the self.\nKey Program Content:\nIdentify the internal system of dissociation and internal voices that are hostile and critical\nHow to read the function and purpose behind the saboteur parts of self\nUsing compassion and understanding to help deal with dissociative phobias within the internal system\nSkills to reduce impasses and resistance that may complicate or reduce the efficacy of the treatment\nSpecific steps to organize the work with hostile parts and voices\n Days 2\u20133 \u2013 May 11\u201312, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: From Fragmentation to Integration: A Master Class in Treating Complex Trauma and Dissociation\nFormat: 2-Day Masterclass: Three Clinical Cases from Start to Finish\nAcross two days, Dolores will present three distinct new cases illustrating varying levels of dissociation \u2014 including one with frequent switching and no initial Adult Self. Each session is interactive, highlighting the therapeutic process from assessment to completion.\nOver two immersive days, this advanced master class offers a rare opportunity to observe and analyse complete therapeutic processes under the expert guidance of Dolores Mosquera.\n\nDolores will present three new and distinct clinical cases, each representing different manifestations of complex trauma and dissociation \u2014 including one client who experiences frequent switching and begins therapy without an integrated adult self.\nParticipants will follow these clients\u2019 journeys from the initial stages of therapy through to treatment completion, gaining deep insight into decision-making, pacing, and the integration of EMDR strategies within complex systems. The format is designed to be highly interactive and reflective, combining video demonstrations, live commentary, and group discussion to deepen understanding of safe, flexible, and attuned clinical practice when working with dissociative clients.\nThis master class is ideal for clinicians seeking to refine their skills, expand their conceptual framework, and enhance clinical confidence when navigating the challenges of trauma-related dissociation.\nAdditional Details\n\u00b7         Eligibility: Must have completed at least Part One of EMDR Basic Training (University of Otago or equivalent).\n\u00b7         Certification: Participants receive a Professional Development Certificate of Attendance.\n\u00b7         Dietary needs: Provided upon registration.\n\u00b7         Parking: Paid on-site parking available.\n\u00b7         Accommodation: Discounted rates at a local hotel (discount code to be posted on the event site).",

Participants will leave with practical strategies to challenge bias, strengthen team culture, and celebrate the richness of varied approaches in ECE settings.\nAutism NZ - Thecla Moffat\nMen can change the dynamics of play in ECE benefiting autistic tamariki\nMale kaiako often bring more energy in the ECE setting with an emphasis on more physical activity, outdoor play, \"rough and tumble\" play, and positive risk-taking, which appeals to both boys and girls and provides a different dimension to play than may be beneficial to most autistic tamariki. We now know that through fun and engaging interactions kaiako help enhance the autistic tamariki pivotal capacities for later learning. In this talk kaiako will get to know how men in ECE with their positive energy can make a difference through play for autistic tamariki in their centres. The kaiako will be given a few strategies of how to do that and some ideas to encourage tuakana-teina (peer play) between autistic tamariki and their non-autistic peers will be shared.",

    "description": "Financial Planning for Retirement, Financially successful people don\u2019t achieve their wealth by accident \u2013 they make and execute clear plans. Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

The panel will feature expert guest speakers from the International Science Council\u2019s (ISC) Committee for Freedom and Responsibility in Science.\nScience today faces many challenges: Scientific and academic freedoms are declining worldwide as anti-science ideology becomes imbedded in many of the world\u2019s governments; state obligations towards enabling science as a human right remain chronically ignored; irresponsible scientific conduct and governance of all kinds increasingly undermine science from within; and the tally of wars and crises which rob the world of the scientific talent held by entire nations is growing year by year.\nAt precisely the moment when scientific progress on some of the existential threats to humanity is most urgent, science itself is under more pressure than perhaps ever before. So, what can we do?\nAbout the ISC Committee for Freedom and Responsibility in Science:\nThe Committee monitors trends related to scientific and academic freedom globally, advises the ISC on official statements and positions, and advocates for the Principles of Freedom and Responsibility in Science. The Committee also engages in major projects at the intersection of science, human rights, and philosophy, such as the ISC\u2019s recent interpretation of The Right to Participate in and Benefit from Science.\nEvent details:\n5:40pm - Doors open\n6:00pm - Panel discussion\n7:15pm - Networking with drinks and canap\u00e9s till 8:15pm",

By integrating creative writing into your painting practice, you can enhance your imagination, storytelling abilities, emotional expression, attention to detail, and personal style on the canvas. Please bring along a journal or laptop.\n\nCOURSE CONTENT\nEach session presents a key idea backed by research or concrete examples, followed by practical writing exercises with optional sharing. We learn by doing and from each other.\n\n1. Generating work from the interior: tapping into memories, conflict, emotion, and observation to generate art.\n2. Figuring out what matters to you, then learning how to grow your fragmented ideas into something whole. For example, how do you turn a feeling, or a fleeting moment in time into a story? Into a painting? Into a work of art? What are the building blocks you need?\n3. Inspiration from other creative sources: people, music, poetry, reading, random incidents. Ways to generate fresh ideas. How to clarify and focus in writing and art.\n4. Structure and boundaries. Dreaming big but being real. How do you find and stick to a creative process?

You may work on a project incorporating your own ideas, or if you'd rather, an assigned a project from your tutor.\n\nYour tutor, Ross Payne, is a 30-year veteran of traditional 2D animation, and loves to share his knowledge about it for you to love it as much as he does.\n\nIn each lesson there will be examples and demonstrations of the animation principles with follow up exercises to put your new skills into practice. You'll work on your project both during class and at home, applying the animation principles to your individualised project.\n\nYou can choose to draw your animation on paper then scan/capture into your device, or choose to draw your animation digitally, directly into an animation programme. whichever you choose instructions in class will be provided to give you the skills needed for this step.\n\nYou can use any device, ipad or laptop you already own (except a mobile \u2013 it's really not big enough to do good animation on). The school does not provide any digital equipment. It's important that the app/programme is installed on the student's device before the course begins, and that they have had a play on it to get used to how it works. This is so that the student is at least a little familiar with their chosen software so that it's enough to begin learning animation techniques on day one. Additional information found at our website.\n\nRoss will advise you on a variety of animation apps/programmes available online to use, ranging in price from free to not very much. Note - A computer mouse can be used for 2D animation, but digital pens are much easier to use. Prior to the course commencing, you'll receive details of recommended programmes to use for the course.\n\nSuitable for a range of ages, from teens to adults.\n\nTuesday evenings, 14 October - 2 December, 6:30-8:30 pm",

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa. This annual public lecture series recognises the legacy of the late Dr Michael Volkerling who was one of the principal architects of New Zealand's cultural and creative sectors.",

    "description": "STEAMS School BLENHEIM Term 1 2026, STEAMS is an integrated approach to learning topics of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths, and Society that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. Its aim is to teach real world skills through engaging methods whilst allowing individuals to be creative. This involves immersing tamariki into projects and activities that develop innovation and champion curiosity. STEAMS is not \u2018play based learning\u2019 but focused learning through an integrated hands-on approach allowing children to take risks and explore their own curiosity in a subject without time barriers.\nAt the Ministry of Inspiration we offer STEAMS learning each term for Year 1-8 students. Once a week students will attend a class at Waterlea Racecourse, Blenheim on TUESDAY or THURSDAY. STEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) start at 9am and finish at 2:45pm on TUESDAY. Little STEAMerS operates from 9-12 on THURSDAY. STEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) operates on THURSDAY from 9am to 245 pm. \nInquiry, collaboration, and an emphasis on process-based learning are at the heart of the STEAM approach. Each term the classes will have a focus which drives the learning and our amazing teachers create opportunities to help each student develop their understanding, improve their skills and gain knowledge in a range of topics.\nStudents who participate in STEAM learning:\n\u00b7 think outside the box\n\u00b7 feel safe to express innovative and creative ideas\n\u00b7 feel comfortable doing hands-on learning\n\u00b7 take ownership over their learning\n\u00b7 work collaboratively with others\n\u00b7 understand the ways that science, maths, the arts, and technology work together\n\u00b7 become increasingly curious about the world around them and feel empowered to change it for the better.\nWhen does it meet, and where?\nThe school is held during school terms.\nSTEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) TUESDAY, 9-245.\nSTEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) THURSDAY, 9-245\nLittle STEAMerS (ages 5-6) THURSDAY 12-3.\nLocation:  Waterlea Racecourse, enter off of Linton St.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe students come for a paid three-week trial-as a new student you pay for that through Humanitix.\nIf both family and teacher feel there is a good fit for the child in the class, they continue for the rest of the term. You are then invoiced for the full term less the amount paid for the Trial.\nPayment is by term, with a cost of $73 incl. GST We have a limited number of scholarships available that are awarded on a term by term basis for those with financial need for 25% off. \nLittle STEAMerS is $30 incl. GST.\nWill my child\u2019s school mind that they miss a day per week?\nYou will need to inform the child\u2019s school that he or she will be at STEAMS School one day per week. To date we have not encountered any issues around accommodating a child\u2019s participation in STEAMS School, and many of the region\u2019s schools are very supportive of the programme. Once enrolled, you are encouraged to inform the teacher and office staff that your child should be marked present for the day they attend STEAMS School, as they will be attending an academic school as opposed to being absent due to illness or other reasons.",

Have fun making your own ring or perhaps a wonderful present for a loved one! The workshop runs from 10am - 4pm with a lunch break.\n\nStudents will practice making simple textured or polished rings in either copper or brass, then move onto making one or more silver rings from start to finish. They will learn measuring, texturing, soldering and finishing techniques to make beautiful, wearable rings!\n\nStudents can choose from creating textured, stamped or polished rings in flat metal, or adding in stacking rings in wire and bar. More experienced students may wish to make a wider ring, or a series of rings, perhaps in a tapered form or including finer details and finishing, or possible stone setting.

Course fee includes practice materials and 8g sterling silver. Extra materials are available to purchase in the workshop if time allows.

Brain has been passionate about photography for over 40 years, beginning his career at the National Film Unit in the 1970s before joining Park Road Post Production as Head of Laboratory, Head of Picture, and Restoration Manager. His work in film sparked an interest in early photographic techniques, prompting him to master wet-plate collodion photography. In 2006, he was invited to assist leading wet-plate experts in the USA and has since taught many New Zealanders this challenging process. Jane, who attended Brian\u2019s workshop in 2014, later married him in 2019 and completed a photographic project in Carterton in 2016.\nAlthough Brian retired in 2015, he returned for short-term assignments at Park Road Post and part-time work at Archive NZ, supporting film archiving until mid-2023.

    "description": "Why there are two biological sexes and what this doesn't mean, Arguments about the number of sexes have recently become heated, part of the culture wars of the twenty-first century. But what do biologists mean by male and female? The standard definition is surprisingly simple: male means making small gametes (sperm); female means making large gametes (eggs). Nevertheless, some biologists are unhappy with this view, arguing that dispensing with it would both lead to better science and support progressive social change.\nI argue, along with philosopher of biology Paul Griffiths, that such a move would be a grave scientific error. It would deprive biology of one of its most powerful tools for explaining biological diversity. I give several examples of the utility of the standard definition in evolutionary biology, such as an explanation for why there are, in fact, just two sexes, and how different characteristics become associated with different sexes in different species.\nI then identify some of the errors the critics make. Most notably, they assume that the scientific value of sexual categories depends on females sharing some essence of femaleness (and similarly for males). But this \u201cessentialist\u201d approach is rejected by evolutionary biologists, since it plays no role in the models that explain the evolution of sexes and sex-associated phenotypes. Moreover, the concept of biological sex is critical for understanding the evolution of the human reproductive system and why humans differ from other species.\nIt is important to realize that the standard definition of sex does not imply that there are just two sorts of (human) individuals. Because sex is different from \u201csex roles\u201d, gender and cultural practices, I also point out that biological sex is no constraint on human diversity.\nFinally, I note that keeping the standard biological definition of sex does not mean that (i) gender is binary, (ii) gender is biologically determined or (iii) scientists have not used sexist language and stereotypical concepts.\nIn short, this talk aims to help us to navigate a knotty problem of our time.\nBiography\nHamish Spencer is Emeritus Sesquicentennial Distinguished Professor in the Department of Zoology at the University of Otago. Educated at the University of Auckland and Harvard University, he has broad research interests ranging from modelling genetic changes in human, animal and plant populations to using molecular-genetic methods to study the evolution of flora and fauna. In collaboration with historians, he has written about eugenics, first-cousin marriage and Robert FitzRoy.\nIn 2009, Hamish was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand and in 2016 won the Society\u2019s Callaghan Medal for science communication. That same year he was appointed Science Advisor at MBIE, a position he held for five years. He was awarded a James Cook Research Fellowship by the Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi in 2022 and was elected a Fellow of the International Science Council in 2023.",

Krav Maga has proven to be highly empowering for women all around the world. We offer this course to women to learn to deal with women-related challenges, encouraging every woman to overcome anxiety or fear, with confidence, skills and strength.\nKrav Maga is a system that enables a smaller person to effectively disable a larger opponent. We will teach you how to utilise adrenalin and function under stress. It was created to be adaptable and easy to learn, regardless of your size. This makes Krav Maga perhaps the most suitable self-defence training for women today. Apart from the physical training, we will also train you to develop mental resilience, street tactics, confidence, positive self image, and empower you for life.\nIn an ideal world, women would not need to learn to protect themselves. However, until some deeply ingrained societal problems are resolved, it is smart and necessary to have some skills to be able to look after yourself and loved ones with. In the meantime, we encourage every women to approach this training with personal development, personal growth, enjoyment and empowerment being the motivating purpose.\nWe understand women often prefer to train in a women's class. This is our Women's (13+) class called ROAR.\nThese classes are about empowering you for life. Beginning in 2018, this program was created to provide a safe, holistic and supportive class where women can experience empowerment through our training. You will learn to find your voice, your confidence, your inner strength and resolve, while learning physical skills such as how to escape and overpower an assailant, counter grabs, abduction attempts, chokes, hair grabs, pushing and shoving, being hit, being pinned to the ground and sexual assault attempts. We will help you unleash your protective feminine fighting spirit\nThe Intro Night is the ideal time for women interested in the Women's Class to try a class first, see how we train, who we are, and gain some valuable basic skills, before deciding to join the full course. (Note: School Term 4, 2025 is 11 weeks long). No cost to attend the Intro Night.\nPlease email contact@tacticalsurvival.co.nz to enquire or book your spot.\nMore Info: www.tacticalsurvival.co.nz/womens\nAfter Intro, classes run every Wednesday night 7:00pm - 8:00pm (Thistle Hall Cuba St) ",

    "description": "You Spot It You Got It: Unpacking cultural conditioning and turning the mirror inwards, Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Pacific style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and effective insights. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from different communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from You Spot It, You Got It?\nIn You Spot It, You Got It, you will deepen self-awareness by being encouraged to recognise some of your own conditioning and impacts of this in your daily life/practices. When we are not conscious of the things that might not sit right within us then we unknowingly or knowingly project them onto others. What we reject, we project. By examining patterns and recognising our conditioning, then we can truly understand how we can live in more conscious ways. This Talanoa Tai learning experience offers space for talanoa, tools and exercises to facilitate introspection and personal growth by turning the mirror inwards.\nThis is a 3.5 hour in-person learning experience. The day will start with a mihi whakatau to welcome you into the space.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\nFacilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples.

    "description": "A Change Is Coming walk tour (Wellington Heritage Festival), A Change Is Coming walk tour (Wellington Heritage Festival)\n1pm, SUNDAY 19th OCTOBER 2025\n\n2025 marks the 40th anniversary of the introduction in 1985, of the Homosexual Law Reform bill. The bill set out to decriminalise homosexual activity between consenting adults and make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t the first attempt at homosexual law reform. Join us on this special 90-minute free walk tour to celebrate the people and movements that fought for a brighter future for rainbow communities.\n\nOur journey begins at the location of the first public meeting in New Zealand, advocating for homosexual law reform in 1967. This was two years before the Stonewall uprising in the U.S. which went on to ignite Gay Liberation around the world.\n\nThe tour ends at Parliament, where we honour the Members of Parliament who have championed equality over the last five decades.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll reflect on some of the difficult realities rainbow communities have faced, from the injustices of the legal system, to the stances of the medical profession, churches and the military. As the late activist Ralph Knowles recalls, \u201cAs far as medicine was concerned, it was sick. As far as the law was concerned, it was a crime. As far as the church was concerned, it was a sin.\u201d\n\nThough at times the stories are challenging, this walk tour is ultimately uplifting, as we pay tribute to our amazing rainbow kaumatua and allies who led the way.\n\nCOST: Free, but please register so we can manage the number of walkers: https://walktoursnz.wordpress.com/book/\n\nDATE/TIME: 1pm, Sunday 19th October 2025\n\nSTARTS: meet at the rugby sculpture, Jack Ilott Green, corner of Harris Street & Jervois Quay (just by Civic Square)\n\nENDS: Parliament grounds\n\nDURATION: 1 hour 30mins\n\nACCESSIBILITY: the tour is on flat public footpaths, with a light incline as we enter Parliament grounds. Tours are limited to approximately 20 walkers.\n\nThis tour is part of the amazing Wellington Heritage Festival - https://wellingtonheritagefestival.co.nz\n\n",

Come spark a new summer flame! \ud83d\udd25\n\nAuthentic Dating welcomes all men, women & non-binary people aged 18+, both monogamous & non-monogamous. We will aim to pair you with a gender different from your own.\n\n\nIs this event for me?\n\nIf you are seeking....\n\n\u2728 Deep & meaningful conversations without small talky chit-chat\n\n\u2728 Exciting new connections, both romantic & platonic\n\n\u2728 An opportunity to explore & challenge your assumptions\n\n\u2728 A substance-free environment\n\n\u2728 Playful & sincere communication activities\n\n\u2728 Skills you can apply to your dating life beyond the event\n\n\u2728 A space to simply be yourself\n\n....then this event is for you!\n\n\nWhat will actually happen? \ud83e\udd70\n\nYou will be invited to explore four unique interactions, some of which are randomised and some of which you can choose. Each will involve a new set of instructions to help you communicate about topics that really matter to you.\n\nEach interaction will last 10-15 minutes. At the end of each interaction, you will have the opportunity to share a contact detail on a piece of paper in a way that is both cute and discrete ~ please bring your own pen!\n\nConsent is important: you always have the agency to choose how deep you go. You will never be forced to share information that you don't want to.\n\n\nWhy are tickets sold by gender? \ud83d\udc6b\n\nTo ensure that the gender balance is as even as possible, it is important to keep track of how many men/women/non-binary people are signing up. If a particular gender is over-represented in the run-up to the event, we do our best to ensure that under-represented gender(s) also sign up.\n\nWhile we aim to achieve an even balance of genders (and ages), this is not always possible. However, what is guaranteed are skills that you can apply to any connection. Simply come with an open mind and ready to connect.\n\n\nThe facilitator \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nLaurie King\n\nI'm Laurie (he/him), a queer British-Kiwi who\u2019s current home-base is Berlin.

Join us to hear him talk about the books that have shaped his life at this special fundraising event for Katherine Mansfield House & Garden.\nAfter anchoring Newshub's 6pm bulletin for 20 years and reporting from conflict zones and natural disasters worldwide, Mike is a familiar face in New Zealand homes. His work involves telling other people\u2019s stories, but what stories have influenced him? Books have played an important role in Mike\u2019s life, taking him from student librarian to author of two books himself.\nMike\u2019s latest book, 'Speaking My Language | Te K\u014drero i T\u014dku Reo', explores his deeply personal journey into Te Reo M\u0101ori and Te Ao M\u0101ori - captured in his acclaimed documentary, 'Kia Ora, Good Evening'.\nThe evening will begin with a glass of Hunter\u2019s Wines\u2019 award-winning MiruMiru\u2122 and delicious canap\u00e9s.

    "description": "Book Group: The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky, Do you keep meaning to read more of the great classics of literature? At Wellington Classic Literature Club, we read novels that have stood the test of time, whether they were written in 1780, 1880 or even 1980. We meet on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nWe return to Russia for our long summer read! The group's first-ever summer book was Anna Karenina, and we read Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov over the 2018/19 summer. (We were also due to discuss his novel Crime and Punishment, but that was set down for April 2020 and, well, the world had other plans\u2026)\n\nThis year, we read another of Fyodor Dostoevsky's masterworks: The Idiot, which was initially published as a serial in 1868-1869. Dostoevsky scholar Joseph Frank said The Idiot \"is the most personal of all his major works, the book in which he embodies his most intimate, cherished, and sacred convictions.\"\n\nThe story revolves around Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin, a young man returning to Russia after spending several years in a Swiss sanatorium for epilepsy. Dostoevsky had set out to create a protagonist with \"a truly beautiful soul\" and to trace the fate of such an individual as he comes into contact with the brutal reality of contemporary society.\n\nRSVP\nIf you use Facebook, you can RSVP to the event on our Facebook page (above) - it really helps us keep track of numbers. Otherwise, just come along...\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place. After you enter the bar, head to your right (up the step) and through a smaller space with booths to the large carpeted space beyond.\n\nABOUT US\nWellington Classic Literature Club has been running for more than a decade - since the start of 2013 - and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers who come along for particular books or simply when it suits.

    "description": "Colossal Squid: Freaky Features, Colossal Squid: Freaky Features comes to Cobblestones, Greytown\n\nThe ever-popular Te Papa exhibition Colossal Squid Ngu Tipua opens at Cobblestones on 11th December 2025 and runs through until 1st February 2026.\n\nThe Colossal Squid is so rarely seen that only eight adult colossal squid have ever been scientifically reported. Now venue name, in co-operation with Te Papa, is set to reveal some of the fascinating science and wonderful secrets of one of New Zealand\u2019s most significant natural history specimens.\n\nTe Papa's Head of Natural History, Phil Edgar, said, \u201cIn learning about this weird and mysterious creature, we hope visitors will have a greater appreciation for life in the deep sea, much of which remains undiscovered.\u201d\n\nThe Colossal Squid is one of the most iconic specimens at Te Papa, and while touring the complete specimen is impossible, some of the important parts of the squid have found their way to Cobblestones.\nTe Papa\u2019s Curator of Invertebrates, Dr Rodrigo Salvador, explains how important the Colossal Squid has been for the science community, and how popular it has been among the public.\n\n\u201cTe Papa\u2019s Colossal Squid has been a major source of information for scientists and the museum\u2019s most popular exhibit since its debut. They live in the deep Antarctic waters, and despite being one of the largest invertebrate species in existence, they are very rarely captured\u201d.\n\nColossal Squid Ngu Tipua centres around an interactive table displaying many different objects, including the lens from an eye of the Colossal Squid, part of a tentacle, and a complete tiny squid, a miniature of its colossal relative. Touchable rotating models of a squid\u2019s tentacle hook and the Colossal Squid's beak are also on display.\n\nThe exhibition also displays two documentaries which show life in the depths of the Southern Ocean, and how the most complete Colossal Squid ever found ended up at Te Papa.\n\nThe public can continue the experience and learn beyond the exhibition with a new Te Papa press book for children, Whiti: Colossal Squid of the Deep, and online Te Papa resources, including a free downloadable Colossal Squid Activity Book.\n\n\u201cThanks to the support of WBS and Te Papa, Cobblestones is delighted to be bringing this fascinating exhibition to Wairarapa during the summer holidays. It\u2019s a must-see exhibition for the young and young at heart to learn about this fascinating creature, its world, and habitat.\u201d\n\nColossal Squid Ngu Tipua is developed and toured by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\nCobblestones Museum - 063049687 or cobblestonesmuseumgreytown@gmail.com",

Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day.

A newly opened countryside caf\u00e9, spoiling with on-site baking, offers a pause looking out towards the Tararua range. A barbecue in a bucolic Waiohine setting. A f\u00eate, nostalgically redolent of yesteryear, selling perennials, crafts and home produce. There will be Devonshire cream teas and Wairarapa Ros\u00e9 and bubbly, bunting, adventure and indulgence. How could you resist?\nThe houses are further flung than the previous tour and we listened hard to feedback \u2013 fewer destinations but greater distances will mean you\u2019ll more comfortably explore this charming town and it\u2019s houses and gardens.\nYou\u2019re invited to spend a summer\u2019s day exploring remarkable houses and gardens in this attractive town. In so doing you will contribute to a fundraiser for the refurbishment of Greytown's colonial-settler K\u014duka Cottage (c1860) at Stella Bull Park, 113 Main Street, Greytown.

Photographs are available on the Greytown Heritage Trust\u2019s media sites and we ask that you don\u2019t take your own photographs inside houses, nor touch furnishings or items. Some areas will be inaccessible and signed accordingly. Some gardens may also be off limits for photography but this will be indicated at the venue.\nKeeping people and property safe is important, this tour is reserved for those aged over 15. We\u2019re also asking that no animals are brought to the visits unless they are mobility-trained and certified. Accessibility is compromised variously in houses and some gardens.\nGreytown public toilets will be marked on the map.\nThe tour will proceed regardless of rain or other moderately poor weather but there may be a cancellation in the event of Met Office amber or red warnings. In this, what we hope is unlikely, event we will communicate with you by email and on social media sites.\nCash sales and some eftpos facilities will be available at some properties. The proceeds or proportions of these sales will also contribute to the fundraiser.\nThe Trust is grateful for your support, and wish you a wonderful day exploring and enjoying Greytown\u2019s heritage properties.\nLinks\nWebsite (for more heritage info):\nhttps://www.greytownheritagetrust.co.nz/\nSocial Media (for sneak peaks of the tour):\nhttps://www.instagram.com/greytownheritagetrust/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/greytownheritagetrust",

We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event that alcohol is not permitted. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve ( https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page. The less cars driving the better.\nFeel free to share the event page and send an event invite to whomever you feel would be interested, not everyone sees the notifications and advertising",

John Campbell highlights some consistent themes of Brian Tamaki's Destiny Church: far-right prejudices, manifest anger, and hatred.\nIn Auckland on 21 June, Destiny Church organised a march to take \"a bold public stand for Christian values, Kiwi identity and the future of this nation\".\nOn Saturday, 13 September, Brian Tamaki attended the London \u201cUnite the Kingdom\u201d protest organised by far-right political activist Tommy Robinson that claimed to celebrate 'free speech', but also contained chants of hate, racist conspiracy theories, and Christian nationalist slogans. Among disturbing scenes, some people in the crowd ripped up a flag that read 'Secular Humanism'. To them, the very idea that people of all backgrounds and beliefs can live together with equality and respect is something to fear and destroy. For decades, the far right in the USA has painted humanism as a bogeyman, blaming it for liberal values, the rights of women, and the rights of LGBT people. It shows that those who thrive on fear are deliberately targeting the very values that underpin human rights and human dignity. Humanism is not a fringe or \u2018woke\u2019 idea. It is about fairness. It is about reason. It is about believing in the good that people are capable of when they are free to live their lives without fear or prejudice. These protests, which Brian Tamaki is supporting, are a show of force from those who wish to undo progress, to divide communities, and to undermine cherished freedoms.\nWe have a growing concern for secular values in our community. We cannot be silent. It is essential to keep compassion alive in public life and politics. After watching the documentary, we will discuss our concerns and how we might respond.\nTime: Oct 6, 2025 06:30 PM Auckland, Wellington\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/88183700512...\n",

Over 10 years many people from all walks of life have joined and participated, adding to the collective co-creation. Each and every one has made this gathering what it is! We'd like to thank you all and to extend an invitation for a potluck-style birthday celebration from 5pm on Wednesday 5th of November, with Bday cake and lighting the fire at around 7pm. Come along, everyone is welcome!\nIf this is your first time, make sure to read the full event description bellow:\nFull Moon Drumming Wellington is a registered public event with the Wellington City Council. We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Driftwood from nearby south coast beaches is often abundant, feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page.

We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Driftwood from nearby south coast beaches is often abundant, feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page. The less cars driving the better.\nFeel free to share the event page and send an event invite to whomever you feel would be interested, not everyone sees the notifications and advertising ",

Since then, ballroom has taken over the world with scenes in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania.\nThe Aotearoa Ballroom scene was ignited by M\u0101ori and MVPFAFF+ youth in T\u0101maki Makaurau over 10 years ago, and has since inspired other leaders across the motu to forge their own Ballroom communities in their respective cities. \nIn preparation for The Grand Kiki House of Marama Ball, hear from influential figures who have made significant contributions to their own scenes. With international Icons and Legends coming to Aotearoa for the first time, there has never been a better time to learn and enhance our own knowledge and experience of Ballroom. \nFeaturing ballroom leaders Arturo Mulan (NYC, USA), Matyouz Royalty (Paris, EU), Jaycee Iman (Auckland, NZ), Karamera Marama and Rom\u00e9 Marama.\nPanellists\nIcon Arturo Mulan (NYC Father of the International House of Miyake-Mugler) (he/him) is a ballroom Icon and Legend from the beating heart of Ballroom, NYC.

    "description": "RETHINK Fundraising Wellington 2026, INTRODUCING AOTEAROA'S NEWEST FUNDRAISING EVENT: RETHINK\nRETHINK Fundraising 2026 invites you and your team to look at your fundraising programme from a fresh perspective.\nJoin us for a full day of inspirational talks, panel discussions and practical workshops that will leave you energised, AND armed with a toolkit of actionable learnings to take your fundraising to the next level.\nDate: Thursday, 5 March\nVenue: M\u0101karo Room, Wharewaka Function Centre\nTime: 8am-5pm\nCost: $249NZD (exc GST)*\nContact: Anna Shere anna@changeand.co\n*If you prefer to pay via invoice, please email accounts@changeand.co.\nTHE PROGRAM\nFor those of you who joined us for RETHINK Auckland 2025, please note that RETHINK Wellington will feature many of the same sessions from that event, with a few additions to the program and two new guest speakers.\nBranding blindspots \nIn a sector focused on campaigns, conversion, and compliance, brand is often overlooked. But brand isn\u2019t just a logo or a nice story. It\u2019s how people feel about supporting you. And if it's not clear, engaging, or modern \u2013 you\u2019re leaving both money and meaning on the table. This presentation from Tim Dove at re:brand will challenge a few norms and show some examples of it being done well. He\u2019ll get you thinking about your organisation and how you can ensure you\u2019re avoiding the \u2018brand blindspot\u2019. \nRethinking charity comms \nWhen it comes to getting people enthused about our cause, too often we focus on the what rather than the why. Worse, we risk boring our audience to death with earnest, organisation-centric communications which neither inspire nor instruct. Dominique Antarakis from Change&Co will show you a new and fun way to look at your charity comms for maximum engagement and donor retention.  \nWorkshop 1 \nFacilitated workshop which will provide the opportunity to take the learnings from the morning sessions and give you the practical branding and comms tools to take back to your organisation - and transform your fundraising! \nLunch break  \nTake a break, mix and mingle, and enjoy a fabulous lunch selection.\nData, behaviour, and hyper-personalisation \nThis presentation from MIMO/DATAM will show you how to transform raw data into meaningful, multi-channel interactions across email, SMS, voice, and direct mail - all from a single platform. This session will challenge how you think about personalisation - it\u2019s not just about names in subject lines or open rates in eDMs, it\u2019s about burning down the old school campaigns and rebuilding around behaviour, context and connection. \nLessons from the legacy frontlines \nBased on interviews with practitioners from organisations large and small, this session shares unfiltered insights from Gift in Will managers who are doing the work every day\u2014what's actually generating pledges, where they're getting stuck, and what they wish they'd known sooner. Through their collective wisdom, and guided by TEDIREX\u2019s Martin Ruane, we'll explore the biggest challenges facing legacy programs today, the opportunities hiding in plain sight, and tactical takeaways that work for both beginners and experienced practitioners. \nWorkshop 2 \nFacilitated workshop which will provide the opportunity to take the learnings from the afternoon sessions and give you the practical personalisation and AI tools to ramp up acquisition and retention.  \nCFRE ACCREDITATION\nFull participation in RETHINK Fundraising is applicable for 7 points in Category 1.B -Education of the CFRE International application for initial certification and/or recertification.\nEVENT PARTNERS\nChange&Co, DATAM, mimo, re:brand and Tedirex. Special thanks to FIA/FINZ for their support of the day.\nRETHINK has been designed by fundraisers for fundraisers, and we\u2019re keen to make sure you get the most out of the day. We promise no hard-sell, no product placement, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee.\nThe idea is for you to leave at the end of the day with a roadmap to greater donor engagement \u2013 and a sense of renewed energy for what lies ahead.",

We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Driftwood from nearby south coast beaches is often abundant, feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page.

    "description": "The Stories of Our Bodies Wellington [LGBTQIA+ cohort], We often believe we can know something about other people based on what we see of their bodies. Before we\u2019re even conscious of it, we label, compartmentalise or judge - and it can be a real struggle to relish our own bodies when this judgment happens in front of a mirror. \nThe Stories of Our Bodies is an affirming and liberating circle, firmly\nheld in dignity, that redirects this judgement towards positive body image and bodily autonomy. This workshop builds on the living lineage of Australian Radical Faerie elder Uncle Teacosy. It is shaped from gay men\u2019s survival of the 90\u2019s AIDS epidemic, evolved to uplift queer&trans communities and has been offered internationally by only one facilitator.\nEach participant is invited into deep connection with their body and then in turn, we share the stories of our bodies from birth til now, removing as many articles of clothing as we choose. Stories often include histories of illness, injury, gender affirmation, addiction, aging, intentional modification, shape, ability or size\nWhat stories can the marks and folds of a body tell when witnessed in belonging and respect? How can we uplift each story and every storyteller?\nThis circle is for participants from the Takat\u0101pui, MVPFAFF+, LGBTQIA+ communities, active in engaged consent and includes partial or full nudity in a non-sexual atmosphere.\nYour Facilitators: Eleven Greenstones and val smith\nEleven Greenstones (she/they, Pakeha) is a cultural worker, community educator, researcher, gardener and facilitator who seeks deep and fertile justice by cultivating rich soil and robust, adaptive communities. For three decades, Eleven has informed and performed behind a radio desk, on stage, in community centres and cultural hubs. Her work spans the Pacific Ocean including in Aotearoa, Australia, Timor Leste, China, Korea, Mongolia and the US: educating in high schools, AOD rehabs, hospitals, police stations, co-housing cooperatives, squatted warehouses, international language schools and mentoring in arts workshops and community gardens.\nEleven is a life-long student, recently in decolonial Fieldwork with Leah Manaema Avene and with H\u00e9ctor Aristiz\u00e1bal, founder of ImaginAction. They\u2019ve studied post-activism with fugitive philosopher Bayo Akomolafe, Generative Somatics and Undoing Racism\u00ae (People\u2019s Institute for Survival and Beyond). They\u2019ve been mentored by First Nations ecologists to work for a living planet, Undoing White Supremacy Austin (Texas) to design and deliver anti-racism \u2018unlearning circles\u2019 and by Radial Faerie elders to facilitate liberating spaces for the LGBTQIA+ community.\nval smith (P\u0101keh\u0101, they/them) is a choreographic artist-researcher and educator based in T\u0101maki Makaurau, Aotearoa.

    "description": "Towards modernism: The Walter Cook collection at Te Papa, Towards modernism: The Walter Cook collection at Te Papa\nCurator and author Justine Olsen will explore Te Papa\u2019s Walter C. Cook Collection of Decorative Arts. Walter intended to trace modernism\u2019s roots from the Arts and Crafts Movement to post-war designbut, but how did he achieve this aim?\n\nJoin us at the Library or online. Register for a Zoom link:\n\nModernism through the eyes of a collector\nBetween 1965 and 1990, collector Walter Cook built up an extensive collection of British and European decorative arts, mostly purchased in Wellington. In 1992 he gifted the collection to Te Papa, significantly adding to the museum\u2019s holdings of international decorative arts.\n\nIn the research for her book, Towards Modernism: The Walter Cook Collection at Te Papa, Justine Olsen drew on Turnbull and National Library collections, including the Wises Street Directories and Papers Past, to understand market trends through the flow of design from Europe to the market in New Zealand.\n\nIn this talk, Justine will explore the story of the market and changing taste, both at the time of production and half a century later, when these objects were sought after by dealers and collectors.\n\nThe Walter C. Cook Collection of Decorative Arts\nThe collection was built up over a twenty-five-year period by Walter Cook, a discerning and determined collector of modest means. The glass, ceramic, and metal objects \u2014 by designers including Susie Cooper, Clarice Cliff, William De Morgan, Christopher Dresser, and Inge-Lise Koefoed \u2014 track the evolution of design from the Arts and Crafts movement through to the British and European modernism of the 1970s.\n\nA Friends of the Turnbull Library event\nThe Friends of the Turnbull Library, Ng\u0101 Hoa o te Whare Pukapuka Turnbull, offers a monthly programme of free public talks. These talks are held in the National Library in Wellington and on Zoom. Some of these talks will be repeated in Auckland. The public programme highlights the work of researchers who draw on Turnbull material for their projects and staff who care for and research the collections.\n\nAbout the speaker\nJustine Olsen has been Curator of Decorative Art and Design at Te Papa Tongarewa the Museum of New Zealand, since 2009. Her special interests include late nineteenth and twentieth century design, and contemporary New Zealand craft especially ceramics and jewellery. With history curator Michael Fitzgerald, she developed the exhibition \u2018Walter Cook: a collector\u2019s quest\u2019 in 2012.\n\nImage: Justine Olsen, author of The Walter Cook Collection at Te Papa.\n\n",

    "description": "Tram 17 Inauguration (Fathers Day 2025), Join us at the Wellington Tramway Museum as we put our latest restoration project into active service at the museum!\nTram 17 was built in 1904 by the Wellington City Council Tramways as a four wheeled box (Palace) style tram. By 1917 the system had grown and 17 was rebuilt into its current form adding a set of trucks converting the tram to 8 wheels. Tram tram saw regular service until the 1940\u2019s where it was eventually use for peak time travel, before being withdrawn in the late 50\u2019s.\nIt was then sold, and taken to Bell road in Raumati on the Kapiti coast where it served as a beach hutt until the 80\u2019s where it was donated to the Wellington tramway museum for display and eventual restoration.\n2014 a conservation and restoration plan was put together, and the tram was shipped out to the Wheelwright Shop in the Wairarapa for a full body overhaul. It was transported back to the museum in 2017 and put on public display until new trucks (wheelsets) could be manufacturedby A&G price in Thames.\nSince 2019 the tram has undergone new wiring, and extensive testing and running in and is now ready to take passengers along our museum.\nTram 17 is a wonderful achievement by all\nThose involved, and we cannot wait to welcome you this Father\u2019s Day to enjoy a ride on this heritage tram, saved from the scrap heap, and then saved again from rotting away.\nPlease note: We intend to run tram 17, however due to the nature and style of the tram, its operation is weather dependent. If we deem that the tram cannot run, we will advise accordingly. ",

    "description": "Cashmere Reserve mini-bioblitz, I'll be at the reserve from around 8.15am until around 10am. If you want to take a look at a small wetland and forest undergoing restoration, and record a few iNaturalist observations, then come along and say hi. Make your way to the back of the grassy area and you'll see where the restoration work is underway. There's no track but you can get some distance following the stream and it's really stunning further up.\nImportant information: there's almost no selaginella in the reserve, so if you've been in reserves where it's rampant, you might want to clean your boots. Also, it's important to stay out of unweeded parts of the wetland, apart from the streamside area. There's tradescantia in there and trampling will make it more difficult to control in future.\nCashmere Reserve is a dog exercise area and I'll have my dog with me. She's very friendly with people but is a bit grumpy with other dogs, so if you are bringing a dog with you, give me a call when you arrive and I'll put her on leash. 0210 8355 915 ",

    "description": "Challenges in a Changing World \u2013 what kind of future do we want?, Public Talk & Workshop\n\nHumanity is at crossroads\nOne path into the future leads to increasing social and economic division, environmental destruction, war and planetary peril. The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, a golden era of peace.\n\nThroughout history, especially at times of crisis, great spiritual teachers have emerged to show humanity the next step forward.\n\nAccording to British artist, author and esotericist Benjamin Creme, a group of such spiritual teachers is now living in the modern world ~ Maitreya, the World Teacher and The Masters of Wisdom ~ to help and inspire humanity in its task of global transformation ~ to create a civilisation based on sharing, justice and peace; for humanity to act - to share and save our world.\n\nFrom ancient times, a body of spiritual teachings known as the Ageless Wisdom has been handed down from generation to generation. A systematic and comprehensive account of the evolution of consciousness in humanity and nature, it describes how the universe came to exist, how it operates, and humanity\u2019s place within it.\n\nAs humanity matures, further aspects of this previously hidden knowledge are released in a wider, more open manner. Throughout the last 100 years, the Ageless Wisdom Teachings have been communicated through individuals such as Helena Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society, and later by Alice A. Bailey and Helena Roerich; followed by Benjamin Creme.\n\nAlong the lines of these teachings, humanity is once again at a critical point in its further development, now with a growing awareness of the necessity for unity, justice and peace.\n\nAccording to these teachings, Maitreya \u2013 known as the Teacher for this coming Age of Aquarius \u2013 will emphasise the utter necessity for peace, and that the complete renunciation of war can only be achieved by trust. Sharing alone, Maitreya will affirm, can engender that trust.\n\n\n~ followed by short Transmission Meditation session ~\n\nShare International New Zealand.

Although they have recently been involved in the setting up of a Dragonfly Hotspot at Exbury Gardens in Hampshire, England, their work currently centres on New Zealand where awareness of the significance of dragonflies is possibly behind that of the U.K, which has a growing understanding that dragonflies are a key indicator of the health of waterspaces. In this talk, Ruary takes his listeners back to basics on the amazing life-cycle of these insects.

Applicable in all situations of life, no need to own your own place.\nDoris will share her journey of integrating the permaculture design approach into her life's questions, her diverse home and community projects in Paekakariki (eg. PaeCycle, a food scrap collection set up and Pataka Kai, the public cupboard to give and take food abundance), and as Trustee of Toru Education: Motivated by an sense of urgency and responsibility to take care of our finite resources and to care for our environment with all its diverse wildlife and each other. Through storytelling and practical examples, we'll explore how these principles can help shape our lives and communities for the better, and how we all can contribute as individuals. Every choice we make matters.\nWe also will take a stroll through Doris's garden and engage in some hands-on activities to experience some of the principles in action. Of course, we will spend some time at the various compost heaps (Compost is Doris' middle name!). Regenerating soil with home made compost! Making compost involving food scraps (closely predator managed) or from garden waste (free standing heaps). \nLunch will be provided\u2014feel free to bring a small contribution to go with the homemade bread if you'd like (but not expected).\nAfter lunch, we will explore the design process of creating a base map for your specific setting, whether it be a your home garden, personal question such as 'What's next?' or a community project.\nNo prior experience in permaculture is needed. We hope you will leave with new ideas and connections, practical inspiration for your own compost making and an enhanced understanding of how many ways you can apply the permaculture design process and create community, one compost heap at the time!\nThere will also be a crop swap table where we practice the permaculture approach of reciprocity of 'give and take'; you might enjoy bringing seeds, seedlings, produce from your garden, and walk away with something unexpected (again, don't feel obliged to contribute).\nSpaces are limited to 15 spaces to fit into our living room, so make sure you reserve your spot.

    "description": "Carnival of Chaos, Myth, chaos, murder, alchemy, mystery, and devils are afoot in this four-night festival featuring six short retellings of classic works with strange new twists! We invite you to THEA 303\u2019s \u2018Carnival of Chaos\u2019 in Studio 77, premiering hybrid works from the House of Echoes (1 & 3 October): The Odyssey, Medea\u202fand\u202fThe Devil is a Lover, and the House of Secrets (2 & 4 October): Rope, The Taming of the Shrew\u202f and\u202f God\u2019s Gift.\n\nEach adaptation has been directed, designed, produced, choreographed and managed by the students.\n\nHouse of Echoes (Season A): Performs on the 1st and the 3rd of October\n\nThe Odyssey \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Homer\u2019s The Odyssey\nOdysseus just wants to get home to his true love, but the journey isn\u2019t exactly smooth. The streets after 2 a.m. and too many beers are alive with obstacles; cops are grumpy, goth girls are tempting, and the help of the Gods is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought. Betrayal, hurt, and anger push her to the edge making her act in ways she never thought she would. \u201cHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned.\u201d\n\nThe Devil is a Lover \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Love Labours Lost\u202fand Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Devil is an Ass\nSatan and two devils, Beelzebub and Pug, make a pact to travel to a 1920s speakeasy on Earth and abstain from corruption for 3 years. As the narrative combines absurdist actions with Shakespearean dialogue, the three devils quickly learn of the difficulties present in avoiding corruption and the effect their devilish meddling has on humanity.\n\nHouse of Secrets (Season B): Performs on the 2nd and 4th of October\n\nRope \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Patrick Hamilton\u2019s\u202fRope\u202f(1929)\nNot a\u202fwhodunnit, but a\u202fhowdoyahideit? Marion and Melanie are sure they\u2019ve committed the perfect murder by killing their friend Norman and hiding his body in a chest, a chest their select group of friends have been invited over to have a murder mystery games night around. It\u2019s foolproof, until the over analytical Constance comes to play\u2026\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew\nIn 1970's Aotearoa, sisters Katherina and Bianca find their love lives complicated by their father's order that one may not pursue romance unless the other follows suit. The sudden appearance of a charming factory owner and friend of Bianca's beau could mark a new hope for the two, but will this lead to an ocean of love or does something far more sinister lurk beneath the surface?\n\nGod\u2019s Gift \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Alchemist\nThe Carnival has come to town in 1615 London. Lovewit has gone to see the show, leaving her manor in the hands of Jeremy the Butler, the \u201cAlchemist,\u201d and Dol, a hardworking prostitute. Lovewit\u2019s house becomes a place for schemes, with ample opportunities to take money from foolish men. Will Dol be happy with her split of the money? Or will a surprise visitor shake things up?\n\nContent Forecast: mentions of and implied sexual violence and domestic abuse, mentions of drug use, strobe lighting, violence, coarse language, loud noises, haze, and smoke.",

Upon reaching the gods of Mictl\u00e1n, an offering had to be made to them in order to obtain eternal rest.\n\nWhat to Expect\nClaudio will explain why it is important to celebrate and take the time to honour and remember the members of your family, ancestors and loved ones who have passed away. He will also explain the mysticism and spirituality around the Day of the Dead celebration.\n\nWe\u2019ll also learn how to set up your ofrenda, or altar, and which elements are important for it (as well their meaning).\n\nIt's very common for an ofrenda of the dead to be placed inside Mexican homes, decorated with papel picado, food, traditional sweets, and photos of loved ones. Candles and marigold flowers are also placed as a sign of welcome for our loved ones.\n\nFeel free to bring photos of your beloved ones that have passed away, fruits and flowers for the altar and anything that your beloved ones valued / loved when they were here with us.

    "description": "Eastbourne Garden Show, Step into a world of six acclaimed private gardens each a living canvas of colour, design and inspiration from lush natives to sculpted landscapes. Each garden tells a story and provides a visual image of wonderful creations.\nOne garden, allegedly with the best vista, has not been opened to the public before. One garden has previously featured in the House and Garden magazine. The tour (self-guided) will begin with lunch and an opportunity to buy potted plants in the tranquil St Alban's church garden, 11 Ngaio St Eastbourne, Lower Hutt, Wellington. The tour will end with hors d'oeuvre, wine and live music in the last garden.\nThis is a chance not just to visit amazing gardens but support the earthquake strengthening of St Alban's historic church and hall for a rejuvenated community hub.\nSt Albans church garden\nThe six private gardens all lie within a less than 100 m walk of the 83 Metlink Marine Parade bus route, but a car or bicycle would be more convenient.\nA glimpse of the six separate gardens (a-e).\na\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\nf\nThe garden show is in support of earthquake strengthening of the de Jersey Clere designed St Alban's church and adjacent hall to remake this a community hub.\nFor the last hundred years and more, this beautiful church designed by acclaimed architect Frederick de Jersey Clere has been the heart of Anglican parish life for people in the eastern bays of Wellington. People have rejoiced, prayed and wept in it through happy family milestones and sad occasions, through two world wars and countless celebrations and crises. Along with its parish hall and tranquil garden, it has been the base for social and community services and outreach, and its memorial wall houses the ashes of local residents.\nBut in 2016 the congregation had to suddenly leave the church, which was deemed an earthquake risk.\nSince then, the parish has explored alternatives for continuing its life and service to the people of the eastern bays. In that process it has kept its ministry and worship going through borrowed premises in local schools and other churches. Now, however, the parish has decided it needs to go back to its original base and strengthen both St Alban\u2019s Church and the parish hall so it can continue to serve the community from its heart and home in Ngaio Street, for the next hundred years and more.\nDetailed plans for strengthening the church and hall to meet acceptable safety standards have been drawn up, and fund-raising is under way. The parish is a registered charity (CC22188) and tax-deductible receipts will be issued for all donations.\nPostponement by 1 day to 30 Nov if weather were to dictate and would be announced on this web site.",

    "description": "Summer Camp Closing Party! | Dillon Jo, Miles Calder & Keira Batten Coogan, San Fran Summer Camp is back for 2026!\n\nJoin us and some of Te Whanganui-a-Tara\u2019s finest artists over five nights across January and February with tickets from $10 or a season pass for $40, featuring drink specials and cocktails thanks to our sponsor Jameson.\n\nHere it is\u2026 our final night! Featuring not one, not two, but THREE of P\u014dneke\u2019s premier acts to close our 2026 series out.\n\nDillon Jo is the genre defying project of Wellington Based artists Betty Smith and Georgie Levien. Dillon Jo built paths between the elements of dream pop, shoegaze, folk, alt rock, and indie pop to create their genre defying sound. Having recently recruited Kahu Sanson-Burnett and Ruadh Munro, Dillon Jo has transformed their live sets into an unbridled big-sound shoegaze experience.\nMiles Calder released his solo debut album Autopilot Life in 2021, a self-reflective delve into waking up from an unexamined life, dressed in a psychedelic folk-rock palette that evoked late-era Beatles as much as contemporaries like Kevin Morby and Father John Misty. The album won over new fans and critics alike & led to a nomination for a prestigious Aotearoa Music Award (Te Kaipuoro Taketake Toa | Best Folk Artist 2022). \n\nKeira Batten Coogan writes raw and messy music for alien listeners. Joined onstage by some familiar P\u014dneke talent, his earnest earworms pack more punch than ever. Themes of queerness, growing pains, love, and nostalgia shine through his lyricism and captivates audiences. \n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

They unpredictably juxtapose intimate, soft, vocals and delicate instrumental passages with raucous, high-energy outbursts. They\u2019re exciting to listen to, and their singles \u2018Debt Collector\u2019 & \u2018Boat Ramp + Jitterbug\u2019 will have you struggling to put them in a box and itching to hear what\u2019s next.\nNew noise in the scene, King Hit, is a Te Whanganui A Tara based four piece that blends together the jarring-ness of shoe-gaze, the punch of hardcore, with the sombreness of midwest emo. After a successful release of their debut single \u2018asterisk\u2019, King Hit are poised to release their follow up single \u2018Sap\u2019, an grungy-yet-ethereal longing love song.\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

Weaving together synthesisers and swirling guitar strums with rock and jazz inspired drum beats, BADTAB creates a unique and refreshing sound. The band made their mark in 2024 with a prolific run of releases. September saw the drop of The P\u014dneke Sessions, collaborative EP with Cellz. Then came December\u2019s Echo Chambers Of\u2026, their full-length debut album that introduced the world to BADTAB\u2019s expansive soundscape. Since the release of their debut album, they have been deep in the works on their sophomore album which is anticipated for a 2026 summer release.\n\nBri Louise blends sultry queer with smooth love and undeniable groove. Their sound has roots in Gospel and Neo-Soul, evolving into a rich fusion of Jazz, Hip-Hop, and R&B. Bri\u2019s music features a talented live band that supports their poetic lyrics with colourful keys, phatty bass, flashy beats, vibrant guitar and fruity woodwinds.\n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

Featuring local legends Daisy Grae and rising stars Yawner.\n\nDaisy Grae is a Wellington-born band that has been grooving in the local scene since their early high school days. Taking influence from genres across the board, Daisy Grae has crafted their very own brand of alternative funk rock. They consistently bring a refined, heavy, and psychedelic energy to the P\u014dneke music scene. Feeding off a fresh sound, this ever-evolving 4-piece of passionate personalities continue to be recognised as one of P\u014dneke\u2019s most exciting live homegrown experiences.\n\nYawner are a Poneke-based R&B group formed in late 2024, bringing together a tight, groove-driven sound alongside the unmatched vocal talents and timbre of Eden Brown. Since their formation, the band have spent the better half of 2025 meticulously refining their identity as a unit, and are now more ready than ever to share it. Focusing on a heavy-hitting but soothing craft, they\u2019ve put together an enormous live set which is not to be missed.",

Driven by groove and the desire to find meaning in the moments on this journey we call life, the musician, songwriter and producer has a signature sound that stands out and stuns. Fowles would describe his music as psychedelic soul laced with blues and funk. It resonates with deep grooves and driving rhythms created by vintage drum sounds, digital sonics, and electric guitars that build and blaze into billowing soundscapes. At its core is his unique, soulful voice and the punchy, heartfelt lyrics he wears on his sleeve.\n\nElly Mae crafts songs that encapsulate the bittersweet ache of growth, the quiet unraveling of time, and the soft glow of nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, indie, shoegaze, and anything in between. From lullabies that make you feel weightless to being wrapped in a blanket of sound, Elly Mae's folk/country melodic guitar style is accompanied by experimental, spatial bass from Arran Cargill-Brown and textured pocket drumming from Sasha Francis-Murray. \n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

We have secured the one and only COKI for an intimate warehouse rave at an inner city location.\n\nThis legend of bass needs no introduction, but we\u2019ll give him one anyway. As one half of DIGITAL MYSTIKZ, Coki has made sine waves move like no other, architecting much of the sonic blueprint that modern dubstep has become known for. Alongside Mala, he helped forge the DMZ sound and is now making his way to Wellington for a rare showcase of pure low-frequency warfare. Expect heavyweight pressure, bone-rattling subs, and that unmistakable Coki wobble - this is dubstep in its rawest form.\n\nOn support we have drawn for the best of the best. Opening up proceedings we have BABETECH, champion selector and vibe master. Since murking opening slots for Loefah, Filth and Kahn & Neek as well as spreading the gospel of bass for countless evenings on RadioActive, we can\u2019t think of a better opener for this night.\n\nFollowing that, we have dubstep extraordinaire DUSTY warming things up with his signature and gruelling take on the classic dubstep sound. With releases on Infernal Sounds and Leather Kennel, Dusty has proven himself to be a force to be reckoned with, and is surely one of the most exciting young producers in the game today.\n\nOn closing duties we have the Support Your Local crew going b2b with Young Gho$t to round out the night with a bit of silliness.\n\nWe\u2019ve managed to secure an all-new inner city warehouse location for this one, and its Further Sound on soundsystem duties this time, heating things up with their BANSHEE SOUNDSYSTEM, preparing for only its second full rollout after Cuba Dupa this year.\n\nWe\u2019re unbelievably excited to share this space with you all for a dance and are expecting this to be one for the books.Secure your tickets now and don\u2019t miss out on this momentous and legendary dance music event!\n\nTickets: https://events.humanitix.com/coki-uk-warehouse-rave\n\n",

Seen collectively, this visual record aims to place the Kai Tahi development into the wider history of construction along Te Awarua-o-Porirua Harbour.\n\nThe exhibition traces a history of harbourside settlement from M\u0101ori pa sites, to whaling stations, early settler communities, harbour reclamation, big box retail and now, in 2025, the next community-focused iteration of harbourside settlement, as exemplified by Kai Tahi and the reuse of existing industrial forms.\n\nKai Tahi has a simple but powerful mission: to transform the traditional idea of a food-court into a cultural and creative harbourside hub for the Porirua Community.\n\nHistoric images on display include aerial photographs from Whites Aviation, 19th century engravings and 20th century paintings.",

Off the back of a monstrous summer, which saw them play 19 shows up and down the country, the pair have spent most of 2025 in the studio finessing their own brand of audio alchemy and preparing to release their label, also named XCOMMUNICATE.\n\nUsually XCOMMUNICATE is a 6 hour journey though decades and sonic realms, however as Heylady is still recovering from a mighty dose of burnout they\u2019ve roped in a couple of their good friends, who happen to be some of Wellington\u2019s finest, to join them as they lay down four hours of four to the floor.\n\nHalo is a mainstay on Wellington dancefloors and it was a no brainer asking her to be on this lineup. A DJ since 2000, she has played festivals across the country and never fails to rock her slot. Her set at Taniwha\u2019s Den last summer was a big highlight and one of the best of the festival. Halo\u2019s ability to drive forward thinking sound and her clever construction of sets are just two reasons you need to be on her floor.\n\nDJ Coda is the godfather of techno in New Zealand. With a career that spans decades, he isn\u2019t just a DJ but a dedicated promoter and one of the trustees of NZ\u2019s longest running student radio station, Radio Active. Part of the COMMUNICATE family from the get go (and a longtime collaborator of Heylady\u2019s), DJ Coda is a master of his craft and never fails to deliver. Armed with knowledge , taste and a hefty love of Detroit, DJ Coda is the man when it comes to rocking the dance floor.\nFirst release tickets are on sale now, grab yours before they are gone and come and dance the evening away with four of the best. We recommend arrive early so you don\u2019t miss out on any of the sets, they are all going to be killer.\n\nIMPORTANT INFO:\nOur event is a safe space for all. If you or someone you know is feeling unsafe or harassed, please approach one of the DJs or bar staff. If you are behaving badly and impacting others ability to have a good time safely, you will be removed. Please act with respect and care for your fellow attendees at all times, no means no and this goes for conversations as well as more intimate requests.\n\n",

    "description": "British and Irish Film Festival - A Room with a View, A Room With a View captured the attention of the world upon its release, bringing the novel by E.M. Forster to dazzling life in the Florentine countryside and in the well-appointed homes of the English Edwardian upper classes. A comedy of manners with a quick wit and impeccable comic timing, A Room With A View is also a portrait of the quiet solitude that lies beneath Forster\u2019s characters, and of the need for human connection in a world of rigid convention.\n\nThe young Englishwoman Lucy Honeychurch (played by Helena Bonham Carter), arrives in Florence on a Baedecker-style grand tour with her aunt Charlotte Bartlett (Maggie Smith). Through a series of events involving English expatriates Miss Eleanor Lavish, an unflappable novelist (Judi Dench), and the Emersons, a free-thinking father and son (played by Denholm Elliot and Julian Sands), Lucy\u2019s life is changed forever under a loggia in Florence and in the Tuscan countryside.\n\nIvory\u2019s delicate and playful direction spirits us from an adventure in the back alleys of Florence, lost with Dench and Smith, to the lace-parasolled rigidity of English lawn parties. Shot on location in and around Florence (including unforgettable scenes in the Piazza della Signoria and at Giotto\u2019s frescoes in Santa Croce), A Room With A View made stars not only of Bonham Carter, Day Lewis and Sands, but of the Tuscan landscapes and Puccini arias (as sung by Kiri Te Kanawa) featured throughout.\n\nDirector\nJames Ivory\n\nProducer\nIsmail Merchant\n\nCast\nMaggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Denholm Elliot, Julian Sands",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

You can either select 'Daytime' or 'Evening' which will let you watch three features total. Daytime tickets are from 1:30pm until the dinner break (around 7:00pm). Evening are from the dinner break until the end of the last film.\n\nSurprise we are running a 35mm Mystery Marathon very soon! We have had some exciting news that we cannot share for now but as a result we must move our beautiful 35mm from its usual location into storage for a bit. We are not sure when it will be set back up so to celebrate we are running a marathon of six 35mm features across one Saturday!\n\nWe will kick off the first film at 1:30pm sharp on Saturday and will have a short dinner break after the third film. All going to plan we should be done by around 12:30am.\n\nIn terms of the features, we have films from the 1960s through to the early 2000s with a mix of comedies, sci-fi, horror and cult classics! Granted not all of these films would be considered masterpieces but there is nothing more fun than sitting in a crowd not knowing what could be coming next!\n\nWe will have a snack menu you can pre-order before the first film so aim to arrive around 1:00pm to order. The breaks between films will be very short (probably just enough time for the projectionist to thread up the next film) so make sure you come prepared for back-to-back screenings.\n\nThis event has strictly no digital projection, it\u2019s all film all the time. Now in theory it should all playback without a hitch as we are bringing in some of the best projectionist\u2019s Wellington has. But 35mm is a strange beast that can sometimes throw up the odd issue.\n\nFull marathon tickets (Admit) are $50\nHalf Marathon - Daytime are $30\nHalf Marathon - Evening are $30\n\nSeating is general admission and cinema entrance will be determined by earliest ticket purchase times.",

Unkovski\u2019s loveable debut, the first ever Macedonian film to be awarded at Sundance.\n\nStill reeling from the death of their mother and wife, Ahmet\u2019s family is broken. His father, struggling to come to terms with being sole provider and caretaker for the family, pulls Ahmet from school so he can care for their flock of sheep; meanwhile, his younger brother has become non-verbal since their mother\u2019s death. Music is both medicine and matchmaker for young Ahmet, who escapes his grief and the grim mundanity of life under his oppressive father by blasting beats from the world\u2019s jankiest stereo system to impress local girl Aya, back from Germany to be betrothed to an older man.\n\nIn this modern-day Romeo and Juliet, the Yuruk mountain village of Kodzalia takes the place of Verona, while the Montagues and Capulets make way for an eclectic support cast, with a technophobic imam, a souped-up tractor and a fluorescent pink sheep all taking the stage. If music be the food of love, then DJ Ahmet is a feast of thumping electro and dance-floor anthems that spur on the teenage protagonist as he fumbles through the throes of his first romance. A jubilant first feature and a real charmer. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

H\u00e9ctor is not. When she tells them she\u2019s pregnant, her own parents can\u2019t hide their shock \u2013 loving but concerned that their daughter will be unable to tackle the task of motherhood. Will the baby be born deaf? Uncertainty abounds as the due date draws closer, and it\u2019s not just \u00c1ngela\u2019s parents who are beginning to have doubts.\n\nThe foundations for the film\u2019s narrative derive from the personal experiences of first-time actor Miriam Garlo, Libertad\u2019s own sister, as she began to contemplate motherhood as a deaf woman. When surrounded by her other deaf friends, \u00c1ngela is comfortable, alive, vibrant within a community that supports her. Around the local mums in the park, or her husband\u2019s friends, isolation sets in with a painful immediacy that anyone who has ever struggled to understand the language in a foreign country will know all too well. A poignant story bound by the chemistry of its leads, deafness is woven into the film as a lived experience, not a defining label. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

    "description": "NZIFF: Dreams (Sex Love), A teenage girl recounts her crush for her teacher through the pages of a memoir. The winner of the Golden Bear 2025 is a lucid and tender chronicle of the unforgettable experience of first love.\n\nOriginally intended as the second chapter in his trilogy and released in Norway as such, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Dreams ended up premiering internationally as the last. But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Through the stories of a straight woman and a gay man, Haugerud defies conventions with humor and compassion, in an eloquent and moving masterwork on human relations in the 21st century.\n\nWhat is love? The age-old question finds a contemporary and adult declination in Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s final chapter to his Sex Dreams Love trilogy, premiered to universal acclaim at the Venice Film Festival 2024.\n\nLong, bright Oslo summer days form the backdrop as two medical colleagues, one straight, the other gay, follow parallel trajectories in the games of love, attraction, sex and empathy. Meeting by chance on a ferry, the two describe their searches for intimacy. Marianne is into dating and is looking for love, Tor is looking for sex \u2013 by cruising for men on dating apps as he rides to and fro on the ferries. Through Haugerud\u2019s effortlessly unpredictable writing, the ferry turns into a magic vessel where the destinies of these two take unexpected turns\u2026\n\nWith Love, Haugerud questions conventions with detached humor, yet he always treats his characters with profound compassion, delivering an eloquent and moving masterpiece on human relationships in the 21st century. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

As emotional walls come down, doubts arise: is there more to the care offered than simple kindness?\n\nLaura and Betty seem to be poles apart. Laura, a young, city dwelling music student, lives in an apartment with her boyfriend; Betty has an adult son and lives alone in rural Germany. Their lives are thrown together after a car accident leaves Laura in the care of the older woman. Despite ostensible differences, each recognises a familiar melancholy in the other. As a tentative trust grows, the women find something unlocking within themselves, even as complicating factors emerge, in the form of Betty\u2019s opaque family situation.\n\nMaster dramatist Christian Petzold reunites with frequent acting collaborator Paula Beer (Transit, Undine, Afire) and regular DOP Hans Fromm, turning his pen and camera to a smaller scale domestic drama. Mirrors No. 3 (named for a Ravel piano piece played within) makes visual and thematic echoes back to Petzold\u2019s previous work: from extended bike rides down rural lanes (Barbara), to the centrality of a piano (Phoenix), as well as the thread of mysterious tension that underlies them all. The film revels in the messy, stimulating complexities of human relationships, exploring the way that sometimes even questionable motivations can affect positive outcomes. \u2014 Jacob Powell",

(Gustav\u2019s comeback project will be distributed through Netflix, and the divisive streamer is the target of a couple of the screenplay\u2019s better barbs.) Much of Sentimental Value takes place in the Borg family\u2019s home, and an efficient flashback, framed as an essay Nora wrote as a girl, explains how they have lived in the house for generations\u2026 That slightly fading family home becomes an apt metaphor for the weathered bond Nora, Agnes and Gustav share, although Reinsve\u2019s fragile performance articulates the festering resentment she feels toward her absent father.\nTrier\u2019s third picture to screen at Cannes, after 2021\u2019s The Worst Person In The World\u2019s breakout lead Reinsve won Best Actress, the reunion of director and star will entice arthouse crowds\u2026 and those seeking a smart, thoughtful tearjerker should be pleased with this sentimental but farfrom-mawkish film.\u201d \u2014 Tom Grierson, Screen Daily",

After winning all major laurels in Nordic cinema with his impressive fresco Beware of Children (2019), the acclaimed director and author embarkson an Oslo-set trilogy simply called Sex Dreams Love.\n\nThe first instalment opens on one of the most tantalising and unexpected preludes in recent cinema. Two chimney sweeps frankly open up to each other on a coffee break in their office: the first reveals that he dreamt of being intensely looked at by none other than David Bowie, who was inspecting him as if he was a woman; the other confesses that he recently accepted the sexual advances of a male customer who asked him to have sex with him. But both men are \u201cstraight\u201d and married to women. Here, the deft tone of the film and Haugerud\u2019s rules of the game are immediately set.\n\nA fervent admirer of Eric Rohmer\u2019s thickly scripted skirmishes of love and ethics, the Norwegian writer-director infuses irony, depth and compassion in each of his elegantly composed tableaux depicting how the two men cope with the turmoil these experiences bring to their relationships with their partners and family, but most of all with themselves. Featuring some of the brightest and funniest dialogues of 2024, Sex is a real eye-opener. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor.

Inseparable in childhood, the brothers drifted apart as adults, brother Rocky (also O\u2019Brien) living out and proud in Portland while Roman lived a (decidedly hetero) tradie life in hometown Idaho.

Distance and death became everyday realities for Kiwis at home \u2013 and caused griefs that were at times taboo and suppressed.\n\nDame Gaylene Preston frames seven women, including her own mother, against a black background that creates a stage for their candid, unadorned and surprisingly intimate wartime recollections, as they look back from the 90s in interviews conducted by oral historian Judith Fyfe. The acclaimed documentary, which combines these shared testimonies with personal photographs and newsreel clips, conveys the immense pressure to conform to the value of stoic sacrifice for the cause under the scrutinising eye of neighbours, and reveals lesser-seen layers of resilience.\n\nMarriages in the first flush of romance were cut short, pregnancies were navigated alone, conscientious objectors were met with ostracisation and American servicemen scorned, in a nation united around support of their boys in combat overseas \u2013 a state of affairs in which women were often granted little voice, as they took on more labour, and absorbed life-changing losses. \u2014 Carmen Gray",

The unexpected suicide of her partner has left her a hollowed-out shell \u2013 that is, until Jack (Dacre Montgomery), Elizabeth\u2019s long-absent son, arrives at the funeral, apparently invited by Jill herself, though she does not remember doing so.\n\nThe circumstances of Jack\u2019s long absence are unclear \u2013 all that is known is that Jack was given up for adoption at a very young age. Staying the night at Jill and Elizabeth\u2019s oppressive, concrete-clad mountain abode, it quickly becomes clear that the spirit of Elizabeth has not yet departed \u2013 instead, she has gained the ability to possess both wife and son and is utilising this ability to linger and address the needs of either relationship. What initially seems to be a gift from beyond, however, begins to sour when long-hidden secrets of the past begin to emerge, and lines between the two begin to be crossed.\n\nThe sophomore feature of Samuel Van Grinsven, Went Up the Hill is a wintry, gothic affair, and a showcase for the untapped talents of Montgomery, who most will recognise as the golden-haired, ill-fated muscle mutt Billy from Stranger Things. Essentially a two-hander (with occasional, welcome interjection from Kiwi legend Sarah Peirse as Jack\u2019s frosty, mystery-shrouded aunt), Van Grinsven tracks the trajectory of these two adrift people and the spirit between them \u2013 from unexpected refuge, to joy, to dread \u2013 with a purposeful, drip-fed escalation of tension. Questions of control, abuse and the lingering weight of past scars take hold, all while the usually pleasantly scenic Christchurch landscape is transformed into a suffocatingly claustrophobic ice prison. Van Grinsven\u2019s muscular direction bears none of the flashy excesses of an emerging filmmaker \u2013 his vision emerges, stately, imposing and fully-formed. \u2014 Tom Augustine",

Director Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hambalek taps into it with satirical, ribald flair and a twist of the fantastical in a sharp domestic parable for a new era of global surveillance paranoia.\n\nJulia (Julia Jentsch) is precariously close to a full-blown affair with the workmate she flirts with on smoking breaks. Her husband Tobias (Felix Kramer) dreams of getting even with a publishing house colleague who undercuts his authority in editorial design meetings. When their teenager Marielle (Laeni Geiseler) is slapped by a school friend over an insult, the impact leaves her with the sudden telepathic ability to see everything her parents do throughout the day \u2013 a development that spells disaster for the household, as dishonesty can no longer sustain the veneer of stable marital contentment.\n\nAs the family descends into a desperate, riotous war of manipulation, they must experiment with new moral codes. Is radical honesty and defiance the best course of action, or should they stifle egos and instincts in line with their preferred image? Better yet, can Marielle\u2019s new powers be curbed? \u2014 Carmen Gray",

    "description": "Reels for Meals: Prime Minister, September's Reels for Meals movie fundraiser is Prime Minister.\nIn August 2017, in the lead-up to national elections, Jacinda Ardern unexpectedly became New Zealand\u2019s opposition party leader. She had just turned 37. Two frenetic months later, she was Prime Minister. Just before the final vote was in, she discovered she was pregnant. She would become only the second head of state in history to give birth while in office.\nArdern quickly became one of the most recognisable leaders in the world. She drew global attention from people craving a sensitive and compassionate approach to the critical issues of our time. In private, she struggled with being a mother and proving herself to a public skeptical of women\u2019s leadership. A series of crises - the Christchurch massacre, pandemic lockdowns, and disinformation-fueled protests outside Parliament - would test that leadership and the feminine touch she brought to it. She resigned from office in January 2023, shocking her supporters and critics alike.\nGoing behind the scenes of her administration and her private life, Prime Minister follows Jacinda for seven years as she is catapulted to the top of New Zealand politics, becomes a feminist political icon, resigns suddenly from office and continues to champion the fight against isolationism, fear, and the distortion of truth. Intimate home footage shot by her husband and audio interviews that Jacinda did while in office give us unparalleled access. Along with in-depth contemporaneous interviews, these form the emotional backbone of the story, giving viewers an unfiltered window into her years in power.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba\u2019s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives.\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time.

Can one go back after decades of conflict? Can they rebuild and start anew to live in peace with themselves and others?\n\"Return to Babylon\" is a road movie from Sarcelles to Erbil, following S\u00e9miramis and her family on a journey that leads them to question their future in France and the fate of their community in the Middle East.\nA film by Marie Dault, S\u00e9miramis Ide, and S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nDirected by S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nScreen time: 52-minutes; French and Assyrian with subtitles\nLink to the English-subtitled trailer: https://www.instagram.com/p/DDzsYJzt_B9/\nThe screening event will be held at the Cockburn Street Chapel, 1 Cockburn Street, Kilbirnie, Wellington from 5-7pm.\n\nEntrance is free, but please register to confirm your attendance.\n\nWe welcome koha (donations) which will go towards supporting the ACEYA Wellington Branch's youth-focused activities and events.",

There are three distinct sections, times are approximate. The event is R18, nothing is overly controversial but one film is a horror movie rated R18 for violence and nudity. The line up is subject to change but here is an indication:\nFilm:\nStandard 8mm film - 10 minutes\nSuper 8mm film - 20 minutes\n16mm film -90 minute urban adventure\nAnalog Video:\nBetamax - 90 minute horror\nVHS - 90 minute action\nLaserdisc- 100 minute scifi action \n\nDigital Video:\nVCD- 100 minutes comedy\nDVD - 100 minutes ???\nHD-DVD TBC\nThe film will be played on film projectors, the analog video on a CRT video projector (all going well) and the digital video on a digital video projector. All in either mono or glorious 2.0 stereo sound. Most projection is on a 2 meter wide screen.\nThere will be a half hour break between the analog and digital video sections. And smaller breaks during some format changeovers.\nSeating provided will largely be camping chairs, if you want to bring your own chair you can- and there is a reduced ticket price option. This is intended for normal sized chairs, a camping chair, an office chair etc, not a huge armchair. There is limited space where you could bring your own beanbag up front, but you may be staring up at a sharp angle.\n\nWhat this isn\u2019t:\nThis is not polished professional event, it's a little bit improvised. We\u2019re not screening in a regular cinema, we\u2019re screening at Valhalla who are very kindly giving us a dark versatile space to work in. Technical issues may arise and we will keep on rolling, discarding formats and entire films in the line up if we can\u2019t get them running. Some things have back ups, some don\u2019t. No refunds, your ticket price is directly funding the event, and the event is an experiment. You can leave at any time, but please don\u2019t yo-yo in and out every few minutes.\nThe presentation of the films is experimental, but the films for the most part are narrative drama films, not overly inaccessible.\nValhalla is a licensed venue so please do not bring in alcohol- If you do I will ask you to leave- with no refund! That would be awkward for both of us!",

Borell\u2019s curatorial vision is clear \u2013 M\u0101ori art must be authored, not simply advocated for. For the artists, this represents a chance to be seen on their own terms and is an initiative that ultimately leads some to the global stage of the Venice Biennale. \nBut as the scale of the exhibition grows, so does the institutional resistance. The result is a reckoning: whose story is being told, and who holds the pen? With many of the artworks exploring the legacy of colonialism, the making of the exhibition itself becomes a living reflection of that very struggle. Laying bare behind-the-scenes conversations rarely seen on screen, TOIT\u016a Visual Sovereignty lifts the curtain on the inner workings of an institution and examines the cost of visibility without control \u2013 and the quiet power of walking away. \u2014 Heperi Mita \nThe screening will be followed by a Q and A with Director Chelsea Winstanley.",

Which became the \"Fat Trout Trailer Park\" where the story of the last 7 days of Laura Palmer begins.\nSince its showing at the 1992 Festival De Cannes, no other Lynch film had polarized audiences to such an extent. Fans that wanted more \"Cherry Pie\" and \"Donuts\" from the TV show were served a much darker, unflinching and unforgiving work - in Lynch's own words, a movie about \"the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim\". Derided by critics and many fans at the time it was a commercial box office flop.\nYet in the years since the initial reaction, a gradual wave of reappraisal and appreciation began. With time it's brilliance came into focus with growing acknowledgment, that the film is a more accurate, complex and powerful account of trauma. Combining the dramatic ferocity of Sherly Lee's tour de force and the beauty of Angelo Badalamenti's score, Lynch reclaimed full ownership of the material creating a harrowing, compassionate and enigmatic hymn to Laura Palmer.\nAs we approach the films 34 year anniversary and since Lynch's passing in 2025, it is now regarded by critics and fans worldwide, as a revered epilogue, essential predecessor to \"The Return\", and Lynch's most chilling, terrifying, and yet empathetic and humane cinematic masterpiece.\nWHERE: The Roxy Cinema. 5 Park Road.

Prizes will be awarded to the darkest and most vampiric ensemble. A full bar service will be available throughout.\n\nContinuing our run of film fundraisers, The Hunger allows us queers and our allies to engage with a pillar of queer culture. These screenings are organised and hosted by the community for the community. More than just a screening, this will be a queer horror experience.\n\nThe event begins at 3pm but come early to get comfortable. The film will start at 3.30. A short comfort break will be provided. Stay for a drink to discuss and dissect.\n\nThe Hunger is rated R18. No one under the age of 18 is permitted. Its running length is 97 minutes.\n\nTickets are $20 waged, $13 unwaged.\n\nACCESSIBILITY\n\n- Underworld Tavern is fully wheelchair accessible\n- The movie will include closed captions\n\n",

Dr Barrie has recently revamped the Glendronach lineup, and we're going to see how she's doing: we'll try the previous 12 and 15 year--old bottlings against her new releases. She's worked her magic at Ben Riach, and we'll see how she's doing at Glendronach (I suspect quite well!). Additionally, we'll try the highland peated Glendronach, a departure from the familiar smokey peat of Islay. We'll expect a sweeter, softer style, bolstered by some sherry maturation.\nPlease join me for this wonderful tasting of Glendronachs:\nTuesday, September 9\n7:30pm Start time (arrive early to get a beer and a seat)\n$60 per person\nSeatoun Clubhouse (16 Dundas Street, Seatoun)\nSee you then,\nMatt\nMatt & the Clubhouse Team\n\n*** Please note you need to be a member or a guest of a member to attend.

    "description": "Dragons Is My Uso, Chef Jessica Tang and legendary home chefs Litia Lefaoseu and Iutita Mallon are drawing on the century long fusion of Chinese and Samoan cuisine and the way food expresses love, ai, and alofa. In the late 1800s, small numbers of Chinese settled in Samoa and became part of a growing multicultural community. There they influenced local customs, made an enduring contribution to Samoan cuisine introducing contemporary favourites such as sapasui (chop suey), keke pua\u2018a (pork buns) and of course laisa (rice). \r\n\r\nDragons celebrate this cultural and culinary fusion by showcasing these favourites and presenting new dishes highlighting the shared love of culinary staples such as taro and noodles, rice, fish, and pork, the magnificent spectrum of Chinese herbs, spices and flavours. Through cooking and sharing food together the chefs honour their culinary heritage, strengthen our connections to one another and celebrate the big and little moments in life. This is a shared-style meal, served banquet style on lazy Susan turntables. \r\nDragons is My Uso was one of the sell-out hits of the 2024 festival - don't miss out!\r\n\r\nDiscounted tables for 10 available for $1000, so get the whole aiga together!",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

The failure and harm caused by the so called 'War on Drugs' is acknowledged globally and witnessed first hand here in Aotearoa New Zealand.\n\nBack in 2011 a comprehensive review of the MoDA conducted by New Zealand Law Commission recommended the MoDA \u201cshould be repealed and replaced by a new Act \u2026administered by the Ministry of Health\u201d.

Despite the repeated failure of standard policy processes, citizens assemblies have only recently made it to New Zealand. Register for this event to find out more about the Porirua Assembly on Climate and its innovations. \nPorirua is known for community-led innovations in governance and delivery, and the Porirua Assembly on Climate continued this tradition by being:\nthe first climate assembly in New Zealand,  \nthe first assembly co-designed and organised by an iwi authority and a community group, \nthe first assembly process designed to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi by using a tricameral design,  \nthe first New Zealand assembly to include children and young people, and \nby creating a new local governance body - the Porirua Community Leaders Forum - that sponsored the Assembly, holds its recommendations and can instigate ongoing community dialogue on local issues. \nPanellists will share learning on the Porirua Assembly\u2019s innovations, talk about why the standard citizens assembly model was modified, dig into what enabled so many firsts and how these worked out in practice. They will reflect on this legacy and possible future impacts. Might these democratic innovations strengthen local democracy elsewhere in Aotearoa New Zealand? \nAbout the Host and Speakers\nJodi Watene is a Systems Change Lead at Te R\u016bnanga o Toa Rangatira Incorporated, was the project manager for the Porirua Assembly and is helping to establish a New Zealand Community of Practice on Indigenous Citizens\u2019 Assemblies.\nMakerita Makapelu is a Team Leader for Wesley Community Action in Porirua with a background in performing arts and youth work. She specialises in community-led development and grassroots systems change, and was one of the Porirua Assembly facilitators.  \nCally O'Neill was a participatory designer of community spaces until 2019 when she shifted her focus towards advocating for Te Tiriti-based deliberative democracy to address the climate and other contemporary crises.

The book will be launched by Charlotte MacDonald.\n\nTuesday 7 October, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nAll welcome!\n\n'Existing views of Featherston are fragmentary, negative and not very satisfactory. He was the \u201clittle Doctor\u201d, a single-minded despot wielding tyrannical power and casting an oppressive shadow. As I began to understand more of his life, I realised that there was little appreciation of a man who had contributed so much.\u2019 \u2014John E.Martin\n\nIsaac Featherston was at the heart of some of the most significant developments in New Zealand from the 1840s colonisation by the New Zealand Company to the abolition of the provinces in 1876. A doctor, newspaper editor and politician, he advocated for the provinces against the domination of central government, while also being primarily responsible for the relocation of the capital from Auckland to Wellington in 1865.\n\nKnown amongst M\u0101ori as \u2018Petatone\u2019 and with a reputation for directness and honesty, he was at the very centre of P\u0101keh\u0101\u2013M\u0101ori relations, and in his 1857 official portrait is depicted alongside leading rangatira Te Puni and Wi Tako.\n\nAbout the author: Dr. John E. Martin has researched and written about New Zealand history since the 1980s, teaching in universities and employed as a historian in the public sector. He was parliamentary historian in the 2000s and 2010s. His publications include rural and labour history, the history of science and engineering, and social and political history. His books include The Forgotten Worker (1990), People, Politics and Power Stations (1991 and 1998), Holding the Balance (1996), The House: New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives, 1854\u20132004 (2004), Parliament\u2019s Library (2008), Honouring the Contract (2010), Illuminating Our World (2017), A Colonist\u2019s Gaze (2018) and most recently Empire City: Wellington Becomes the Capital of New Zealand (2022).",

After the short break, we\u2019ll regroup for a Q&A session and finish with a tote bag-making activity led by Paek\u0101k\u0101riki artist Selina Tuomey.\n\nHe Kura Toi Tangata exhibition ends Sunday 12 October.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Gaayathri\n\nGaayathri Nair is a double diaspora person hailing from the southwest of India via Malaysia and coming to Aotearoa through economic migration in the 1980's under Rogernomics. She grew up in T\u0101maki Makaurau and now lives in Te Awakairangi and works in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. She is a counsellor and facilitator, novice gardener, passionate knitter, frazzled PhD student, and shares a home with a delightfully awkward greyhound named Kevin.\n\n\n\nAbout Krissi\n\nKrissi Smith is of primarily Scottish (Clans McColl, Ross, Hogarth, Sutherland, Buchanan, Mactavish), Irish and English descent, but she grew up in Te Upoko o te Ika on Taranaki Wh\u0101nui land. She currently lives in Te Ngaengae in Te Awakairangi, still on Taranaki Wh\u0101nui land, and close to Waiwhet\u016b. Krissi is a Tiriti educator, an accredited interpreter and translator, and a teacher of te reo M\u0101ori. She co-directs K\u016bwaha Ltd, with two of her besties: T\u0101whana Chadwick and Raih\u0101nia Tipoki. She's also a m\u0101m\u0101 to one kid, one step kid, and Nanna to one moko. She has three dogs and five chickens. She loves growing kai and cooking it for people, singing karaoke, and sewing. She's a lover of learning and is getting pretty damn comfortable with not knowing the answers!\n\n\n\nAbout Selina\n\nSelina Tuomey has an Irish father and an English mother. She came to Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa for the love of this land and a man. As a child in England, her most cherished possession was an Air New Zealand green, plastic tiki sent to her by her pen friend.\n\nShe is a mother to three sixth-generation, beautiful, young P\u0101keh\u0101 people. Selina has a Fine Art BA Hons and is all about art and nature, acting, painting, murals, clay play and drawing. She has a love of colour, growing trees, food and going bush. Selina is a mermaid and loves people. He tangata, he tangata, he tangata.",

Yet, despite its growing prominence, the conceptual boundaries of this form of cooperation remain underdeveloped. This seminar addresses this gap by proposing a comparative framework that distinguishes minilateralism from other established modes of cooperation\u2014not only bilateralism and multilateralism, but also plurilateralism and regionalism. Through this analytical distinction, the study clarifies the conceptual contours of minilateralism and illuminates its purposive and exclusive character. By advancing a sharper theoretical understanding, this research contributes to the conceptual lexicon of international relations and enhances our grasp of cooperation dynamics in the Indo-Pacific.\n Mr Ryosuke Hanada is a PhD candidate and Sessional Teaching Staff at the School of International Studies, Macquarie University. He was a Research Fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs (JIIA), researching Japan\u2019s foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific region from 2016 to 2020.

A large part of the book is devoted to Southeast Asia\u2019s responses to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At the end of the talk Dr Storey will also provide an update of Russia-Southeast Asia relations in 2025 and how the region views the on-going Russia-Ukraine War.\nDr Ian Storey is a Senior Fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Singapore.

The inclusion of considerable footage from Jacinda's partner Clarke Gayford provides a deeply personal view of life as the Prime Minister in very challenging times.\n(Los Angeles Times review) 'Prime Minister' is not interested in wrangling, dealing and lawmaking, or even the nuts and bolts or her progressive views. .. But in the fleet, pacey manner of the editing, toggling between private and public moments with highlight-reel efficiency, the film is a stirring glimpse of top-down kindness as a winning leadership style.",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University.

    "description": "The Liberal International Order as a Core-Periphery Order: An Alternative History with Multiple Deep Contestations, I offer an alternative macrohistory of the Liberal International Order (LIO) that was explicitly designed to perpetuate Western dominance and American hegemony. The LIO is better understood as a core-periphery order because inequality between the Western-core and the \u2018Restern\u2019-periphery was constitutive of it. (Re-)Imperialism\u2014not just liberalism\u2014remained a central ordering mechanism well after 1945. I show the two-way deep contestations between the liberal and anticolonial ordering projects, especially at the 1955 Bandung Conference. Contra the post-LIO pessimism of disorder/chaos, I argue that the normative agency of the Southeast Asian states informed by the legacy of Bandung is heralding a multiplex, multi-regional world order. As the declining inequality between the West and Asia transforms the core-periphery LIO, the emergent decentered world order will lack a core, whether Western/liberal or Asian. This deep transformation should be welcomed, not deeply contested, although coexistence and global integration require embracing deep pluralism, not liberalism.\nManjeet S.

    "description": "Treasury Guest Lecture with Michael Keen: IN-PERSON attendance, Join us for our special Fiscal Policy for the Future seminar\nNew Zealand faces significant long-term fiscal challenges, including the rising costs associated with an ageing population, increasing demand for public services, and the need to adapt to a changing global economy. These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand. The Trust was established to support leading tax policy thinking in New Zealand. You can read about the Trust\u2019s work here.\nAbout the presenter\nMichael (Mick) Keen is a former Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, where for over twenty years he played a central role in shaping and delivering IMF policies and advice on tax matters.\nHe has advised finance ministries in all parts of the world, including missions to over forty countries, and led the preparation of influential papers for the G20 and the Executive Board of the IMF.\nBefore joining the Fund, Mick was Professor of Economics at the universities of Essex (UK), Queens (Canada) and Kyoto, and is now Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo.\nMick was the keynote speaker at the 2014 conference on the Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand and has provided peer review for Inland Revenue\u2019s previous Long-Term Insights Briefing.\nMick has jointly authored, with Joel Slemrod, Rebellion, Rascals and Revenue \u2013 an entertaining account of how history illuminates the perennial challenges and timeless principles of taxation\u2014and how the past holds clues to solving the tax problems of today.\nAbout this seminar series\nNew ideas, innovative concepts, research evidence and expert advice are all crucial to stimulate and inform the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis and advice. Our current theme for guest lectures - Fiscal Policy for the Future - explores the role of stabilising, sustainable and effective fiscal policy. Speakers provide insights into how fiscal policy can be designed to support government to meet its current and future objectives and obligations while adapting to changing circumstances and delivering value to the New Zealand public.\nFiscal policy has a stabilising role in helping to smooth the business cycle, while sustainability in fiscal policy is foundational for resilience to both shocks and longstanding challenges, such as climate change, technological advancements, and demographic trends. Ensuring effective and value for money expenditure is important so that fiscal policy contributes to the living standards of New Zealanders, both now and in the future.\nPlease note that the views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series are those of the individual presenters. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the New Zealand Treasury or the New Zealand Government.\nFor updates and our latest research visit: www.treasury.govt.nz\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to be the first to hear about our upcoming events in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series, please SUBSCRIBE to stay up to date.",

    "description": "Beyond Sight: The Power of Dyad Meditation, Beyond Sight: The Power of Dyad Meditation\nWhat happens when we strip away the surface layers of small talk, social roles, and even sight itself?\nIn this unique evening, you\u2019ll step into the practice of Dyad Meditation \u2014 a powerful form of authentic relating where two people take turns speaking and listening in complete presence. One person shares, the other simply listens. No interruptions. No fixing. No judgment. Just the rare experience of being fully seen and fully heard.\nThe twist? You\u2019ll be blindfolded.\nBy closing our eyes to the outer world, we drop our guards and tune into something deeper. This creates space for vulnerability, openness, and raw connection that we don\u2019t often experience in daily life.\nExpect an evening that\u2019s real, grounding, and surprisingly freeing \u2014 a chance to connect with yourself and with others in ways that go beyond sight.\nYou don\u2019t need to bring a partner or a friend \u2014 in fact, coming on your own is part of the experience. Everyone will be paired up on the night, so it\u2019s all about connecting beyond familiar circles.\nAfterwards, we\u2019ll share reflections over a nourishing plant-based dinner, keeping the conversation alive in a relaxed space.\nMeet Andre, your host\nAndre has been exploring the art of authentic connection since his teens, when a rite of passage in Golden Bay first sparked his passion for circle work. Since then, he has been creating spaces that invite honesty, vulnerability, and depth \u2014 guiding people into experiences of being truly seen and heard. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and breathwork facilitator, Andre brings creativity and presence to all his offerings, inspired by the question of what it really means to be human.\n................................................................................................\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week. Events range from creative workshops, wellness courses to entertaining experiences. All within a down-to-earth and welcoming space. Each event wraps up with a plant-based dinner and dessert.\n...............................................................................................\nBhakti Lounge\n1/175 Vivian Street\nWellington",

Gamma brainwaves are associated with states of deep meditation, heightened awareness, and higher brain functions.\n\nBreathwork and other deeply meditative practices activate gamma waves and there is a correlation between gamma waves and DMT release, with one seeming to stimulate the other.\n\nBreathwork experiences and benefits so often parallel those of DMT and other psychedelic plant-medicines, DMT is produced naturally in the brain, and is released during Breathwork.\n\n\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude46 \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4e:\n\n\u2022 Anxiety, depression and stress\n\n\u2022 Increase energy & boost immunity\n\n\u2022 Improves sleep\n\n\u2022 Lowers blood pressure & improves circulation\n\n\u2022 Improves mood & self esteem & helps manage depression\n\n\u2022 Relese toxins\n\n\u2022 Helps manage pain & restrictions in the body\n\n\u2022 Releasing trauma & emotion & manage PTSD\n\n\u2022 Gaining body awareness\n\n\u2022 Connecting to intuition and receiving guidance\n\n\u2022 Past life clearing and understanding\n\n\u2022 Spiritual awakening and expansion\n\n\u2022 Karmic release and ancestral work\n\n\u2022 Increasing creativity and self-expression\n\n\u2022 Life purpose clarity\n\nA breathwork journey is unique to each person and and the results are profound.\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a \ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4f:\n\n\u2022 Doors will open at 11.45am and you will have a few moments to get grounded and set up for your \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b experience.\n\n\u2022 We will open up with an introduction to this \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b technique and prepare to start the Breathwork Medicine Journey.\n\n\u2022 You will then be guided through a 90 minute experience recieving healing & expansion bridging the gap between your human self & higher self.\n\n\u2022 Your only job is to be open minded, relax, and let your breath guide you on this medicine journey be open to receive any healing or guidance that comes up throughout the journey.\n\n\u2022 We will close of with an intergration circle finishing up at 2.30PM leaving light grounded and open and with feelings one oneness connected to the universe.\n\n\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude68:\n\nBreathwork results in certain specific physiological changes in the body and also can result in intense physical and emotional release.\n\nAs a precaution, the following conditions are contraindicated in certain breathwork practices.\n\nIt is crucial that you inform your breathwork practitioner if any of the following conditions are relevant to you:\n\n\u2022 Pregnancy (at any stage)\n\n\u2022 Severe PTSD or trauma\n\n\u2022 Currently using recreational drugs\n\n\u2022 Recent surgery\n\n\u2022 Taking any medication that alters brain chemistry like anti-anxiety,anti-depressant, ADD, OCD medications, etc.\n\n\u2022Detached Retina\n\n\u2022Glaucoma\n\n\u2022Kidney disease\n\n\u2022High Blood Pressure\n\n\u2022Cardiovascular disease, including angina, previous heart attack or stroke\n\u2022Diagnosis of aneurysm in the brain or abdomen\n\n\u2022Uncontrolled thyroid conditions\n\n\u2022Diabetes\n\n\u2022Severe Asthma\u2014 for mild to moderate asthma, we can discuss but you must bring your inhaler to the session.\n\n\u2022 Epilepsy\n\n\u2022 History of Seizures\n\n\u2022 Prior diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or previous psychiatric condition.\n\n\u2022Any other medical, psychiatric or physical conditions which would impair or affect the ability to engage in any activities that involve deep physical and/or emotional release.\n\n\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4c\u2019\ud835\ude68:\n\nWhat can I expect?\n\nThere will be a short guided meditation, explanation of conscious connected breathwork (how to do it, tetany, things that may happen etc), a full 60 min breathwork journey and space afterwards for a few to share about their experience and any questions asked and support given if needed.\n\nI have one or more of the listed contraindications -

Through slow, mindful stretches, we begin softening tension and grounding into the present.\n\nYou\u2019ll then be guided through two styles of breathwork \u2014 each offering a unique pathway inward. There\u2019s no pressure or expectation, just the freedom to explore what feels right for you:\n\nA dynamic, connected breath for those who wish to build energy, move emotion, or break through internal blockages\n\nA slow, rhythmic breath for those seeking stillness, calm, and deeper grounding\n\nBoth approaches invite a sense of spaciousness \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally \u2014 while supporting nervous system balance and inner clarity.\n\nTo gently close the session, we\u2019ll move into a quiet, nurturing meditation to support integration and leave you feeling steady, clear, and connected.\n\nAfterwards, stay and enjoy a nourishing plant-based dinner and dessert, lovingly prepared to complement the experience \u2014 because healing is also about how we feed and care for ourselves.\n\nWhy Breathwork?\n\nBreathwork has helped so many shift from a state of tension and overwhelm into a place of ease, clarity, and resilience \u2014 often after just one session. It\u2019s a simple, powerful practice that reconnects you to your body, your breath, and your inner stillness.\n\nYou\u2019ll leave feeling more grounded, more present, and more like yourself again.\n\nMeet Karla, your host\nKarla is a breathwork and trauma-somatic facilitator based in Aotearoa (New Zealand), originally from Malta.

    "description": "CBT skills for physical health practitioners in Aotearoa New Zealand, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention initially developed for emotional disorders. It is now widely used in supporting people to deal with the challenges of physical ill-health. Professionals from various backgrounds can learn to use a simplified CBT skills set, and use of these skills enables them to be more effective in managing aspects of their patients\u2019 distress.\nThe training is a mix of theory, skills demonstration and skills practice, giving participants a better understanding of the applicability of the skill set in their area of practice and providing some skills to take away. Training sessions are spaced to allow participants to use their new skills in their clinical practice. Each participant reflects on their learning and their work with a specific patient, and the whole group reflects on lessons learned. In this way, learning remains rooted in participants\u2019 clinical practice. These CBT courses are consistently evaluated highly by participants.\nThe Course\nTeaching will be commenced with 2 days of in person sessions. 19th and 20th Feb 2026 at Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington and subsequently 2 sessions on-line via Zoom. These will be either 18th or 19th March an 22nd or 23rd April 2026.\nAttendance at all sessions is mandatory to complete the course.\nThe courses cost is $850 per person (incl GST).\nThe Trainers\nKathy Burn was a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Palliative Care who went on to train in CBT and to develop the CBT service at St Christopher\u2019s Hospice, London. She now works in CBT in chronic pain, and she teaches and supervises CBT trainees at the institute of Psychiatry, London.\nKathryn Mannix was a Palliative Medicine Consultant and CBT therapist. She developed \u2018CBT First Aid\u2019 to enable palliative care clinicians to adapt skills from CBT into their clinical practice. She is an author. There are insights into her use of CBT in her books With the End in Mind and Listen.\nTerms and Conditions\nAttendance: In order to create a learning community for each course, it is important that each person on a course attends every session and is able to join in the discussions by keeping up with the course. By accepting a place on a particular course, you agree to attend all the sessions, to arrive on time, and to work alongside your group members during the session to support each other's learning. Each session builds on the last, and you'll be asked to put your new learning into practice in- between sessions. Building learning groups in this way means we can't add new trainees after a course has begun.\nWe are not able to run catch-up sessions for sessions missed. If you miss sessions, you may be asked to withdraw from the course and no refunds will be given.\nRefunds/Canellations: Once you sign up and pay, we won't be able to refund your payment unless we can reallocate your place to another person before the course begins. The deadline for cancelling your place is 28 days before the day and time of the first session. If you cancel and we can fill your place with another person, we'll offer you the choice of a refund or a place on a future course, if places are available. We will do our best to fill your place, but we can't promise this. Refunds will incur an administration fee.\nDates and Times of Sessions: all dates and times are given in NZ time, and this varies over the year. It is up to you to check the correct time in your time zone: you may find this website useful to check your own time zone with Auckland NZ time on each specific date: https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/\nTrainers: we have a team of trainers, all of whom are experienced CBT therapists and trainers, and all are familiar with applying CBT in physical health settings. Different sessions may be taught by different trainers, or by 'guest appearances' by some of our team. The team of trainers will ensure there is continuity of content and of learning as the course progresses.\nSpecial circumstances: Sometimes, life events appear unexpectedly. If something unexpected prevents you from attending, please let us know as early as you can, and we will give consideration to how we might be able to support you to continue your training if that is what you wish to do.",

Where intentional movement meets empowering music.\nThink of it as an hour just for YOU \u2013 to sweat, move however you need to, laugh, release and feel amazing in mind, body + soul.\n\nA space where you can leave your judgements at the door, reconnect with yourself and have some fun!\n\nYin Yoga - A slow-paced style of yoga that emphasizes passive stretching and longer-held poses. It targets the deeper connective tissues of the body, such as ligaments and fascia, rather than the muscles, promoting flexibility, joint health, and relaxation. The practice encourages mindfulness and introspection, creating a calming contrast to more vigorous, dynamic forms of yoga.\n\nSunday 19 October 2025\n10:30am - 12pm\nCentral Rugby Club, 34 Lansdown Street, Mayfair\n$45 pp\n\nBookings Essential\nFollow the ticket link to reserve your space\nYour booking is confirmed once payment is made.\n\nhttps://kaelynnsofferings.as.me/schedule/8fa42429\n\n\nAbout Heidi\nI love holding spaces that feel like a deep exhale, where we can melt into Yin shapes, sip cacao, and let our whole system soften. My love is supporting people to feel good in their bodies and to remember that health can be both deeply healing and beautifully simple.\n\n\nAbout Kae-Lynn\nHello I\u2019m Kae-Lynn!\n\nI lead The Movement because, I believe everyone deserves a non judgmental space to catch their breath and, be reminded of their spark.\n\nWhen Mel first shared The Movement with me I was so I was burnt out, numb, and deeply disconnected. I was busy trying to love and please everyone else that I completely lost myself.\n\nDuring my first class something shifted. The music \u2014 the movements \u2014 Reminded me of that spark within me. It felt like my soul finally had permission to shine again. For that one hour, I could breathe. No pressure, no expectations, no noise from the world or my mind. Just movement, music, and freedom to be me.\n\nI believe fitness should be intentional, empowering and fun.\n\nCome give it a go!\n\n",

However, if you\u2019re currently in recovery, this can be extremely healing, and help you discover the deeper patterns that gave rise to this addiction.

That life is a series of tasks, a pursuit of pleasure, or a race for self-improvement that never really satisfies? This isn't just a feeling; it's a fundamental human question about what it means to exist.\n\nDescription\nJoin experienced psychotherapist Rohit Grover for a six-week course that invites you to look beyond the surface of everyday life. In these two-hour sessions, we will explore the core tenets of existential therapy, moving away from the conventional focus on self and hedonism. Instead, we'll grapple with life's big questions:\n\nWhat does it truly mean to live a value-driven life?\nDo our personal values matter, or is the search for meaning just an illusion?\nWhat is the \"being\" part of \"human being\" all about?\n\nThrough guided discussions, reflective exercises, and insights from classic existential thinkers, Rohit will help you navigate this profound territory. This isn't about finding easy answers. It's about developing the courage to ask the right questions, to confront the realities of freedom, responsibility, and meaning, and to discover a more authentic way of living.\n\nThis course is for anyone ready to step off the treadmill and begin a deeper exploration of what it means to be alive. Come and find out what it means to truly exist\n\nUpon completion of this course, participants will be able to:\n\nDifferentiate between a life driven by external pressures or fleeting pleasures and one rooted in personal values and authentic meaning.\n\nIdentify and critically examine the core existential givens of human existence, such as freedom, responsibility, isolation, and the search for meaning.\n\nArticulate a personal understanding of what it means to \"be\" a human being, moving beyond a purely functional or biological definition.\n\nArrive at sensing rather than thinking. Sensing this existence, this dance of life. Widen your view of existence.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

    "description": "Inner infrastructure for Outer Resilience, In times of polycrisis and uncertainty, more people are coming around to the need not for more information, but for integration and presence.\nThis 90-minute session offers a safe, grounded space to slow down, reconnect with ourselves, and explore the inner terrain of change-making, and of our relational space.\nAs Rumi reminds us: \u201cYesterday I was clever and tried to change the world; today I am wise and am changing myself.\u201d\nBuilding our inner infrastructure - our relationship with self, with our feelings, with others and with nature - is foundational to how we show up in the world.\nWe will begin by discussing research into how distraction or numbing our discomfort is an intelligent and common short-term survival strategy, but in fact is one which limits our long-term capacity to connect, lead and evolve. We will then guide participants in somatic practices to offer accessible ways to reconnect with your agency.\nDuring this session, you will gain tools to increase your inner awareness, expand your bandwidth of awareness, and integrate emotion, sensation, and story. Together we\u2019ll explore the role of perception in our orientation to life and the choices we make, how our narratives can connect us with our agency, the power of curiosity, and dive into how our relational presence can often have more impact than our opinions.\nThis session is an invitation to restore connection, calm, and courage, to become more whole, more fully human, and more ready for what this moment is asking of us.\nAbout your host\nFreda is a curator, engagement practitioner, and connector, who works at the intersection of social change, community-building, and inner development. She is the Founder of the Goodlife Collective, which curates spaces that build connection, wellbeing and collective wisdom.\nDrawing on yoga teaching, somatic practices and adult development, Freda is interested in how we build our inner infrastructure - the capacity to work through discomfort, reconnect with our agency, and bring greater presence to relationships. Her background is in psychology, environmental-science and design, and she loves nerding out on ideas and conversations about unlocking our collective potential.",

    "description": "Katie Knowles PAM, Title:\nSelf-Disclosure of Sexual Dysfunction to Romantic Partners.\n\nAbstract:\nSexual dysfunctions (e.g., distress about levels of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain) are linked with poorer individual and relational wellbeing. Disclosing these dysfunctions to a romantic partner helps to mitigate these effects, however, such disclosures also risk rejection or relationship conflict. Existing models of disclosure do not adequately capture the complexities of disclosing sexual dysfunction, such as how costs and benefits are weighed simultaneously, the role of contextual factors, or how partner responses shape future disclosures. Three studies test a model of people\u2019s disclosure of sexual dysfunction. Study 1 reports a thematic analysis of people\u2019s social scripts about disclosing sexual dysfunction. Subsequent studies will test the influence of positive and negative partner responses and develop a scale to measure the anticipated costs and benefits of disclosing dysfunctions. Altogether, these studies build a framework explaining how and when people will disclose sexual dysfunction to romantic partners.\nPrimary supervisor: Dr Matt Hammond\nSecond supervisor: Dr Ally Gibson\nStaff and postgraduate students are cordially invited to attend. There will be an opportunity at the end of the presentation for audience to observe the panel questioning the candidate about the presentation and proposed research, and for audience members themselves to ask questions of the candidate.\n",

There\u2019s no expectation to speak \u2014 your presence alone is valued. The circle follows a respectful, non-judgmental format, prioritizing safety, confidentiality, and authenticity.\n\nOptional Plant-Based Dinner\nAfter the circle, stay for a wholesome plant-based dinner and dessert ($15). Sharing a meal is a simple way to extend the sense of community and connection.

That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. Over the years, Andre has come to value the power of sitting in circle\u2014of men coming together in honesty, vulnerability, and presence to witness and support one another. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\n\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.",

Free from societal expectations of stoicism or self-sufficiency. Through open sharing and mutual support, participants are empowered to build resilience, self-reflection, and a stronger sense of identity and purpose.\nStructure of the Circle\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.A short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center. Only the personholding the object may speak, ensuring uninterrupted sharing.\nOpen Sharing: Anyone may choose to share while holding the object. Sharing is op-tional, and passing is always respected.\nActive Listening: While one person shares, others listen attentively without speaking,interrupting, or offering advice.

That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 05:45 PM\nArrive to Bhakti Lounge\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:45 PM - 07:15 PM\nMen's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\nHost: Andre\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:15 PM - 08:15 PM\nPlant-based dinner and dessert!\n\n\n",

    "description": "Relating in the Dark Wellington, Do you long to explore connection beyond the visuals?\nAfter a wonderful series of events in San Francisco, Portland, Amsterdam, Berlin & Edinburgh, Relating in the Dark is returning to Wellington for a special one-off evening this summer! Grab a blindfold and dive deep into the enriching practices of Authentic Relating, Movement Meditation & Conscious Touch.\nBy exploring intimacy without sight, we will delve into our intuitive nature, sharpening our capacity for deeper connection. We will use blindfolds to invite you into profound contact with your physical sensations and internal reality, unblocking your inhibition so as to reveal your truest essence.\nWHO is this event for?\nThis event is for anyone who is seeking deeper connection, stronger community, consensual loving touch, or simply a safe space to just be yourself.\nIf you\u2019re a curious, open, emotional human being and want to enhance your interpersonal relationships and enrich your self love within, this event is for you.\nThis event is also for you if you\u2019ve been recently feeling blocked, anxious, lacking purpose or direction, and need to reground and remind yourself what's truly important and who you truly are.\nMy experience includes working with Highly Sensitive People (HSPs); neurodiverse people; people suffering from anxiety and depression; people going through major life shifts; and members of the LGBTQ+ community.\nIf you have any questions about whether the event would suit you, pop me a message and I\u2019ll get back to you within 24 hours.\nWHAT will we explore?\nActivities will explore movement, contact and relating, with and without vision and words, by exploring the practices of Authentic Relating, Movement Meditation & Conscious Touch.\nAuthentic Relating is is a ground breaking social tool that enables you to playfully & courageously dive into open hearted connection, through radical honesty and active listening. The practice invites you to drop deeper into presence, embodied awareness and permission to express whatever is alive within you and the \u2018we-space\u2019 between you and other(s).\nMovement Meditation is free-form journey of authentic bodily flow. It invites you to surrender to what is arising in your body when deeply in connection with music, inducing a natural state of ecstasy.\nConscious Touch is the practice of bringing full attention and presence into relating physically to another person. In deeper awareness of our desires and boundaries, we will explore the many layers and dimensions of non-sexual touch.\nTogether, we will create a rich container to explore the many layers of our human experience, to invite loving, consensual touch, and arrive more deeply into present moment awareness.\nWHERE will it be?\nThe event will take place in the beautiful urban sanctuary of Wellington Meditation Centre, 31 Hobson Crescent, Thorndon, Wellington 6011.\nThe facilitator\nLaurie (he/him), is a queer British-Kiwi who\u2019s current home-base is Berlin. His passion is creating spaces that cultivate healthy, thriving human-to-human relationships, helping people take off their masks, feel their sensations and celebrate their aliveness on Earth. Since 2019, he has organised and facilitated hundreds of Authentic Relating, Dating and Embodiment workshops in Oceania and Europe.\nHis training includes The Embody Lab, Authentic Revolution, Body Electric, World Peace Yoga School and Connection Institute.\nHe has facilitated at internationally acclaimed festivals such as Stretch and Ignite, and organisations such as ART International and Authentic Bay Area.\nHis workshops have sparked thousands of nourishing connections, turning many strangers into life-long friends. He looks forward to holding space for you!\nFor more information, check out itoiauthenticrelating.com.\nFor his insta, check out: @itoiauthentic.\nHere's what others have said about Laurie's workshops (blindfolded & more) :\n\"This was my absolute favourite authentic relating event. I can't wait for the next one. Removing the clutter and distraction and judgment from my eyes supported me to drop in immediately to my own other senses and hearing and connection with the other. It was incredible.\"\n~ Daniel\n\"What a wonderful event. The blindfolds encouraged me to stay present and in your body. It was a very sweet and safe space to learn and explore. The connections were very fulfilling. A rejuvenating and enjoyable evening indeed!\"\n~ Carrie\n\u201cIt seems funny to say it but I felt so \u2018seen\u2019 without being seen\u201d\n~ Esther\n\u201cI noticed that I was so much more present with myself, and was able to share parts that I would normally find it really hard to share\u201d\n~ Elliot\n\"I love Laurie\u2019s energy, wisdom, execution and light touch. I felt super safe to open up and connect while he was holding the space\"\n~ Tess\n\"I live with complex PTSD and anxiety so in the past I have really struggled to open up to people and build meaningful connections. Discovering these workshops has been a life changer and both my therapist and I are thrilled with how my confidence has blossomed in recent months. Laurie's time and generosity really means the world to me\"\n~ Sarah\nHOW MUCH will I invest?\n$35 - low income\n$45 - medium income\n$55 - high income\nWhy are tickets sold by income?\nIn order to make the event as accessible as possible, there are three ticket types available.

Whether you are single or partnered, whether your past experiences were harmonious or painful, each relationship reflects the inner dance of the masculine and feminine within us.\n\nThroughout history, these sacred energies\u2014Yin and Yang\u2014were meant to complement and support each other. Yet, distortions, suppression, and separation have created wounds that echo through generations. Many of us carry beliefs such as:\n\nMen cannot be trusted.\nWomen are not safe.\nLove must be earned.\n......\n\nRarely do we pause to sit with these wounds and meet the unhealed parts of our inner feminine and masculine. These energies may hold not only personal pain but also ancestral imprints passed down through time\u2014shaping the way we experience love and connection today.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f In this mini workshop, you will be guided through a shamanic journey to explore and heal your inner archetypes. Together, we will:\n\n\u2728 Release old wounds and limiting patterns carried by the inner feminine or masculine.\n\u2728 Make peace with the shadow side of our psyche.\n\u2728 Embody the wholeness of the Divine Masculine and Feminine within.\n\nWe will close our circle with a sacred forgiveness ritual, bridging the separation and returning to a state of balance, wholeness, and love.\n\nThis journey is open to everyone\u2014whether you are new to shamanic work or have walked this path before. All that is required is an open heart and willingness to connect deeply within.\n\n\ud83c\udf38 You\u2019ll leave with:\n\nA renewed sense of love and harmony within yourself.\nGreater balance between your inner masculine and feminine.\nA deeper connection to spirit, self, and the essence of oneness.\n\nEvent Details\n\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, September 21st\n\ud83d\udd52 3:00\u20136:00 pm\n\ud83d\udccd Lotus Yoga Centre \u2013 Sanctuary, Paraparaumu\n\ud83d\udcab Energy Exchange: $55 per person\n\ud83c\udf3f Limited to 12 participants\n\n\u2728What to bring:\nA water bottle, journal, cushion or blanket for comfort.\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Rides from Wellington may be arranged\u2014please contact me if needed.Contact: 0272541272\n\nAbout Your Guide - Fery Qiu\n\nI am a Shamanic Healer who is committed to the healing path that help people heal from the core of their being. From suicidal depression to shamanic path, my spirituality is not based on how many trainings, meditations, and ceremonies I have done, it\u2019s coming from a deep embodied experience to transform pain into wisdom and empowerment. The shamanic path is a way of being; we allow ourselves to go deeper within to connect all things that come from oneness. I loved my work, which has been proven to help people really change their lives. If you are curious about what this mini workshop could bring, having an open mind and open heart, you will be surprised by how much can be done just in this brief journey within.\n\n\n\nWith love,\nFery Qiu\n\n",

This workshop aims to help sapphic women and gender minorities find joy, freedom, and connection through somatic exercises that help you embody and embrace your queerness. You will leave feeling confident in your ability to take up space, tapped into your self-expression, and connected to the experiences of your sapphic community.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of what to expect:\n- Opening Exercise: Guided somatic movements to loosen up your body\n- Community Connection: Rotating conversations with other participants about queer embodiment\n- Yoga Flow: Creative 30 minute class to explore presence and connect to your self-expression\n- Guided Meditation: A relaxing combination of breathwork and visualisation to cultivate safety in your body\n- Closing Connection: Gentle and grounding partner stretches (optional) and group reflections\n\nNo prior experience with yoga or somatic exercises necessary! All you need to attend is an open attitude, a desire to connect with your body, and a willingness to share your experience with other sapphics. Yoga mats and all other props will be provided. While this workshop dives into your embodied expression of sapphic identity/sexuality, none of the content is sexual in nature and the small amount of physical touch with other participants is completely optional.\n\nThe workshop is facilitated by Megan Edwards, creator of Golden Hour Gigs and a 500CYT trauma-informed yoga teacher. This event is intended specifically for queer women and gender minorities. No TERFS no SWERFS.\n\nContent consideration: Because this workshop focuses on finding joy/pleasure/freedom in your body, it might not be suited for anyone experiencing intense dysphoria. With that said, you are welcome to explore discomfort and work on integrating challenging feelings. Megan is trained in movement techniques to lead you away from anything too activating and help you find safety in your body.\n\nAccessibility: Awhi Yoga Studios has an elevator and is wheelchair accessible. There are plenty of gender neutral bathrooms and cosy spaces to rest if you need a break from the workshop at any time.

During her music studies at university, she was introduced to taonga p\u016boro, and this sparked a personal journey of reconnection to te ao M\u0101ori and her own whakapapa. Following university, she lived in an ashram for several years where she was introduced to the wonderful practice of bhakti yoga. She now lives with her husband in the Wellington region, where they regularly participate in kirtan (mantra music meditation) at Bhakti Lounge.\n\nAlexandra is a sound healing practitioner devoted to nurturing healing in both mind and body. She believes that sound vibration holds the power to expand consciousness and restore harmony and balance in our lives. Her journey into sound healing began with the realization of how deeply sound vibration was affecting her psyche\u2014making her more mindful of the music she listens to and the intention it carries. Along the way, she has drawn inspiration from artists such as Deva Premal, The Flying Mystics, Stevin McNamara, and the Bhakti Lounge Kirtan. Their music has profoundly influenced her own sound healing practice, inspiring her to explore sound as a tool for transformation, connection, and inner peace.",

    "description": "Teaching Well - A supportive school for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), Growing attention to staff wellbeing has resulted in many workplace mental wellbeing initiatives. Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 20% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions. Post workshop consulting services such as mentoring the development of or reviewing a staff wellbeing plan can also be provided.\nPost Workshop Consult:\nSchools and Kuras have the option of a 90 minute consult with Barry in 2026 to review their staff wellbeing plan.\nAN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNING WITH INTERNATIONALLY RESPECTED AND AWARD WINNING MENTAL WELLBEING PRACTITIONER AND SUICIDOLOGIST, BARRY TAYLOR\nBarry has worked in mental wellbeing promotion and suicide prevention/postvention for 37 years at the local, national and international levels.  His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs.  He has worked extensively with schools both here and overseas supporting management and staff in the event of a suicide. He wrote the first suicide postvention guidelines for schools in 1990, developed the first national suicide prevention guidelines for schools in Australia in 1999 and reviewed and updated the NZ guidelines in 2010.\nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.  In recognition of his outstanding contribution to mental wellbeing and suicide prevention, he was awarded in 2016 the NSW Mental Health Commissioner's Community Champion Award.\nBarry has lectured on wellbeing both nationally and internationally and been appointed to numerous government advisory committees on mental wellbeing and suicide prevention.  He brings to this workshop extensive experience in advising communities and government on post-disaster recovery in terms of both mental wellbeing promotion / community resiliency and suicide prevention.\nAs a Health Sociologist and Public Health practitioner, Barry has a long-term interest in the social and cultural determinants of wellbeing, especially the role of gender and he brings a wealth of knowledge and passion for promoting wellbeing in men. He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing. He uses a population health and systems change approach, drawing on transformational change theory and collective impact.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to promote well wh\u0101nau, workplaces and communities and for the incorporation of wellbeing principles in public policy and social outcomes such as education, training and employment.\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

    "description": "Teaching Well - Supportive schools for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), With the growing emphasis on staff wellbeing there is a plethora of workplace mental wellbeing programmes on offer. However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages. In fact, the staff consultation is, in itself, is a wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 30% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions.

His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs. \nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.

He wrote the first national guidelines for suicide prevention in Australian schools and undertook a review of the NZ guidelines.\nAs a Health Sociologist and Public Health practitioner, Barry has a long-term interest in the social and cultural determinants of wellbeing, especially the role of gender and he brings a wealth of knowledge and passion for promoting wellbeing in men. He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing. He uses a population health and systems change approach, drawing on transformational change theory and collective impact.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to promote well wh\u0101nau, workplaces and communities and for the incorporation of wellbeing principles in public policy and social outcomes such as education, training and employment.\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

Most props are provided but feel free to bring your own yoga mat for extra comfort as well as a cushion, blanket, socks and an eye pillow if you have one.\n\nThis class is suitable for all - no previous experience is required.\n\nLIMITED SPACES AVAILABLE.\nTWILIGHT SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/5a2pad44\nMORNING SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/mw82z38u\n\nRestorative yoga is a practice of deep relaxation in which yoga poses (asanas) are held for several minutes with the use of props such as blocks, bolster and blankets to support the body in gentle stretch.\n\nWhen your body enters a state of relaxation, your mind will also relax. Once you have been guided to let go of any tension held in your body, all that is required is for you to pay attention to your breath, becoming aware of any thoughts that may arise, and then gently releasing them.\n\nThis restful practice calms both mind and body, allowing the nervous system to enter its parasympathetic state \u2013 the state of \u201crest and digest\u201d, in which healing is enabled and enhanced.\n\nAbout Cacao\nCacao is a superfood. It is plant medicine at its finest. Its scientific name, Theobroma cacao, translates to \"food of the Gods.\" Containing many minerals, vitamins and phytonutrients such as flavonoids and antioxidants, it is also an extremely potent adaptogen that encourages the body to come into balance.\n\nCacao has a particularly strong influence on the heart \u2013 both physiologically and energetically. Cacao anecdotally is reported to enhance connection in community, hence its beauty in being shared in circle.\n\nIn Jenny's experience, cacao seems to enhance whatever it is that you are doing \u2013 be it running a marathon or meditating \u2013 cacao can make you go deeper, further, longer, stronger. However she does seem to have a mind of her own so be open to the experience she offers you \u2013 it may not always go quite how you planned!\n\nCacao is very safe and tolerated well by most people. However it is to be used with caution by people who are taking high doses of SSRIs. Cacao releases serotonin, so it works as a mild antidepressant. When taken with SSRIs that release serotonin chemically it can lead to serotonin syndrome. Individuals taking MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should avoid consuming ceremonial cacao due to potential interactions.\n\nThis workshop is part of Pukerua Bay Hub's 2025 Pop-up Parlour - thanks for your support.\n\n____________________________________\nWHAT IS THE POP-UP PARLOUR?\nA chance to create and connect in our pop-up community space.

We were also making experimental attempts into the world of radio, with the birth of Mouthfull\u2019s first international streaming server, playing music 24/7 (also live events a few times a week).\nIf we travel even further back in time, 2017 was the debut of the \u201cMouthfull Radio\u201d episodic series (~20eps) - but we consider the ongoingness the real thing to celebrate.\nMoving towards present day ~ through a vast richness of hosts, events, music, shows, zines, selectors, connections, pop ups, and story-times. It is a real joy to help community contemporary radio ripple out from this Pacific Island nation to the world wide web.\n\n5 Years goes so fast, and so we shall honour this time with a great celebration in the capital city of Aotearoa!

Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",

    "description": "Book Group: Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Do you keep meaning to read more of the great classics of literature? At Wellington Classic Literature Group we read novels that have stood the test of time, whether they were written in 1780, 1880 or even 1980. The group has been running for more than a decade and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers that come along for particular books or simply when it suits. We meet on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nOur October book is Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly. The work changed American hearts and minds about slavery.\n\nThe influence of Uncle Tom's Cabin was so immense that the story arose that when Abraham Lincoln welcomed Stowe to the White House during the American Civil War he reportedly declared, \"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\"\n\nIn the US, it was the best-selling novel of the 19th century and the second best-selling book of all after the Bible.\n\nProject Gutenberg link for those e-reading:\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/203\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place. After you enter the bar, head to your right (up the step) and through a smaller space with booths to the large carpeted space beyond.",

    "description": "F*ck the Small Talk: Wellington #9, Sign up here: https://luma.com/ftstwellington9\nF*ck the Small Talk has traveled the world from Berlin, Melbourne, London, Lisbon, and Mexico City, to Lisbon and is now coming to Wellington!\n\nWHAT'S THIS ABOUT?\nFTST is a one-of-a-kind social experience where strangers come together for an afternoon of meaningful, fun, and deep conversation. It\u2019s also just a different & cool way of meeting new people by getting a bit out of your comfort zone and skipping the small talk!\nJoin us for games, talks, and connections with friends you haven\u2019t met yet. Join if you get annoyed after being asked what you do, where you are from, and how long you have been in Wellington every single time you meet someone. If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll never have to speak in public if you don\u2019t want to!\n\nHOW TO JOIN?\nTake 2 minutes to fill out our form\n\nhttps://luma.com/ftstwellington9\nOur events are limited to 30 handpicked guests to ensure a cozy atmosphere. We prioritize a balance in gender and cultural diversity, making each gathering a unique blend of perspectives! If you're invited you'll receive an invite with a special link via our ticketing platform Luma\n\nHOW MUCH IS IT?\nThe cost to attend is NZD 23 (early llama) - NZD 25 (general llama) and includes the following:\n3 hours of facilitated and curated activities\nLight snacks to keep the energy going (only if outdoors)\nA space to meet new people in the least boring way possible\nSupporting our mission to slowly eliminate small talk around the world\nAlso includes those pesky ticket fees!\n\nWHERE IS IT?\nWe host our events in awesome cafes, rooftops, and bars across the city. We only reveal the location to ticket holders 24 hours before the event.\n\nWHAT THEY SAY\n\u201cGreat way to connect with people in a more meaningful way. Get to the heart of the matter, dive straight into what really counts!\u201d - Matthias\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of activity humanity needs every weekend. Thank you for all.\u201d - Sonya\n\n\u201cF*ck the Small Talk changes the narrative from \"Where are you from?\" to \"When was the last time you laughed uncontrollably?\" and I think that's beautiful.\u201d - Monika\n\n\u201cI loved F*ck the small talk, I was a little bit nervous at first but they are pros at making you feel comfortable with the rest of the group, the activities are really fun and I enjoyed every second (consider that the one who's saying this is very, very shy). Give it a try!\u201d - Brenda\n\n\"it\u2019s a wonderful experience, it\u2019s like being a kid again, when you were at the park, playing with other kids, and just decided you were going to be best friends for the next hours. Maybe you\u2019ll never see those kids again. But that hour was amazing because you both opened up and trusted each other.\" - Sara\n\n\u201cLively, interesting, introspective, completely open and no judgement. Everyone that joined was ready for great conversation and helped with different perspectives. So much fun! I can't wait for the next one! \u201c - Yaz\n\nCheck out our 100+ Google reviews: https://goo.gl/maps/TpZy77bfPFkGoikn7\n\nFAQ\n\u2022 Can I come alone?\nOf course, in fact, we encourage it! 99% of people do.\n\n\u2022 I signed up but never got an invite.

    "description": "Inner Marlborough Sounds Kayak Trip, Inner Marlborough Sounds Kayak Trip\n\n\nHi this is a trip through the Inner Marlborough Sounds, suitable for beginners who have gone to at least one SKISL and be OK with rescues. The focus is on camping, coffee, and having a fun time with relatively short kayaking times on the water.\n\nThe schedule for Wellingtonians is: on the Thursday 29th Ferry over to Picton, in at 12:30, launch from Picton beach head over to Kumoto, tents up, Friday - paddle around the Bay of Many Coves, stop for coffee / lunch / chips / shower at Punga Cove, stay at Camp Bay. Maybe a quick trip over to Bumine Island with empty boats. Saturday night at Ratimira for camping / snoozing. Sunday - up early, on water at 8am, paddle back to Picton in by 12, lunch, on 1pm sailing. So 4 days with Blumine as an optional paddle, mostly shortish trips. We might shift the plan around depending on the weather, but that sets out the general plan.\n\nFor the ferry you need to book your own tickets and I would urge you to get your ferry tickets now as they go fast. If you are concerned about the weather get the fully refundable tickets. When you buy your ticket select the \"kayak\" option. Any questions ask them in the comments below.\n\n",

You can view the picturesque Rangitikei River below as it flows past the high sandstone cliffs.\n\nLeaving National Park we then travel down one of the rail wonders of the world, the Raurimu Spiral. This magnificently engineered piece of railway, steeped in history with stories of how an engineer with courage, foresight and a brilliant ability overcame one of the most challenging railway engineering assignments of the last century.\n\nhere are two options once you get to Taumarunui, a bus tour to Omaka Lodge or the Taumarunui Rail Action Centre.\n\nThe bus departs the Taumarunui railway station at 12.30 for Omaka Gardens and will be back at the station by 2.30pm. A pop-up caf\u00e9 will be available for you to enjoy lunch while out at Omaka and you will have 3 acres of country excellence to explore at your leisure.\nRoses will be in bloom and the rhododendrons in flower. There is even a garden for your wedding hour. There are fantastic views and vistas over the forgotten world.\n\nhttps://www.omakalodge.nz/ https://gardenstovisit.co.nz/private-gardens/omaka-lodge/\n\nIncluded are transfers and entrance to the garden for your self-guided tour. Additional guided tours cost an additional $5.00 \u2012 please pay to the hosts.\n\nWhen you buy your train ticket you can choose a shuttle bus that will take you Taumarunui Rail Action Centre where you can view their model railway, trucks, jiggers, tractors and carriages. A hidden little gem, operated by the Taumarunui Rail Action Centre.\n\nIf you do not want to take a bus you may wish to visit the railway museum (on the platform) where you can wander down memory lane, or visit the town shops just across the road from the station.\n\nAt 2.45 pm it\u2019s \u201cAll aboard\u201d for our return journey to friendly Palmerston North!\n\nThis train will be hauled by a KiwiRail diesel locomotive.\n\nWhen Sunday 23rd November 2025\nDepart Palmerston North 8.30 am\nDepart Marton 9.10 am\nArrive Taumarunui 12.10 pm\nDepart Taumarunui 2.45 pm\nArrive Marton 5.55 pm\nArrive Palmerston North 6.30 pm\n\nAdult fare to Taumarunui $180\nAdult fare with side trip Omaka Lodge Garden $202.50\nAdult fare and Taumarunui Rail Action Centre $193",

And don\u2019t forget \u2013 there are spot prizes for the fiercest looks, so bring your best Leather or Lace fantasy.\n\nWho\u2019s it for?\nCoven is a celebration crafted exclusively for queer women and gender minorities. Whether you\u2019re sapphic, trans, nonbinary, genderqueer \u2013 this is your night to shine.\n\nEvening Highlights:\n- 7pm Cocktail Hour: Fabulous arrival photos, sip on our sexy drink specials and soak in the vibes with live sapphic music.\n- An evening of entertainment from burlesque, to the kinkier kind, and flash tattoos by an incredible local artist\n- Our infamous dessert grazing table\n\nTickets are strictly limited \u2013 and they WILL sell out. Secure yours now and don\u2019t miss the queer event everyone will be talking about.\n\nComing Solo? You\u2019re Not Alone.\nDon\u2019t be nervous if you\u2019re planning to come on your own \u2013 Coven is built for connection. Whether it\u2019s your first queer event or your hundredth, you\u2019ll be surrounded by a community that gets it. From the moment you arrive, there\u2019ll be friendly faces, welcoming vibes, and plenty of chances to mingle, and connect. Coven is about belonging \u2013 and there\u2019s a place here for you.\n\nCoven Kaupapa\nFor queer women and gender minorities, spaces like this are rare, vital, and sometimes, life-changing. In a world that constantly centers cishet norms, Coven offers a space where we are the default \u2013 where you can fully show up as yourself, be seen, celebrated and surrounded by YOUR community.\n\nFor many in our Coven, this is one of the only opportunities we feel comfortable enough to experience nightlife free from the male gaze, tokenism, fear, or the need to shrink ourselves to fit in. It\u2019s a space where sapphic, trans, nonbinary, and gender-diverse people aren\u2019t just welcomed \u2013 we are centered. It\u2019s for those who are often pushed to the margins, who rarely feel represented in \u201cinclusive\u201d spaces that still cater to the mainstream.\n\nThis night exists because we need it \u2013 and because we create it, together.\n\nAccessibility\nThe event is held upstairs at Whisky & Wood, a stunning venue with gender-neutral bathrooms and lift access (note there is a small bump as you enter). Staff will be ready to help if needed. Have specific accessibility needs? Reach out directly at hello@whiskyandwood.co.nz.\n\nCommunity Tickets\nWe want Coven to be for everyone. At checkout, consider donating toward our community ticket fund. Can\u2019t afford a ticket? Email willysmackntush@gmail.com with the subject \u201cFree for Me\u201d and your preferred name. We\u2019ll be gifting free tickets on Friday 18 October.\n\nIf you made it this far... Good girl / Good they / Good boy / Good YOU!\nGet ready for a night of queer joy, sexy surprises, and community magic.",

    "description": "The Eras Tour | The Final Show: A Swiftie Birthday Screening For a Cause, This email was sent to any current ticket holders, check your spam folder!\nKia ora! \nWe have an update on the eras tour movie we need to share with you. In the past East Coast releases have meant a Friday 5pm release for us in New Zealand, which would have been fine for our Saturday screening of the FINAL SHOW (trailer here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1MO3bRG9qw). \nHowever it seems Disney has just released that it will stream from 9pm EST, which is 3pm on Saturday here! So we have tossed and turned the last 24 hours as to what to do! The choices boiled down to the old movie on Saturday or the new one the following day (the Penthouse kindly is able to accommodate either). Since many of us are excited about the new one AND it won't be showing on a big theatre screen we have made the call to move to Sunday, 14th December, 1pm. \nNow, we recognise this is a change of plan that might affect you. If you cannot make it and would like a refund, that is absolutely fine, this should be a function on Humantix you can pursue (or else email me at evaneely@live.com). \nWe do hope that you can still join us though! We have a giant Taylor birthday cake planned (in the States it will be her birthday when we get together!), goodie bags with Taylor tattoos, stickers and bookmarks, and three awesome spot prizes (Showgirl acoustic CD, an awesome new 1000 piece Taylor puzzle, 2026 Taylor calendar). \nWe'd also LOVE if you could share the link with family & friends, we still have some tickets to sell and would love to raise the funds, and have a fantastic dance party vibe with you. (https://events.humanitix.com/the-eras-tour-movie-a-swiftie-birthday-screening-for-a-cause)\nApologies for this hick up and change of plan. Mara broke her foot 3 weeks ago and has had surgery, so we are getting used to pivoting and changing plans this summer. We appreciate your understanding! \nThanks for supporting Mara, she is excited to still have her birthday weekend, even with a non functioning foot and some time changes! \nMuch love, Eva & Mara\nEVENT OVERVIEW:\nCalling all swifties! Come along to a fun, action packed, dress up, sing-along on Taylor's birthday on December 13th. A one time screening only, of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour Movie at Penthouse cinema. There are three ticket price options to pay, Budget Swiftie, Generous Swiftie, Big Spender Swiftie. Each ticket gives you the same access, its just about how much you want to donate. Every ticket also comes with a Taylor Swift themed goodie bag. All of the funds will go to supporting families and children in need in Palestine through Aotearoa 4 Gaza. So ...Are you ready for it?\nThere will be a Taylor birthday cake, goodie bags and a few Swiftie spot prizes!\nInformation about cause:\nThe Aotearoa 4 Gaza mutual aid fund was set up last year to directly support families in Gaza. We are a grassroots collective based in Aotearoa standing in unwavering solidarity with Palestinian families in Gaza. Through consistent, direct mutual aid, we send $100 at a time (usually once a week) to families who are living through unimaginable hardship under Israel's occupation and genocide. These contributions go straight to verified recipients, without intermediaries, ensuring urgent support reaches those who need it most. The fund is fully volunteer run and is led by Emily Writes. Nobody takes a cut. Every cent goes to our families. Every donation is a lifeline, and a stand against violence and genocide. We invite you to contribute, to share, and to stand with us in this act of collective care and resistance.",

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

Through his wanderings, Alex has picked up a finely crafted, rootsy songwriting style with thought provoking lyrics and a flare for acoustic guitar finger picking. His influences range from blues, pop and the British folk revival guitarists, but his sound is all his own. He has a growing reputation as a solo performer, having performed around the UK, Ireland, Italy, Germany and Spain.\n\nJon Sanders is recognised as a virtuoso bouzouki player, tenor ukulele player, drop D and DADGAD guitarist and an internationally acclaimed composer. His compositions draw on elements of jazz, gypsy, funk, Arabic, Latino and Celtic styles, somewhat reminiscent of Sylvain Luc, Pierre Bensusan, Antonio Forcione and James Hill - yet instantly different.\n\nBoth were based in Dingle in Kerry, but in different scenes. But only later on started playing in the UK first at the Didsbury Festival, then did couple of other festivals and it went down really well\u2026 the chemistry of the duo, complementing each other with symbiotic dynamism, with sensitivity in each others music. Both are long time professional musicians. Jon has been performing in NZ for 20 years, however this is Alex\u2019es first time in NZ.",

This series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\nEach of the evenings will bring a different electronic vibe, conjured by some of Wellington\u2019s most innovative artists. The series lineup includes:\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\nTickets are available from Wednesday 18 June, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\nAbout the Artists\nLudus\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\nStephen Gallagher\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\nDavid Long\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\nJules Desmond\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\nOghum\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\nJess Chambers\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration.

Once you register, you'll receive an acknowledgement from Humanitix, followed by a second email directly from the Holocaust Centre of New Zealand.\n2025 Annual Kristallnacht Commemorative Concert\nEscape & Exile \u2013 East & West\nJoin the Holocaust Centre of New Zealand for a poignant evening of remembrance and reflection. The Te K\u014dk\u012b Trio, featuring Inbal Megiddo (cello), Martin Riseley (violin), and Jian Liu (piano), will be joined by Professor Kim Cunio, Head of Te K\u014dk\u012b / New Zealand School of Music, in a powerful performance commemorating Kristallnacht.\n This concert commemorates Kristallnacht, or \u201cThe Night of Broken Glass,\u201d the horrific pogroms of 9\u201310 November 1938, across Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland. This state-sponsored violence saw the murder of an estimated 91 Jews, the arrest of 30,000, and the destruction of hundreds of synagogues and Jewish businesses. Kristallnacht is widely regarded as a pivotal moment, marking the escalation of Nazi persecution and often described as the beginning of the Holocaust.\n The Nazis sought to silence the music and art of all those they deemed \"untermenschen,\" including six million Jews and other victimised groups. This concert stands as a powerful act of defiance and remembrance, allowing us to hear the voices of those who were murdered, forced into hiding, or exiled. It celebrates their artistic brilliance and ensures their memory lives on.\n This year's theme is \"Escape and Exile: East and West.\" In the tradition of paying musical tribute to all victims, we will honour the music of Jewish composers from across the globe\u2014from the Netherlands and Nazi-occupied Germany in the West, all the way to Iraq and Shanghai in the East.\n The programme will feature pieces that honour:\nErna Weiss Falk, a talented Jewish opera singer from Cologne, whose promising career was cut short by anti-Jewish laws. She and her family ultimately escaped to the Netherlands.\nBrigitte Schiffer, a young composer who completed her doctorate in Berlin before fleeing the Nazis to Egypt, where she became the director of the Higher Music Education Institute for women.\nThe Al Kuwaiti brothers, Jewish pioneers of modern Iraqi music, survived the Farhud, a devastating pogrom inspired by Nazi ideology that targeted Baghdad's Jewish population on June 1-2, 1941, coinciding with the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. Despite their legacy resonating across the Middle East through radio, their contributions were erased from Iraqi history.\nFerdinand Adler, a Hungarian Jewish violinist who miraculously escaped from the Dachau concentration camp, to Shanghai.\n Join us for this important event as we mourn the lives lost and celebrate the resilience of the human spirit. We look forward to welcoming you.\n Details:\nWellington: Sunday, 9 November 2025\nAuckland: Monday, 10 November 2025\nDoors Open: 6:00 PM\nConcert Begins: 6:45 PM\nLocation: To Be Announced\n Please RSVP by Monday, 3 November 2025, to let us know if you can join us.",

Saturday 13th of December, the band will take the stage at Auckland\u2019s glorious Hollywood Avondale for an all-ages show, playing Meow in Wellington on Sunday 14th December.\n\nAfter bursting onto the scene with two incredible albums in a single year - the brilliant Tracey Denim and the noisy niceness of The Twits - bar italia spent the next while earning a reputation as one of the best live bands in the game, including a sold out and sweaty show at Auckland\u2019s Neck of the Woods. Since then, the band have been plotting their next move in world domination, dropping fan favourite single Cowbella in June, and this week lifting the lid on Some Like It Hot with accompanying tune Fundraiser - with a video featuring Matt \u201cSuper Hans\u201d King.\n\nThe London based band, built around the core of Nina Cristante, Jezmi Tarik Fehmi and Sam Fenton, may have looked to be hiding out this year while cooking up this new batch of tunes, but in reality they\u2019ve been anything but dormant. Cristante teamed up with Yves Tumor for a dangerously good duet on We Don\u2019t Count, while Jezmi and Sam dropped another full-length album under their Double Virgo moniker just last month.\n\nWith the album dropping on Matador this October, local fans will have a couple of short months to learn the words and get ready to scream and swoon along when bar italia hit our shores this December.

The time has finally come to celebrate the release of the Bri Louise Album.\nRogue & Vagabond on 24th of January.\n\nElly Mae and her band will be opening up before the Bri Louise Band takes the stage. The night will also feature some very special friends of ours, including Keira Batten-Copgan, Felix Hilton, Leji, Gala Baumfield, Meihana McGee, the Bri Louise Choir, and the Bri Louise Jazz Orchestra.\n\nHeres a few words about the two bands if you arnt acquainted with them:\n\nBri Louise blends sultry queerness with smooth love and undeniable groove. Rooted in gospel and neo-soul, their sound expands into a rich fusion of jazz, hip-hop, and R&B. Poetic lyricism is supported by a tight live band that features colourful keys, phatty bass, flashy beats, vibrant guitar, and fruity woodwinds. We will be joined by many guests but our core features Bri Louise (vocals/keys), Molly Wyatt (flute/vocals), Becky Devine (bass), Theo Thompson (guitar), Eloise Edmonds (saxophone), and Jonathan Stolk (drums).\n\nElly Mae crafts songs that encapsulate the bittersweet ache of growth, the quiet unraveling of time, and the soft glow of nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, indie, shoegaze, and anything in between. From lullabies that make you feel weightless to being wrapped in a blanket of sound, Elly Mae\u2019s folk/country melodic guitar style is accompanied by experimental, spatial bass from Arran Cargill-Brown and textured pocket drumming from Sasha Francis-Murray.\n\nCome celebrate this very special night and the release of this cool project with us.\nTickets available via UTR.

    "description": "Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour, Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour\nIndie-Folk Artist Colette Rivers and her band will be performing her intimate new album, The Backyard Wonder.\n\nIndependent artist Colette Rivers is releasing her second full-length album, The Backyard Wonder, an intimate exploration of healing, change, and the quiet beauty of ordinary moments.\n\nThis album holds special meaning for Rivers: after being diagnosed with cancer in July 2023, her planned sophomore release had to take a back seat to recovery. But when the cancer returned in early 2025, she felt compelled to finish and release the album, not just as a legacy project, also as a celebration after hard times, with a focus on how \u201cyou can find the wonder in life, even in your backyard.\u201d\n\nA lifelong creative, Rivers records, mixes, and produces in her home studio in Masterton, and plays every instrument heard on The Backyard Wonder. Her debut album, Memory Lake (2020), was shaped by early years spent in the US, and her move to Taup\u014d at age 11; this was followed by a nationwide tour. Now based in the Wairarapa and working as a secondary school drama teacher, Rivers continues to move between solo performance and full band sets, while staying rooted in the acoustic traditions that define her sound.\n\nWith her right arm partially paralysed following recent treatment, Rivers has gathered a group of close friends to help bring the songs of The Backyard Wonder to life (especially its intricate fingerpicking parts) for a run of live shows. She\u2019ll be touring the Wellington and Wairarapa regions from August through October, finishing with a set at the Wellington Folk Festival.\n\nFor updates, and behind-the-scenes glimpses, visit www.coletteriversmusic.com or follow @colettemusic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nOpening for Rivers are artists:\n\nPhil Masters\nPhil Lively-Masters is an experienced, well travelled singer songwriter who specialises in writing the sort of Sun Kissed West Coast Laurel Canyon Americana that made Neil Young, Stephen Stills and the Byrds famous. With a powerful, honey soaked voice that has won praise and support slots from legendary American country rock pioneers like The Jayhawks and original cosmic cowboy Steve Young, Phil has 20 years worth of road worn original songs to pull on, including tracks from the critically acclaimed CANYON RYDE album 'Free To Be' and some choice country rock covers to weave a spell on any listener.\n\nSaali Marks\nA singer, songwriter, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, Saali Marks hails originally from the\nSouth Island, but has made Wairarapa his home for the last 20 years, where he lives on a farm\nwith his family and teaches music at Kuranui College.\nSaali has played in numerous bands over the years, in a wide range of styles from proto-punk\nto psychedelic dub, covers, originals and fully improvised music with no discernible genre, on\nstages throughout Aotearoa since 1991. Currently he fronts the Wellington ska band Battleska\nGalactica.\nThroughout and alongside it all Saali has indulged his love for songwriting and solo\nperforming, developing a unique style, rooted in folk and blues, and inspired by greats from\nacross the decades. A skilled guitarist, Saali rarely plays straight ahead chords, and an\neducation in jazz has informed his ear for harmony, the beauty of dissonance, tension and\nresolution, with unconventional song structures, alternate tunings and intriguing melodies.\nAlthough not adverse to penning the odd love song, most of Saali\u2019s lyrics tend to focus on\nother aspects of the human condition, from religion and politics to our relationships with the\nenvironment and our own minds.\n\n",

The album drops 19 September on streaming & vinyl.\n\nNever overblown or overproduced, Dreams That Feel Like Falling is direct and intimate. 11 tracks of warmth, sincerity and brashness that strike a balance of breeze and overdrive.\n\nTo celebrate the release, Cowboy Dan are heading out for a run of shows throughout Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui in September and October.\n\nThis Te Whanganui-a-Tara will be the second outing in the capital for Cowboy Dan, who are delighted to bring Echo Children along for the ride from T\u0101maki to share their special tunes and infectous harmoines, along with Te Whanganui-a-Tara local legends Search For Yeti...STACKED!\n\nOnce aptly described as The Bats on the right amount of Red Bull, Cowboy Dan has been treating audiences across the motu to energetic, emotionally charged tunes since 2015. Their live shows have consistently delivered good times to fans and new friends alike.\n\nOff the back of two delightful EPs: We Will Hesitate, When We Eventually Wait (2017, Mixed by Jonathan Pearce); Sentimental Now That We're Leaving (2021, Mixed by Rohan Evans), the debut LP, Dreams That Feel Like Falling, is a continuation and a few steps forward, showcasing the bands expansive sonic pallet, with a mix of distortion, introspection, heart and bite.\n\nSearch For Yeti draws from a deep range of influences to create a sound that achieves the difficult feat of being hugely atmospheric and diverse while also being hook laden. This is an act that captures people with their onstage energy \u2014 and gets them talking afterwards about the songs that they just heard.\n\nFollowing in the long tradition of innovative Aotearoa indie bands, Echo Children craft a distinctive sound by melding psychedelic pop harmonies with sharp alt-country songwriting.\n\nGather your pals and get ready for good times! A thursday, sure, but what a chance to digest some upbeat goodness hailing from the big smoke and with some local goodness to boot.\n\n",

Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre.

    "description": "Getdown Services - Australia & New Zealand 2026, Meet Getdown Services \u2013 your new favourite band and one of the UK\u2019s hottest word-of-mouth acts! The brilliantly offbeat cult British duo has been turning heads across Britain and Europe with their balls-to-the-walls live shows, tongue-in-cheek wit, razor-sharp lyrics and infectious disco-fuelled grooves, teetering between chaos and genius. And now, after selling out tours across the UK and Europe, they\u2019re bringing their riotous show down under for the first time in May/June 2026 \u2013 with shows in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Wellington, presented by I OH YOU and MG Live. \nTickets go on sale Friday 14 November at 10.00am local time, with MG Live presale commencing Thursday 13 November at 10.00am local time. Sign up for early access to the MG Live presale here.               \n\u201cI reckon we get people asking us to come to Australia probably every day, and everyone in England is moving there, so will be good to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\u201cAlways been one of those places where you\u2019re like, \u2018Fair enough, but I can\u2019t be arsed with that. It looks mad \u2013 there\u2019s snakes and also it takes 40 hours to get there.\u2019 Will be good fun, though! Went to New Zealand to see a mate of ours get married a few years ago and thought it was a lovely country and I really liked those pies they have. It felt quite similar to the UK in a lot of ways, so playing gigs there should be fun!\u201d\nGetdown Services\n\nFor those in the know, Bristol-based duo Josh Law and Ben Sadler \u2013 aka Getdown Services \u2013 are THE must-see new act of the year. And if you don\u2019t know yet, you will soon \u2026 and you\u2019ll wish you got in early! Named as \u201cone to watch\u201d at this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival and dubbed (by the band themselves) \u201cBritain\u2019s Best Band\u201d, their live shows are equal parts smart, sweaty and gloriously unhinged. Their sound is a wild blend of scrappy indie disco, twisted funk and post-punk energy, turning the absurdity of modern Britain into dancefloor gold.        \n \nThe pair met at school in Minehead, Somerset and now make music together at home in Bristol \u2013 churning out what Rolling Stone called \u201cpower disco with unrepentant silliness\u201d with a healthy dose of satire and swagger. Their highly lauded debut album Crisps (Breakfast Records, 2023) showcased their eclectic danceable grooves and biting social commentary, and a mix of sharp, funny social observations wrapped in irresistible, funk-fuelled rhythms. Follow-up EPs Your Medal\u2019s In The Post, Crumbs and latest, Primordial Slot Machine, cemented their cult status, alongside an arsenal of red-hot singles \u2013 including James Bay\u2019s Hat, Dog Dribble, I Got Views and Eat Quiche, Sleep, Repeat.   \n \n \u201cGetdown Services are unrepentantly silly and constantly deliver one of the most joyously deranged live shows \u2013 just one of the best live bands out there!\u201d\n Rolling Stone\n\u201cTheir live show is as daft and as exhilarating as they come. Five stars.\u201d\n Buzz Magazine\n \n \u201cGenuine contenders to being the most exciting and interesting band in the UK right now.\u201d\n CLASH\n\n Getdown Services look set to gobble up the world, one crumb at a time. Whether you\u2019re into danceable chaos, satirical genius or just want to be ahead of the curve, Getdown Services are the band you didn\u2019t know you needed \u2013 until now! Britain\u2019s favourite new band are about to become yours too! \n\nMG LIVE TERMS OF SALE\n\nhttps://mg.live/termsofsale",

He is known for his extraordinary ability to fuse deep blues grooves with the spiritual depth of Indian classical music. Switching effortlessly between slide guitar, harmonica, banjo, and the remarkable Mohan veena \u2014 a 20-stringed instrument taught to him by Indian master Vishwa Mohan Bhatt \u2014 Manx creates performances that are immersive, transportive, and deeply human.\n\u201cA seamless fit between blues and Indian classical music\u201d - DownBeat Magazine\n\u201cDeliciously addictive\" - The New York Times\n\u201cCanada\u2019s most expressive blues player\u201d - Billboard Magazine\n\ud83d\udccd Friday 03 April @ The Little Theatre - Lower Hutt\n7pm doors / 7:30pm show\nSeated Concert\n2 x 45 minute sets with intermission\n$59 Early Bird Tickets (very limited)\nDON'T miss your chance to see live music at it's finest!\n\n\u201cWatching Harry play tonight I feel like I learned something new \u2026. \u201d\nBruce Springsteen\nHarry Manx is an artist that critics have occasionally had a hard time getting their minds around. His unique amalgam of blues and other American roots music, classical Indian forms, and bits of rock, pop, and folk makes him difficult to pigeonhole, and self-appointed gatekeepers of those traditions sometimes bemoan his lack of purity, stubbornly missing the point. But Manx\u2019s trip is really quite easy to grasp: He\u2019s an accomplished and adventurous lap-slide guitarist \u2013 whether playing a National resonator, a solidbody lap-steel, a modified banjo or cigar-box guitar, or his signature 20-string Mohan Veena \u2013 and a compelling singer with a rich, warm, and soulful voice who writes intelligent and compassionate songs and puts them over with heartfelt conviction.\u201d\nBarry Cleveland, Guitar Player Magazine\n\nThere are concerts, and then there are rare musical gatherings that feel quietly profound. Harry Manx creates the latter. This is music that doesn\u2019t rush, doesn\u2019t shout, and doesn\u2019t rely on spectacle \u2014 instead, it invites you to listen deeply, feel fully, and leave changed. Audiences don\u2019t just attend a Harry Manx show; they experience it. These nights linger long after the final note fades, becoming the kind of concert people talk about for years. If you value artistry, atmosphere, and the rare magic that happens when a room truly listens, this is a performance you\u2019ll want to be part of.",

After a packed out EP launch last year for their EP On A Good Day, they are thrilled to be returning to Wellington Bluegrass Society at Abandoned Petone on Saturday 1st November. Their next dream is to record a full album of their original songs - perhaps on another good day in Wellington!\n\nHihi and The Stitchbirds are: Elena Saunders - vocals and vibes, Chris Goldsbury - guitar, clarinet and vocals, Tessa Luff - guitar, banjo ukulele and vocals, Matt Hutton - bass ukulele and vocals, and Ellie Stewart - fiddle and vocals.\n\nTwo acts will also perform on the night. First is Tessa Luff, who is the main song-writing powerhouse behind Hihi and The Stitchbirds.

In 2023 Louisa won the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award for her piece Dream Within A Dream, and in 2024 Louisa received a composition commission from the Wellington Jazz Festival and headlined the festival with the new work, The Chasm Where We Fall Into Each Other.  Louisa has worked with L.A.B, Bret McKenzie, AJA, The Rodger Fox Big Band, Royal NZ Air Force Band, Trinity Roots and Lord Echo.\n\n\"This commission opportunity has come at a perfect time for me to process some recent grief and pain that\u2019s inhabited my circles. Whilst composing this music, I\u2019ve thought about ideas around mental health, specifically with youth in Aotearoa, and also honouring some friends who have passed. I think artists have the ability to turn heartbreak into beauty, and this music is an attempt at that. Although the inspiration which generated the music is heavy, the performance itself will hopefully feel light and reflective (turning heartbreak into beauty = darkness into light!), and will embrace and celebrate the talents of the musicians who are playing.

The Orchestra is a national trailblazer in big band history and features New Zealand compositions, and a classic repertoire from the golden era of big band swing jazz of Ellington and Basie.\n\nThe band benefits from a depth of talent that most military bands around the world would only dream of and is made up of Wellington\u2019s most exceptional musicians.\n\n\u201cThe line-up will be a who\u2019s who of the Wellington jazz scene,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s a while since we had a big band at the festival, so we\u2019re elated to have the Airforce Jazz Orchestra back with us again.

A smoky, dimly lit room where the anticipation is electric but the vibe is laid-back and relaxed. . .\n\nFrom the stage a jazz swing and blues band begins to play, their instruments blending seamlessly in a harmonious symphony of sound. The rhythm section, with its upright bass and snare drums, lays down a groove that's impossible to resist, while the saxophone punctuates the air with soulful notes.\n\nAt. the forefront stands a captivating female singer, her voice rich and velvety, weaving tales of heartache, joy, and everything in between. Her vocal prowess brings both swing and blues to life, effortlessly moving from sultry, slow blues ballads to energetic, foot-tapping swing numbers.\n\nThis band doesn't just play music; they create an experience that transports the audience to another era, where the essence of jazz and blues reigns supreme.\n\nWelcome to an evening of superb swing jazz and blues brought to you by the band that is April\u2019s Fools. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely wrapt to be bringing this ultra-talented and experienced combo to the festival,\u201d says Music Director Lee Quayle. \u201cWhenever, and wherever this group of musicians have played reviewers have to search the thesaurus for new superlatives to describe the show, and audiences leave reluctantly, but happy.\u201d\n\nApril\u2019s Fools are April Phillips (vocals), Greg Crayford (drums), Zak Dikvert (guitar), Nicholas Bauke-Maunsell (saxophone), Miles Crayford (keyboards) and RoryMacartney (bass).

Since their 2020 debut, Te Whanganui-a-tara based indie rock/alternative band Extra Butter have evolved into a six piece ear treat consisting of vocals, saxophone, guitar, bass, keys and drums. The soundscape of Extra Butter provides sonic illustrations for a variety of scenarios from cicada season hangs in the backyard and sultry smoke filled speakeasies to gravel pits under peak heat and swamps with both treasures and tricks waiting to be found. The band\u2019s debut EP, Zephyr, released last year, offered the repertoire of the band\u2019s formative years. Their next releases are to be expected in the coming season, offering a smorgasbord of sounds. Drawing on the paradoxical complexities of relationships and the human condition, Extra Butter is an ever evolving unit of introspection as sound and performance.\nMamalouder!

The group is now actively\nworking towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\nRomi Wrights\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring\nstories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke\nfestival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release\nmid to late 2025.\n\n",

Sticking to the traditional one man band format, Chuck plays all the instruments simultaneously.\nCaptivating storytelling intertwines effortlessly with heart stopping harmonica. Multiple guitar styles are underpinned by his left and right feet frantically pounding the kick and hi hat. The listener is left simply wondering, \"How the hell does he do that\"?\nOriginally hailing from the UK, Li\u2019l Chuck has been stomping his music in NZ since 2003.\nLi'l Chuck has performed at many high profile events around New Zealand including opening for American legend Jimmy Buffet, Bluesman Jerron 'Blind Boy' Paxton and The Topp Twins, and festivals including Blues on Broadbeach, Gold Coast Australia, Dunedin and Wanaka Arts festivals, The Great Kiwi Beer festival, Canterbury folk festival and many more.\nUp to 2025, He has recorded 5 solo one man band records to great acclaim by international Blues publications.\nHis 2017 album Utility Blues hit No\u20196 on the official NZ albums chart & has twice been the feature artist on Jesse Mulligan's Radio New Zealand\u2019s Friday live.\nIn an age where we are rushing around at breakneck speed, where everything is instant, sugar coated, airbrushed and overly polished, Li\u2019l Chuck brings us down to earth with some organic, all natural, whole grain, naked goodness.\nDoors open 7pm for a 7.30pm start.",

    "description": "Make Some Noise - choral music that matters, After a successful performance of Mozart\u2019s classic Requiem in D Minor in May, Supertonic is back with a programme of contemporary choral music that matters. \nOn the evening of Saturday 8 November, Supertonic will present Make Some Noise at the Lower Hutt Town Hall. This is the first time the choir has performed in the Hutt Valley, and they hope to see some new faces in the audience as they bring this programme of  meaningful music from around the world to the stage.  \nMake Some Noise highlights issues of social justice, including indigenous, women\u2019s and civil rights and climate action. The programme is rich and varied, from Katerina Gimon\u2019s arrangement of AURORA\u2019s Apple Tree, a Norwegian pop song addressing the urgency of the global climate crisis, to Robert T. Gibson\u2019s arrangement of the gospel standard This Little Light of Mine. Oliassa by Malika Tirolien utilises an invented language to invoke a call from the ancestors, while Alex Vollant titles their piece Auass meaning \u201cchild\u201d in the Innu language to honour the generation of elders who survived the Residential Schools in Canada. The impact of sexual harassment and assault on women is highlighted in MILCK\u2019s I Can\u2019t Keep Quiet  and Lillia Ruocco and Emmanuelle Ader\u2019s Canzone r\u00f2 curtiell\u2019. Closer to home, Make Some Noise features a set of waiata in teo reo M\u0101ori to highlight the importance of indigenous voices in Aotearoa New Zealand, including Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s Whakarongo. This waiata-\u0101-ringa incorporates Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s beliefs and methodology on teaching te reo M\u0101ori.   \nLed by co-Musical Director Virginie Pacheco, Supertonic offers Make Some Noise as an invitation to concert-goers to consider the causes that are important to them. In connecting with audiences through the striking and impactful works of the composers featured in this programme - by turns harmonious, raucous, gut-wrenching, resolute - the choir hopes to inspire those listening to make some noise in their own lives. \nSupertonic was formed in 2014 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and strives to  push the boundaries of what choral music can be. The choir has performed concerts that cover the entire musical spectrum, from major classical works including Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Vivaldi's Gloria and Faure's Requiem to pop and rock spectaculars celebrating hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s from the likes of Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Elton John, Queen, and Celine Dion. The choir has performed alongside The Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, joined Brett McKenzie, the NZSO and The Muppets for the Jim Henson Retrospectacle,  shared the stage with Mama Kin Spender at Coastella, and performed in national civic commemorations, street festivals and at community events.",

He will also make a solo appearance at Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, where he joins He Manu T\u012boriori, a celebration of waiata reo M\u0101ori, on Saturday 21 March.\nAt the centre of Amber Skies is Muroki\u2019s drive for freedom and new experiences. He believes music only really happens when he is fully living, pushing into new environments, meeting people and adding what he calls seasoning to life. \nThe album was written and recorded between Aotearoa and Berlin, with production by Djeisan Suskov, Justyn Pilbrow and Josh Fountain, and featuring Len Blake and keyboard virtuoso Joe Kaptein. \nMuroki is immersed in the Berlin scene, regularly jamming with musicians including members of Parcels, Rikas and the Zen Men, finding grounding in a city that can be both electric and mellow. He filmed the video for latest single Break It Down in Portugal with director Ezra Simons (Earth Tongue), shot entirely on 16mm film in Peniche and Nazar\u00e9, and also returned to Kenya for the first time since he was sixteen, reconnecting with wh\u0101nau and gaining perspective during this chapter.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been bouncing between places while working on this album. Living nomadically keeps me open and curious. Nothing beats coming back to Aotearoa, and I can\u2019t wait to play these songs live with the band.\u201d\nWith platinum success on Wavy, the Triple J topping Love Cocoon with BENEE and collaborations with LEISURE, Young Franco and NASAYA, Muroki returns home ready to take these songs to the stage.",

The lyrics paint loathsome, frightening images of pitch-black self-hatred and the frailty of the human experience. These musical manifestations only serve to cement their already legendary status. Having not been in Australia and New Zealand since 2008, PIG DESTROYER\u2019s long overwaited return has just one goal. To unnerve the unprepared with a deranged, grisly intensity which very few, if any, can match.\n\nRecently reforming to the original line-up, Singapore\u2019s WORMROT resume their genius in unleashing exquisite noise together, with the announcement of a new album 'TNT'.

This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\nhttps://www.undertheradar.co.nz/tour/30764/Nui-Hui-7.utr\n\n",

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nMercy Lie:\n\nDriving all night under the stars, along the highways of human experience, the original songs of Mercy Lie will haunt, surprise, remind and affirm.\n\nMercy Lie is the musical guise of Laura Chester-Murphy. An instinctive sound maker from an early age, Laura just wants to keep the music rolling. There\u2019s a lot of sound from that little acoustic guitar and a voice to match. In the songs, you will find fierce independence, crushing vulnerability and a reflective wit that speaks to a life of figuring stuff out along the way.\n\nWith influences ranging across and not limited to folk, funk, country, goth, indie and 90\u2019s rave, Laura puts the focus on crafting percussive earworms that won\u2019t leave your head easily. The music of Mercy Lie is a unique soundscape, sculpted with ambience and depth, the silence unforgettably painted by explorations into the motivations of both the self and fellow travellers.\n\nMercy Lie is about connecting over the foibles of polite society and the ways we are wired to weave around each other.\n\nHometowns, journeys, mysteries, ghosts, growing up, messing up, speaking out, moving on. If you like getting nostalgic over something and nothing all at once, buckle up.\n\n\u201cMercy Lie\u2019s novel approach to the guitar and talent for songwriting make for the perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that voice to come from that mouth.\u201d\n\u201cAn acoustic delight!\u201d\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience.

The Magnificat is a world favourite, arguably Bach's best choral piece that has transcended the ages, celebrating Luke's description of Mary's pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, the choir and orchestra perform Ritchie's Then I Understood. When a child of seven to nine, Laura Rangers sketched eight poems centred on summers at Otaki Beach, Ritchie seized the opportunity to add the musical dimension and the result are dual choirs - the Renaissance Singers split - accompanied by the Sinfonia to set off Rangers' delightful insights, so elegantly displayed. The magic that can be childhood.\n\nThe concert has a celebratory theme, it being the 50th anniversary of the choir. Thus the inclusion of Forrest's Three Nocturnes that express the wonderment involved when examining the heavens and the universe full of stars. Throughout this piece the percussionists alone from the Sinfonia provide whimsical accompaniment with a celeste providing the heavenly tones - a hit when played on the last occasion the choir sang the piece.\n\nOpening the concert will be Carl Orff's O Fortuna from his popular Carmina Burana. While O Fortuna laments the role of fate it is set in the larger piece that celebrates life with gusto.\n\nWith the performers in great form (two choristers just back from singing with the world's best choir) this concert will no doubt build the sense of celebration - full of life and wonderment.\n\nGeneral Admission $25, Concession $20, Secondary School $15,\nUnder 13 Free.\n\n",

With a deep adoration for Pacific musical reference points and a desire to explore new sonic ground, LEAO synthesises non-traditional tonalities with a fa\u2018asamoa spirit, creating what some have called \u201cniu wave\u201d and \u201cPacific neo-psychedelia.\u201d A creative enigma and phenomenal live act since the release of their critically acclaimed debut GHOST ROADS in 2019, LEAO has continued to expand its vision with the 2024 single TAEAO / MEA UMA - a sparkling glimpse into a significant body of alternative Pacific music currently in development. The group is now actively working towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\n\nRomi Wrights\n\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring stories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke festival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release mid to late 2025.",

His well-honed ability to work a dance floor and his eclecticism are what has got him there. A decade or so after breaking out, he\u2019s now matured as a DJ and producer to the point where he has the confidence to lead his crowd wherever he wants and they always go with him wherever he plays. Synonymous with long sets and an innate ability to read a crowd, his immediate early impact led to high-profile gigs as soon as he arrived on the scene.\nHe is now perfectly at home at places like fabric, Circoloco, WHP, Glasgow's very own Sub Club and many more alongside a who's who of the underground scene. It's almost impossible to define his sound, switching between heavy, swing-fuelled house, fizzing techno tools and twitchy minimal wig-outs. Essentially, what you get from Jasper James are stripped-back solid grooves that make people move. Releasing on labels ranging from Optimo Trax and ESP Institute through to No Art, as well as his own Mitchell Street Records imprint, the quality remains high because releases only come when James truly connects with them. With a flurry of new music currently in the pipeline, Jasper James remains as vital a presence in the underground as ever.\nJasper is more certainly one of the finest selectors in the world.\nMake an evening of it and come for a late afternoon drink or meal - and get into the groove when the beats start.\nEarly doors, early night.\nSaturday 6 December - 7pm to 1am\nLock in the date for your dose of sonic essence.\nHouse through to techno and beyond.",

Located on the eastern side of Antananarivo, the capital, the orphanage was founded by the incredible Madame Hary in 2012. What started as a humble project from her own home has grown into a haven for 54 children, some of whom were rescued from areas where twins are sadly believed to be cursed.\n\nDespite the challenges, the orphanage continues to thrive, relying entirely on the kindness of visitors. They grow their own rice, maintain a small chicken farm, and have a vegetable garden to sustain themselves. But their greatest need is for ongoing support and resources to continue providing for these beautiful children.\n\nBy attending our concert, you\u2019ll be helping make a direct impact on the lives of these children. All profits from this concert will go toward completing the construction of a much-needed training center and extra bedrooms at Mamitiana Orphanage in Madagascar, helping provide valuable education and support to the children in their care. In May this year, we raised over $4000 at a fundraising concert and $1700 on Givealittle. Help us raise $2500 more so they can finish the building before the arrival of the rainy season.",

I\u2019ve had way too many writers think they could sum me up & relay what I\u2019m about from an hour long conversation so they could write my \u201cbio\u201d but I\u2019ve had it. Screw that. I\u2019ll tell it in my own words.\nI was born & raised in Chicago, Illinois. I grew up on the south side of the city where I attended a gospel church. I was always around a lot of heartfelt soulful music & hardworking, real, down to earth people. Although I no longer abide by any religion, I value the times I had and how they shaped me to be what I am now. I\u2019ve moved around quite a bit living in all different parts of the US.\nWhile absorbing all sorts of different cultures from here & around the world, I\u2019ve developed my own sound. I started releasing my own music in 2012 and haven\u2019t stopped since. I play a wide range of music from folk to blues, r&b, Gospel to rock, metal & alotta things in between. The main constant amongst all the genres would be that it\u2019s all done with emotion, feeling, heart & a lotta soul. I mean what I say & deeply feel what I play.\nI play covers of songs I dig sometimes and although some people may only know me because of those, I\u2019m hardly just a cover artist.\nIf you come see me play live and expect just one style or aspect of what I do, you may be disappointed to learn that our shows are a roller coaster of emotions, musical styles, intensity & energy. I get bored easily & love to mix things up. Be ready & bring your ear plugs just in case..\nI\u2019ve always been the underdog so to speak since I\u2019ve never had the backing of a large record label, big marketing firm or massive PR company & I truly like it that way. I feel as though I\u2019ve earned what I have through hard work, determination, a good bit of luck & the great relationships with people I\u2019ve made along the way. I\u2019ve learned a lot of lessons the hard way being in this \u201cmusic business industry\u201d and that\u2019s alright by me.\nI\u2019ve seen that with your support (the listeners out there) I can make my wildest dreams come true.\nIf you want to listen to an artist that\u2019s authentic, genuine & original then you\u2019ve come to the right place. I hope you enjoy the music & will join me on this journey that I\u2019m so extremely grateful to be on.\nThank you all so very much.\nLove,\nShawn James\" ",

At the same time you ask? Come find out.\n\nEdera is an alt-rock\u2013indie\u2013sad girl artist from Te Whanganui-a-Tara, delivering romantic yet callous songwriting that makes you want to dance, cry, and maybe do both at once. Ederacore blends lush indie textures with gritty rock energy, brought to life by melancholy rock legends Aidan Thomas-Inwood (guitar), Lily Hodgson-Bell (bass), and Taiki Yoshino (drums) - Together, they create an immersive live experience\u2014intimate, cathartic, and impossible to forget.\n\nLadyReign is a six-piece alternative-metal band blending soul-stirring harmonies with the raw\nintensity of heavy metal breakdowns. Fronted by two powerful female vocalists, the band\ncreates a captivating contrast that draws inspiration from both soulful icons like Lianne La\nHavas and the crushing heaviness of bands like Spiritbox. LadyReign fuses vulnerability with\naggression in a sound that is both haunting and refreshing.\nWith their fearless blend of metal and soul, LadyReign is a band that leaves an unforgettable\nmark on the Wellington and wider Aotearoa music scene.\n\nIn faith to the literal etymology of the term 'metalcore', Cryfor combines Bridge 9, Deathwish era hardcore with golden era melodic death metal. As hard as they are brutal, Cryfor aims to bring real deal spin kickers and battle jacket bros together in the same pit.\nOriginally starting as the bedroom recording project of vocalist and lyricist Ella O'Neill, Cryfor is a band dedicated to reviving and breathing new life into 2000s style metalcore.\nAfter recruiting drummer Fionn Lawley, and guitarist/backing vocalist Daniel Jenner (ex King Hit HC & Temperatures Rising) in late 2024 and bassist Daniel Walters in early 2025, Cryfor has been a rolling tank of non-stop hatemosh force.\nAfter months in the lab at MOSH SCIENCE HQ, Cryfor release 'The Winter Demo', and has since punished Valhalla, San Fran, Thistle Hall and Underworld Tavern with fuck you mosh parts of toughness, vocals or sheer brutality and ancient melodies foretold by prophets of evil... and that's only the start.\n\n",

Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

Next up is local producer, musician and songwriter Phil Riley, followed by a good 50 mins of toe-tapping grooving with The Grey Dog Band.\n\nMore about the artists:\n\nRachel Hird is a Wellington based singer-songwriter. She grew up playing the piano and studying classical music. Nowadays she writes and performs her own songs, best described as \u2018songs from the heart'. She is constantly inspired by people she meets in the world of music such as musician, vocalist, songwriter and mentor Brenda Shearer, and sing-songwriter Charlotte Yates whose songwriting school is a place where many songs have been crafted. Rachel's songs are inspired by people, places and events of the past and present. She is planning an EP release early 2026.\n\nPhil Riley is a full-time writer /producer with a recording studio in Korokoro. He's a wordsmith and melodic songwriter with influences from the Beatles and Paul Simon to Coldplay. Phil started on the English Club circuit as a guitarist, then drummer and keyboard player/singer in NZ bands.\nRiley got to know Grammy winner Jon Mark of White Cloud Records (Naxos), and this led to a series of 6 Celtic and World music albums for the label, including The Blessing Tree, which reached #11 on the US radio play charts and was nominated for 5 NZ Tui music awards.\n\nRiley has tracks on European and US albums alongside artists such as Enya, Sarah McLachlan, Sinead O\u2019Connor, Secret Garden and Clannad. The compilation \u2018Celtic Journey\u2019 reached #1 on the American Billboard charts.\n\nOver the past few years, the art and craft of songwriting has become a priority, driving his recording and performing focus and moving his musical centre of gravity. His first \u2019new\u2019 indie album \u2018Five Dollar Rockets\u2019 featured a stellar cast of instrumentalists and singers.\nIn this unplugged \u2018sneak preview\u2019 of songs from the first and upcoming second album he\u2019ll be joined by long-time talented music buddies Charlie Harter and Marty Parlane on guitars and the wonderful Brenda Shearer on vocals.\n\nThe Grey Dog are a deluded bunch of cork-sniffers who think they will improve with age. They are John Broadbent \u2013 vocals, guitar and harp, Martyn Parlane \u2013 vocals and guitar, Graeme \u201cGrey Dog\u201d Sullivan \u2013 bass and vocals and Greg Bates - drums. They often play around Courtenay Place, where they use their music to lure passing sailors to their doom. Their musical style is wide-ranging, but basically Boomer. They hope their music will provide some fuel for your hearts, heads, and toes.\n\nThe Realm is a family friendly venue with a great vibe, good food, including children's menu and a good range of refreshing beverages available at the bar.

Visceral and cathartic shows where crushing riffs & sprawling drones collide with extended bursts of wild improvisation. In 2024, the band released their critically acclaimed album The Healer, a sweeping, transformative work spanning four monumental tracks. The record dives deep into themes of regeneration, suffering, and spiritual reconstruction \u2014 a testament to the band\u2019s ability to meld raw power with emotional depth.\n\nThe experimental metal trio\u2019s four-song, 76-minute album is the peak of their career. It\u2019s dense and invigorating, highlighting the band\u2019s dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. - Pitchfork\nSoon after the release, SUMAC teamed up with poet and sound artist Moor Mother to release The Film, a boundary-pushing collaborative album. Released via Thrill Jockey in April 2025, the record unfolds as a cinematic journey across eight \u201cscenes,\u201d merging SUMAC\u2019s heavy, jazz-inflected textures with Moor Mother\u2019s incisive spoken-word commentary.\n\nSUMAC\u2019s work has always been about the transition between different states of being. Our sense of normal, and indeed our sense of life, is now being shaken. We don\u2019t know what is coming next. We are looking for pointers towards the future, as well as things to hold onto in the moment.\n  \nNew Zealanders, don\u2019t miss this rare and powerful journey into uncharted sonic terrain.",

With releases from some of the biggest names in the game, AlpaKa MuziK has been paving the way for this fast emerging genre with relentless quality music and has become one of the most prominent labels in the psychedelic techno sub-genre.\nWith over 125 releases and over 650 tracks under their belt, AlpaKa has quickly become a powerhouse label in the underground techno community.\n\nSince early 2022, in a little over 2 years, KOZY has gone on 9 international tours, including 5 euro tours, Australia, South Africa Mauritius, India, Mexico and has played over 150 gigs in 24 months in over 30 countries and counting.\n\nSome prominent festivals he has performed at include, Esoteric in Australia, Hadra in France, Texas Eclipse, Boom Festival and many others, bringing to many of them the AlpaKa MuziK takeovers that showcase the cutting edge psychedelic techno sound through countless live sets around the world.\nHe recently finished his 4-month long 2025 summer euro tour where he performed at Boom Festival in Portugal and many more AlpaKa Showcases all around Europe and beyond. His 2025-2026 world tour is in motion, with Japan and a large Southern Hemisphere schedule in the works.

His 2024 single Birds of Paradise (Soliq Records) soared to #33, while his Inner Groove remix landed at #23 in Progressive House (Techgnosis Records).

It draws inspiration from urban isolation and the weight of expectations. Tracks from the EP have landed on major Spotify and Apple playlists. Reflecting the office environment, familiar to many, this performance will bring to life the themes from the EP in a host of ways.\n\nWith over 2.2 million streams across platforms and 1.8 million on Spotify alone, his impact is growing. Releases have landed on global and regional editorial playlists. His EPs\u2014Fantasy, Monarch, SugarCoated and now F.O.M.O \u2014have consistently showcased his range and evolution as an artist.\n\nSig Wilder & Friends blend kiwi authenticity with American grit, bringing you a well-worn handwritten journal of lived experiences rendered through metaphor, poetic prose, and the stylistic conventions of folk, alt-country and late-night heartbreak radio.\n\nJosh Glennie is a soulful singer/songwriter based in Wellington, New Zealand. He's made a name for himself playing in bands around Wellington and is now striking out with his own solo material. Together with Tarn, they have produced a new EP of songs that cut to the bone, focused around acoustic guitar and Josh's striking vocals. His New EP is expected late 2025/early 2026.\n\n",

    "description": "Techno Taster, Techno Taster\nThis year for the first of our annual pre-parties we\u2019ve gone around the country to gather a lineup of creators working at the intersections of techno, delving into influences from bass, breaks, psychedelia, club music and beyond, all underpinned by elements of dance music's most enduring genre.\n\nWe believe each one of these acts is currently pushing the needle forward for underground club culture in Aotearoa, and are thrilled to host them all together at Valhalla to push their vision across the almighty Third Eye Hi-Fi soundsystem.\n\n\nELI H\u00d8FF \u2014 Abyssal Soundworks / PHTM\n\nProducer and DJ, Eli is undoubtedly at the forefront of Aotearoa\u2019s underground dance scene.\nThose who have kept their ears tuned to the innovative underground have no doubt stumbled upon the tribalistic, psychedelic, and focused sounds emanating from the mind of Auckland-based producer Eli H\u00f8ff. With a string of releases on Berlin-based PHTM, T\u0101maki Makaurau-based Gypnotica, and an impressive catalog of self-releases, he consistently showcases his singular and original interpretation of dance music.\n\nInstagram.com/e.li\nelihoff.bandcamp.com\nabyssalsoundworks.bandcamp.com\n\n\nHUNTER \u2014 Hang the Saints / Haven\n\nRaised in Kaik\u014dura, Aotearoa, Hunter's dark and atmospheric sound often contrasts the beautiful environment she grew up in. Her direct approach to techno draws influence from heavy percussion, bold rhythm and industrial soundscapes. After spending two years finding inspiration in clubs overseas, she has returned to \u014ctautahi with a refined style that\u2019s ready to make people dance. As the co-founder of \u201cHang The Saints\u201d and resident of \u201cHaven\u201d, Hunter is all about creating safe, inclusive spaces for people to connect through the music she loves.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sspoonsnake/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hunter-mccrory-334790608\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/bC3qeA6pUxBoMo7P9\n\n\nLUDUS & RIZZO \u2014 Tonic Collective\n\nTonic Collective is the recent endeavour of Ludus and Rizzo, inspired by the people, places and spaces of their experience touring China with BIRDPARTY and Vera Ellen. Both acts are individually known for their versatile and innovative sound, bringing a wide range of influences and inspirations to the dancefloor. In the short time since establishing the collective, they\u2019ve already hosted Kaishandao and Bone Chapel, established a space, and debuted a monthly radio show on Mouthfull that explores sound from across the genre spectrum, both in the club and out.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ludus.etc/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alicerizzoofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tonic.collective/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/l-s-rizzo/416life-support-cl1n1c-chengdu\nhttps://soundcloud.com/racquetclub-info/mix-series-016-ludus\n\n\nSHLI \u2014 Echo Train Records / Warehouse Rave / Holding Hands\n\nShli is the alias of \u014ctautahi-via-P\u014dneke DJ and Producer Tim Ward. Steadily releasing works over recent years through local labels like Echo Train and the Big Fresh Collective, he is carving out a sound of his own.\n\nStitching together infectious rhythms layered over low-end pressure, Shli\u2019s sets draw influence from across the hardcore continuum and beyond. Creating dancefloor moments from trippy rhythmic states to unleashing sheer bass weight.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/____shli/\nhttps://echotrainer.bandcamp.com/album/ech009-bracing-set-pace-u-dont\nhttps://soundcloud.com/1shli\n\n",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\n\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.\n\n",

    "description": "The Jesus Lizard - San Fran, Wellington, The Jesus Lizard Return to New Zealand this October:\nThe quintessential punk band of the 90\u2019s - the Jesus Lizard, returns to New Zealand shores for the first time in 27 years this October! Playing two exclusive shows only at Auckland\u2019s Tuning Fork and San Fran in Wellington on the 11th and 12th respectively.\nAfter initially calling it a day in 1999, the Jesus Lizard officially return full time to save us from the current state of musical mediocrity with their latest album, Rack. A blistering resurgence of the so-called \u2018noise rock\u2019 they helped define alongside contemporaries Big Black, Flipper, The Birthday Party, with their previous and most noted albums Head, Goat and Liar. For those of us who live in fear of the reunion album and subsequent tour, the Jesus Lizard thankfully display not only the same chaotic and dark nihilism of their earlier careers but also the maturity and seasoning of a band riding a wave of renewed and reinvigorated form.\nOnce slated by famed engineer Steve Albini as \u201cthe greatest band I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019 the Jesus Lizard not only lived up to this lofty praise in their prime but continue to do so in their advancing years. David Yow still leads the charge as the maniacally possessed frontman entering crowds with reckless abandon and a stamina that much younger vocalists would kill for. The original rhythm section of David Wm Sims and Mac McNeilly further continue to prove why they were and are the best bass & drum combo since Jones and Bonham, anchoring the ship as Captain Yow and first mate Denison navigate the wild seas of their songs. And while he may not always feature (as he rightly should) on many modern music journalists \u2018best guitarists lists\u2019, Duane Denison could perhaps be the most innovative and idiosyncratic punk rock guitarist EVER. However, each member is a sum of their parts but combined they are as Albini also once said \u201cthe purest melding of the sublime and profane.\u201d\nWhether you are a longtime disciple of the Jesus Lizard, seeing them when last here in \u201898, or perhaps your fandom is more recent and have only seen videos of their legendary live performances, you will know that these shows are not to be missed.\nTickets available Thursday 8TH May at 12pm from:\nSaturday 11th October 2025 - The Tuning Fork, Auckland (All ages):\nhttps://moshtix.co.nz/.../the-jesus-lizard-nz-tour.../180227\nSunday 12th October 2025 - San Fran, Wellington (R18 unless accompanied by your legal guardian)",

Vivid, offbeat, and full of heart, the record captures Cunliffe at his most direct, delivering a collection of songs that glow with warmth and humanity.\nAcross its tracks, Cunliffe takes listeners on a journey from the streets of London to the bright lights of Karangahape Road, and out into the cold green waves of the Irish Sea. Each song feels alive \u2013 steeped in imagery, character, and a quiet intensity that rewards deep listening.\nRecorded live-to-tape at Roundhead Studios, 'Spit Out Your Gum' carries the unmistakable warmth of that hallowed room and the people within it. With Paddy Hill engineering, Cunliffe was joined by Dave Khan (violin, piano) and Cass Basil (bass, clarinet).\nTogether, they captured performances that unfold in real time \u2013 no edits, no digital polish, just songs recorded in single takes, preserving the intimacy, imperfection, and energy of the moment.\nAli Whitton is a New Zealand-based singer-songwriter. Born in Aotearoa and raised in rural North Yorkshire, his music blends introspective folk, alt-country, and acoustic storytelling, drawing inspiration from artists like Nick Drake, Bright Eyes, Johnny Cash, and Bob Dylan.\nWith poetic lyrics rooted in nature and emotional honesty, his songs explore themes of longing, resilience, and cosmic wonder. After an early career touring the UK and France \u2013 including sharing stages with Ed Sheeran \u2013 Ali settled in Aotearoa New Zealand, where salty sea winds and bush covered landscapes continue to shape his sound.

    "description": "Transvision Vamp, Transvision Vamp announce first New Zealand tour in 31 years!\nBritish pop rock band Transvision Vamp are bringing their hits down under for the first time in almost three decades. With shows in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch lined up for February 2026, the group will be playing their nostalgia-filled favourites.\n\u200d\nFormed in 1986, Transvision Vamp quickly rose to fame. Their songs 'Baby I Don\u2019t Care', 'Revolution Baby', 'I Want Your Love', 'The Only One' and 'If Looks Could Kill' all hit the Top 50 in the New Zealand singles chart from 1988 - 1991. Wendy James, the lead singer and focal point of the group, attracted media attention with her sexually charged and rebellious image.\n\nTransvision Vamp became known for their collision of brash punk and commercial pop, and joining James on this tour are some musical luminaries: Alex Ward (The Thurston Moore Group) on guitar, Dave Parsons (Transvision Vamp) on bass, and James Sclavunos (Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds) on drums.\n\nWendy James went on to pursue a successful solo career spanning an additional seven studio albums, including a notable collaboration with Elvis Costello. She served as a feminist symbol in the 80\u2019s for unapologetic self-expression and fearless leadership.\n\nJames says, \"I am so very excited to be coming back to New Zealand to play the songs which started my whole musical journey! I remember vividly so many incredible moments gigging in New Zealand, moments of enormous success, enormous love and enormous fun. I\u2019m bringing with me a set full of music that will thrill and musicians who will amaze!\"",

The pair met at the Elam School of Fine Arts. Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995.

Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\n\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo.

    "description": "the Jesus Lizard, After initially calling it a day in 1999, the Jesus Lizard officially return full time to save us from the current state of musical mediocrity with their latest album, Rack. A blistering resurgence of the so-called \u2018noise rock\u2019 they helped define alongside contemporaries Big Black, Flipper, The Birthday Party, with their previous and most noted albums Head, Goat and Liar. For those of us who live in fear of the reunion album and subsequent tour, the Jesus Lizard thankfully display not only the same chaotic and dark nihilism of their earlier careers but also the maturity and seasoning of a band riding a wave of renewed and reinvigorated form.\n\nOnce slated by famed engineer Steve Albini as \u201cthe greatest band I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019 the Jesus Lizard not only lived up to this lofty praise in their prime but continue to do so in their advancing years. David Yow still leads the charge as the maniacally possessed frontman entering crowds with reckless abandon and a stamina that much younger vocalists would kill for. The original rhythm section of David Wm Sims and Mac McNeilly further continue to prove why they were and are the best bass & drum combo since Jones and Bonham, anchoring the ship as Captain Yow and first mate Denison navigate the wild seas of their songs. And while he may not always feature (as he rightly should) on many modern music journalists \u2018best guitarists lists\u2019, Duane Denison could perhaps be the most innovative and idiosyncratic punk rock guitarist EVER. However, each member is a sum of their parts but combined they are as Albini also once said \u201cthe purest melding of the sublime and profane.\u201d\n\nWhether you are a longtime disciple of the Jesus Lizard, seeing them when last here in \u201898, or perhaps your fandom is more recent and have only seen videos of their legendary live performances, you will know that these shows are not to be missed.\n\nSaturday 11th October 2025 - The Tuning Fork, Auckland (All ages)\n\nSunday 12th October 2025 - San Fran, Wellington (R18 unless accompanied by your legal guardian)",

    "description": "Bach Choir, Nota Bene, Chiesa Ensemble - Bach's Christmas Oratorio, The Bach Choir of Wellington, in collaboration with Nota Bene and the Chiesa Ensemble, presents Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio (Parts I, II, III & VI).\n\nBach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio, BWV 248, is a spiritually rich masterpiece composed during 1723 and 1724 and first performed in its entirety during the Christmas season of 1734\u20131735 while Bach was serving in Leipzig. Drawing on earlier secular cantatas and a now-lost church cantata (BWV 248a), this oratorio weaves together a vibrant tapestry of sacred music celebrating the birth of Christ.\n\nThis performance features four of the six cantatas:\n\nPart I opens with a dazzling transformation of secular music into sacred celebration. Drums, strings, winds, and triumphant trumpets set the stage for the Evangelist\u2019s narration and a sequence of expressive recitatives and arias, including the beloved \u201cBereite dich, Zion\u201d and the majestic \u201cGro\u00dfer Herr, o starker K\u00f6nig.\u201d Chorales, including the Passion Chorale, frame the cantata with solemn beauty.\n\nPart II begins with a pastoral, tender tone, portraying the shepherds\u2019 encounter with the angel. The sinfonia evokes a rustic charm with oboes and flutes, leading into serene chorales and the exquisite slumber aria, where the flute hovers like a halo above the alto voice. The cantata concludes with a joyful \u201cGlory to God\u201d and a reprise of \u201cVom Himmel hoch.\u201d\n\nPart III returns to grandeur with trumpets and drums, as the shepherds journey to Bethlehem. The Evangelist\u2019s narration is interwoven with contemplative chorales, a duet for soprano and bass, and an aria reflecting Mary\u2019s inner thoughts. The cantata closes with a reprise of its opening chorus, reinforcing its celebratory tone.\n\nPart VI, written for Epiphany, shifts to a darker mood as the story turns to Herod\u2019s treachery. The music is dramatic and unpredictable, mirroring the tension of the narrative. The arias and recitatives explore divine power and moral conflict, culminating in a triumphant final chorus embedded with the Passion Chorale\u2014symbolically linking Christ\u2019s birth to his eventual sacrifice.\n\nThis is the first time in over a decade the Christmas Oratorio is being performed in Wellington, making this a special opportunity to experience one of Bach\u2019s most joyful and profound creations. We hope you will join us for an evening of radiant music and festive spirit.",

Because I work and hold space within a high vibrational field, everyone present is able to access, attune to, and receive these elevated frequencies too - opening a gateway to higher states of awareness and multidimensional reconnection.\nThis is a multi-layered energetic journey that will support your soul\u2019s evolution and empower you with tools to continue accessing these frequencies whenever you need them.\n\nIn Ancient Atlantean Times...\nHealing was simple.\nPeople would sit before sacred, light-infused paintings, allowing frequency, sound, and intention to restore balance and harmony.\nI\u2019m bringing this ancient practice back.\n\nJoin me for a group Healing Session in Wellington \u2022 a beautiful multidimensional experience for deep new-code absorption, renewal, and alignment. You\u2019ll sit in sacred space before my Pleiadian Portal Painting, surrounded by gentle frequency music, sipping ceremonial Kakao, and immersed in high-vibrational energy.\nEach person will receive a clearing and then be guided through a powerful meditation and activation, with time to journal and share afterwards.\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s Included in This Sacred Attunement Journey\n\u2022 Individual Galactic Clearing\nWe begin by preparing your field for higher frequencies. Each participant will receive a personal energy clearing to release stagnant or lower vibrations, supported by channeled light language to open you to deeper transformation.\n\n\u2022 Heart-Opening Kacao Ceremony\nOnce the clearing is complete, we\u2019ll share a gentle ceremonial Kacao experience to expand the heart, deepen receptivity, and create a sacred container for Pleiadian frequencies to flow through.\n\n\u201cRaise Your Vibration\u201d Pleiadian Wisdom Talk\nI\u2019ll share insights into who the Pleiadians are, their role in humanity\u2019s awakening, and how their joyous, supportive energy can help you in everyday life. You\u2019ll also receive simple, powerful tools to help you reconnect with this frequency long after our circle.\n\n\u2022 Guided Meditation & Activation\nWe journey through a deeply guided meditation supported by my Pleiadian Encoded Artwork and light language transmissions. This works on a soul level to activate deeper layers of your light body, anchor wisdom, and align you with higher frequencies. The energetic transmission continues to integrate long after the session.\n\n\u2022 Personal Angelic Attunement & Integration\nTo complete our journey, each participant will receive a personal ANGELIC attunement to anchor the frequencies received and integrate them into their unique energetic system, supporting lasting transformation and soul alignment.\n\n\u2022 Why This Circle is Unique\nThis is an intimate, boutique-style event limited to just 10 participants to ensure a deeply personal and supportive experience for everyone. Smaller groups allow me to focus the energy on each individual, maximising the depth and potency of the transformation you\u2019ll receive.\nYou will leave feeling uplifted, attuned, and supported \u2014 and with the ability to reconnect with these higher frequencies whenever you need.\nTo help extend and nurture the energy beyond the circle, supportive tools will be available and to order - including aura sprays, light-encoded scarves, and art prints, so you can continue to connect with and access the Pleiadian frequencies in your own space.\n\nEvent Details\nDate: Sunday, 7 December 2025\nLocation: Whitby, Wellington (address supplied upon booking)\nTime: 4:00 PM \u2013 6:00 PM\nExchange: NZ$65\nMaximum Group: 10 participants only \u2014 early booking is recommended.\n\n",

Connectivity through a delicious winding path of interactive games and movement expression experiences lead me to a very open and receptive creative space. Highly recommend. Amazing facilitation.\" - Lily\n\u201cThanks to this workshop, I was able to let go more than ever before, and really let in touch that was non-sexual, loving, and supportive. Thank you so much for offering another step up the mountain of growth & healing\u201d - Amanda\n*****\nImagine a day where you can drop deeply into embodied awareness, show up authentically with other heart-centred humans, and get straight to the core of what truly matters, through connective somatic practices designed to nourish your body & replenish your spirit.\nWelcome to Somatic Sanctuary, a full-day experience where you are invited to self-regulate & co-regulate through a range of complementary modalities: Yin Yoga, Authentic Relating & Contact Improvisation.\nThis February, you are invited to The Wellington Meditation Centre, a beautiful & cosy urban sanctuary complete with a tranquil garden. Come explore the many layers of yourself and others through a journey of deep yet playful communication and contact games.\nAfter taking this precious day for yourself, you are likely to step into the week ahead with a profound sense of well-being, a remarkable connection to your body and an experiential toolkit that you can use right away to make your everyday life even better.\nWHO is this day for?\nIn essence, Somatic Sanctuary is for you if you want to connect on a deeper level with your body, your desires, your boundaries, your emotional reality, your empathy skills and your ability to feel compassion for yourself. This day will enhance your interpersonal relationships and enrich your self love within.\nWhether you are a seasoned workshop/retreat goer or it\u2019s your first time ever exploring the bespoke practices, you are sure to get something valuable out of this workshop.\nYou are also most welcome if you\u2019ve been recently feeling blocked, anxious, lacking purpose or direction, and need to reground and remind yourself what's truly important and who you truly are.\nOur experience includes working with Highly Sensitive People (HSPs); neurodiverse people; people suffering from anxiety and depression; people going through major life shifts; and members of the LGBTQ+ community.\nIf you have any questions about whether the event would suit you, pop us a message and we\u2019ll get back to you within 24 hours.\nWHAT will actually happen?\nActivities will explore movement, conversation and physical contact, through the modalities of Yin Yoga, Authentic Relating & Contact Improvisation.\nYin Yoga focuses on deeply relaxing the nervous system, by bringing fresh life force (prana) to your connective tissue and vital organs. Through deep stretches, long holds, and mindful breathing, your body is given permission to fully release any tension that has accumulated over time.\nAuthentic Relating is a ground breaking social tool that invites you to courageously step into open hearted connection, through radical honesty and active listening. The practice invites you to drop deeper into presence, embodied awareness and permission to express whatever is alive within you and the \u2018we-space\u2019 between you and other(s), as well as any boundaries that emerge within the connection field.\nContact Improvisation is a dance form that emphasises both self-regulation and co-regulation, through spontaneous movement and physical connection between people, as well as the non-human physical space (such as the floor). It encourages exploration of balance, weight-sharing, and communication through touch, inducing a deeply aware state of surrendered fluidity.\nConsent will be emphasised throughout the weekend. You will continually be reminded to listen to your body and only do what is within your personal boundaries. While you will be encouraged to stretch yourself and widen your window of tolerance, you will practice identifying your stress zone and will learn tools to help you self-regulate if you push yourself too far.\nThere will also be a support team on hand if you need to co-regulate at any point.\nWHERE will it be?\nThe workshop will take place at Wellington Meditation Centre, 31 Hobson Crescent, Thorndon, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.\nThe FACILITATORS\nLaurie King\nLaurie (he/him), is a queer British-Kiwi who\u2019s current home-base is Wellington, NZ.

During her music studies at university, she was introduced to taonga p\u016boro, and this sparked a personal journey of reconnection to te ao M\u0101ori and her own whakapapa. Following university, she lived in an ashram for several years where she was introduced to the wonderful practice of bhakti yoga. She now lives with her husband in the Wellington region, where they regularly participate in kirtan (mantra music meditation) at Bhakti Lounge.\n\nPeter is P\u0101keh\u0101, with grandparents from England and Ireland, and has been on a four-year journey learning the art of taonga p\u016boro \u2014 the traditional M\u0101ori musical instruments of Aotearoa. Guided by the wisdom and generosity of expert makers and players, he has learned both to craft and to play these unique instruments. For Peter, taonga p\u016boro offer a way to connect deeply with sound, story, and the natural world, and he is excited to share their voices as part of this sound bath experience.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the menu?\nJackfruit Rendang\n\nSatay Seitan Skewer\n\nGado Gado salad with peanut sauce\n\nRice\n\nBanana cake with caramel sauce\n\nHot \"chocolate\"",

    "description": "The Greatest Story - A Group of Wise Teachers Returning, Public Talk & Workshop\n\nThroughout history, especially at times of crisis, great spiritual teachers have emerged to show humanity the next step forward.\n\nAccording to British artist, author and esotericist Benjamin Creme, a group of such spiritual teachers is now living in the modern world. Maitreya, the World Teacher, and his group The Masters of Wisdom are here - not as religious teachers - to inspire all people to create a civilisation based on sharing, justice and peace; and for humanity to act to do the work to share and save our world.\n\nHumanity at spiritual crossroads\n\nHumanity is at crossroads. One path into the future leads to increasing social and economic division, environmental destruction, war and planetary peril. The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\n\nMaitreya\u2019s priorities\n\nTo help humanity in its task of global transformation, Maitreya has formulated certain priorities. They cover the essential needs of all people, every woman, man and child: an adequate supply of food\u037e housing for all; healthcare and education as basic universal rights. Other top priorities include the restoration of the environment and the establishment of peace.\n\nThe key to achieving these goals requires a major shift of present mind-set and thinking, structures and systems \u2013 and more equitable sharing of the world\u2019s food and resources. To realise humanity is one global family and the planet is a living being. According to Maitreya: \u201cWithout sharing, there can be no justice; without justice, there can be no peace; without peace, there can be no future.\u201d\n\n~ followed by short Transmission Meditation session ~\n\nShare International New Zealand.

The moon reveals our emotional landscape, our inner rhythms, and often the fears that arise when we dare to live that full expression. Together, they form a powerful dialogue between structure and flow, logic and emotion, masculine and feminine.\n\nIn this workshop, Clare will guide you into an embodied exploration of your own sun and moon, inviting you to feel these two archetypes within your body and notice where they support, resist, or balance each other.\n\nBryony will lead you into vocal practices that bring these energies into sound and voice \u2014 giving expression to what is often left unspoken. Through voice, you\u2019ll release what holds you back and discover new harmony between your inner and outer selves.\n\nThis full moon is the perfect moment to unleash the voices of your sun and moon \u2014 and to step more fully into clarity, balance, and authentic expression.\n\nThe timing of this workshop gives you a unique opportunity to tune into these planets and benefit from their placement in the collective astrology.\n\nThe workshop will begin with the opportunity to explore powerful, enjoyable, accessible Voice Practices which open, align and strengthen your expression - and create physiological changes in your energy field.\n\nWe will then directly, bodily experience the energies of each of the Celestial Bodies through Embodied Astrology, guided by Clare.\n\nWe will integrate these energies, through further Voice Practices, including improvisation, healing chants and songs.\n\nThese two modalities will be carefully interwoven in an enjoyable, rich day's workshop that will benefit all participants.\n\nThere will be guided space in the workshop to integrate the energetic shifts and discoveries of both the Voice Practices and the Astrology.\n\nThis special workshop takes place on Saturday February 7th, 10am-4.30pm - we hope you can join us\n\nAt the Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Paraparaumu.\n\nINVESTMENT:\n\nYour investment for this day is $233. Shared lunch.\nSome concessions are available - please contact us by email .\n\nPayment by card here - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nPlease contact us with any questions at all.\n\n",

The tent is lovely during the day, but as it gets dark, it takes on a magical feeling. Fairy lights and crystals lit by gently changing coloured lights. We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle. Arniya then dances the energy in with Celestial Energy Movement, for the group. This creates a vortex of Divine power into the middle of the tent. Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\n",

After being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition at the age of eleven that left him paralyzed from the waist down, Wes experienced a miraculous recovery for which the doctors themselves had no medical explanation. This experience, along with a great deal of study and soul searching in his later teen years, solidified his interest in faith and in engaging the beliefs and worldview perspectives of others. He spent his high school years in Northern Ontario and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and three children.\n\nWesley is currently the Central Canada Director for Apologetics Canada and has been a guest on a variety of public platforms, from The Joe Rogan Experience and Piers Morgan Uncensored, to Apologia Radio and Daily Dose of Wisdom. He has participated in numerous public dialogues, debates, and interfaith events on issues of belief and religion globally.\n\nHe holds a BA in sociology from York University, a Masters of Theological Studies from Tyndale University, and is currently doing a PhD in New Testament at the University of Toronto\u2019s Wycliffe College.\n\n",

Her journey is rooted in self-growth and connection, with a strong focus on nourishing the body as an essential part of this.\n\nMeet Alex, your sound healer\nAlex is a sound healing practitioner devoted to nurturing healing in both mind and body. She believes that sound vibration holds the power to expand consciousness and restore harmony and balance in our lives. Her journey into sound healing began with the realization of how deeply sound vibration was affecting her psyche\u2014making her more mindful of the music she listens to and the intention it carries. Along the way, she has drawn inspiration from artists such as Deva Premal, The Flying Mystics, Stevin McNamara, and the Bhakti Lounge Kirtan. Their music has profoundly influenced her own sound healing practice, inspiring her to explore sound as a tool for transformation, connection, and inner peace.",

Now that we finally know what he\u2019s fighting, I want to turn my energy into something that can help him\u2014and others\u2014on their journeys.\nAccording to CLL Advocates NZ, only 10-15 people out of 250 on average per year benefit from the budget allocation. And many are not even able to receive the same treatment options here in NZ.\nSquash has always been a sport of endurance, resilience, and determination. Playing for 24 hours is my way of honoring his fight, raising awareness, and bringing people together to support the cause.\nYou can help by:\nDonating: Any amount you would like to.\nPredicting: Predicting how many points and games will be played in 24 hours.\nJoining me on court: Book a slot to play a game, cheer from the sidelines, or come be part of the atmosphere.\nBuy raffle tickets, or sponsor a prize towards the raffle.\nWe would like to give a shout out to our current sponsors;\nHair Phoria,\nAimee Photography,\nX-Potential,\nMitchells,\nMeaters,\nCBD Eatery,\nForrest Wines and\nFat Tony's\nNo matter how small, your contribution will make a difference. Together we can transform his story of late diagnosis into one of community, awareness, and action.\nI\u2019ll be pushing myself through the night, but I won\u2019t be alone\u2014your support will keep me going with every serve, rally, and game. Let\u2019s make this 24 hours count.",

Whilst there is some faster efforts needed to come out on top of any of these \u201cdisciplines\u201d, the aim of the game is just to get out there and enjoy yourself at whatever pace suits you.\n\nThe added extra this time is not only an extra hour, explained below, but the plan is to tie this into the elevation for a group effort for a BTR Everest Challenge, more details around this when I can get a team entry together, but really keen to try and pudh the limits of what has been done before.\n\nDetails:\nDate: 26th October - Backup date is the week after\nTime: 6am-1pm - (1 hr per week it too Hialry to conquer everest!)\nLocation: The Wither Hills, Basecamp: Sutherland Stream picnic area - this will be where we have the whiteboard & a bit of an \"Aid station/Bag drop\" situation going on.\n\nDisciplines:\n- \"Vernon Vert Masters\" Highest total elevation (solo/team) - pretty self explanatory, but between the hours of 6 am- 1pm any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day (solo or in a team) counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n\n- \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop (solo/team) - Crush the covenant Loop is a 3.75km, 300m vert loop running from Sutherland Stream Picnic Area to the Mt Vernon Summit & then back down again, the loops can be run in whichever direction you would like, just be aware that this is a 2-way track and there will be a bit more traffic than you would usually see up on it. The aim of the game here is to get as many laps in as possible between 6 am-1pm; this will also count toward your elevation total for the \"Vernon Vert Masters\"\n\nThe Basics:\n- This is an open event to anyone who wants to participate\n- The event is open from 6am-1pm - any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n- We will have a basecamp/aid station at the Sutherland stream picnic spot. This will be the hub for the meet-up and the start/finish line for the laps of \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d.\n- No minimum time, you can start whenever you like in the 6 am-1pm timeframe and go for as long as you would like.\n-You can do as many laps/summits/cumulative elevation as you like/can within the timeframe.\n- Teams - Teams can be between 2-5 people for the overall elevation challenge, and your total elevation will be your total accumulated. You will need to pre-register your team with Mikey before the day so that we can have you on the scoreboard.\n- You will need to confirm your solo/teams total elevation with Basecamp by 1.30pm on the day, in person. If you are unable to do this for whatever reason, you will need to confirm and prove details via message or screenshots so we can add them to the total tally.\n\n\nWho's up for some hills?\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nWe at Blenheim Trail Runners don\u2019t see ourselves as event organisers and as such, do not have any consent or insurance; we deem this as a \u201cClub Meet-up\u201d.\nWith that, the expectation is that you are 100% responsible for yourself and take part at your own risk.\nBe aware, as this isn't a formal event, there won't be any official timekeeping, marshals or trail markers. There will be DIY DIY-type whiteboard to note down your shared laps & elevation, and we will provide details via trail maps for the \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop.\nWe are unable to provide any/can not be held responsible for: Urgent medical attention (we will however, assist wherever possible, there will be a first aid kit at base camp), nutrition, hydration ( there is public access throughout the hills and in two points on the \u201ccrush the Covenant\u201d loop), the condition of the trail on the day or the weather.\n\n",

K\u0101piti Run for Youth is a lively, family-friendly event focused on fostering community spirit and supporting organisations that encourage and uplift local young people. RAIN or SHINE, get ready to have fun!\n\nWe know K\u0101piti Run for Youth helps to support amazing community work done by local fundraising partners. We have 13 incredible fundraising partners you can choose to support and raise funds for. We are very proud of them all and the work they do to uplift the youth of K\u0101piti. Each partner brings something unique to the table, from providing essential resources and mentorship to creating spaces where young people can thrive. By supporting rangatahi through education, creativity, employment, and well-being initiatives, they ensure our youth are not just supported but empowered to reach their full potential. Our partners are creating a brighter tomorrow for the young people of K\u0101piti!\n\nIn the beginning K\u0101piti Run for Youth was created by Web Genius as their way as a local business to \u2018give back\u2019 to the community so, more than a decade on we can proudly say the event is sustainable and is popular with all sorts, young and old, the fit and not so fit. K\u0101piti Run for Youth has raised $280,003 for rangatahi since inception in 2011. In 2025 the event raised $25,531 which was remarkable.\n\nK\u0101piti Run for Youth will be open for sign up early in January 2026 >> https://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/signup\n\nAt that time, we will be seeking individuals and teams to get together to walk or run from Paraparaumu Beach (Maclean Park) to Raumati Beach and back. For those choosing the 12km walk or run, they will do two circuits of the course.\n\nChoose your adventure \u2013 a 6km or 12km run or walk along the beautiful K\u0101piti coastline. Whether it's a leisurely stroll or a mad dash to be the first across the finish, you choose the event that suits you best, and which of our amazing fundraising partners you're going to raise funds for. On race day grab your dog and your mates and head down to the beach for fun, family and fitness. Registration takes place from 8.30am to 9.45am with a briefing at 9.45am and all walkers and runners starting together at 10am.\n\nOnce your profile is set-up online, let your family, friends and work mates know so they can sponsor your efforts. We encourage every participant to raise $20 through sponsorship instead of paying an entry fee. All entrants receive regular campaigns to motivate their sponsorship efforts along the way.\n\nK\u0101piti Run for Youth prides itself on being a sustainable, family-friendly event that is all about supporting each other and having fun. Join your community for a feel-good morning on the beach. Your fundraising makes a difference in the lives of our young people! BYO sunhat, sunscreen, and water on the day, and there are sponsored spot prizes, treats for the kids, certificates for participating and free Paek\u0101k\u0101riki Mini Pops for everyone at the end.\n\nCheckout our FAQs over on our website >> https://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/faqs\n\nCloser to the event, go to our website to sign up or sponsor someone that you know who is participating >>\nhttps://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/search\n\nAll registrations and sponsorship are handled securely and confidentially on the K\u0101piti Run for Youth website that is powered by Raisley and supported by Stripe online payments.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBUSINESS SPONSORSHIP\nPlatinum $1,000+, Gold $500, Silver $250, Bronze $125 is available for businesses who want to support the underlying work of this event and rangatahi youth of K\u0101piti.

    "description": "Porirua Parkrun, What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

Knowing Peter (club manager), he will have a brandy and coke special again like last time. I will ask him for his latest drinks price list and post it here for you to see. Their prices are very reasonable.\nLooking forward to seeing you all there in your best Bokke outfits as the warm up for the following weekend's game in Wellington!\nAs you may be aware, the Bokke will be playing two games in New Zealand in September. The first game will be in Auckland on 6 September and the second on 13 September right here in Wellington.\nI have booked the Tawa Squash Club to watch the game on the 6th of September.

Each of the six laps is slightly over 7km, with around 400m in elevation (2500m in total). Try not to trip on a loose rock while taking in the aromatic smells emanating from the tip.

Same course as above but three laps instead of six,\nRecommended donation: $25\n\nTip Track Marathon (TTM) is a low-key, no frills trail running race that takes place at the Tip Track in Wellington each year - all in the name of charity.

Those that question the monotony of their daytime jobs and wonder, \"isn't there meant to be more to life than this?\" Enter TTM...

Return could therefore either be 1:30 or 2:30 with the latest return to Titahi Bay being 3pm.\n\nWe've made this event later than the normal SKISL so that it's easier for folks to drive down from Palmerston North, and also because it is a lunch event.\n\nThe lawn on Mana is really nice, sheltered and pleasant and there are also good walks. Mana is of course a sanctuary so you must check your boats for any wildlife especially ants that may have gotten in past the hatches. Also we cannot have any fires\n\nPlan B: If weather nukes Mana, we'll try for Green Point or Onehunga Bay in Whitireia Park by driving there.\n\nPlan C: We will postpone to 21 December\n\n",
