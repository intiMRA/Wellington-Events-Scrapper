This exhibition will explore the tones, textures, composition and forms of the Chapel in black and white with many shades of grey.\n\"Generally, the older the equipment, the greater the personal input of the photographer is required and therefore the greater the commitment and individuality. Often, you can look at a 19th-century photograph and tell who the photographer is. You certainly can't do that today. It isn't only the camera and lens, but also the type of film (or in those days, glass plate), the developer used and how the print is made onto particular types of paper. Each gives a distinct interpretation\".\nJohn Grace - email - 18/06/25\nThe Trust looks forward to welcoming architects, designers, graduates, students and interested members of the public to attend this event and support the Trust in its work.\nThe Futuna Trust is a charitable organisation and all koha received from the exhibition events will go towards the ongoing care, maintenance and operation of Futuna Chapel and also to support various initiatives undertaken by the Trust.  Please register\nBOOKINGS ARE PREFERRED TO ATTEND THIS EVENT",
