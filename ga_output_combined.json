In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship.

Rooted in ancestral echoes, each story is poetic, powerful, and fleeting; never to be told the same way twice.\n\nInspired by the workshop The Stories That Made Us, the show blends magical realism, oral tradition, and ensemble connection.\n\nWith previous presentations in Auckland and Brisbane (as part of the 2025 Brisbane Improv Festival), Bonfire now arrives at the New Zealand Improv Festival, inviting audiences into a space of warmth, wonder, and shared humanity.\n\nThis show may include content related to family, identity, cultural heritage, and emotional themes. While performers are encouraged to approach these with care and sensitivity, the improvised nature of the show means themes may vary each night. The show may contain voluntary audience interaction, such as giving a suggestion for a scene.",

On both floors you\u2019ll find a series of balistraria, tightly angled gun slots through which members of the militia would defend their posts.\n\nKeep an eye out, too, for an exposed panel where you can see the fine gravel that was packed between the exterior weatherboards and inch-thick interior boards to absorb the impact of answering gunfire. Don\u2019t be fooled by the windows \u2013 they were added later. Originally, the loop holes you\u2019ll spy on the walls were the only way to see out.\n\nInside the Blockhouse, there\u2019s an exhibition from Whirinaki Whare Taonga, telling the early story of Upper Hutt and its Blockhouse.\n\nWe will have some knowledgeable people available to share stories, answer questions and some light refreshments. Drop in between 11-1pm and stay as long as you like!\n\n\nBooking is REQUIRED.\nCost: $10 - $15\nBooking information here: https://wellingtonheritagefestival.co.nz/event/visit-the-upper-hutt-blockhouse/\n\n\nHealth & Safety:\nPlease note as an historic building the Upper Hutt Blockhouse is not suitable for those with accessibility needs.\n\n",

    "description": "Book Launch - South by South by Charles Ferrall, Join us to celebrate the publication of Charles Ferrall's South by South: New Zealand and the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The book will be launched by Harry Ricketts.\n\n- Thursday 18 September, 6pm\n- Unity Books Wellington\n- Free event \u2013 all welcome!\n\nJoseph Kinsey is not a name many of us know \u2013 or not as well as we know the name Robert Falcon Scott. But from his base in Christchurch, Kinsey \u2013 book and art collector, philanthropist, science enthusiast, businessman \u2013 forged deep connections with the Antarctic expeditions and the explorers themselves through his tireless work as the agent for various expeditions. Two other New Zealanders also formed close friendships: Charles Bowen, a former politician, and Wellington lawyer Leonard Tripp, to whom Shackleton declared: \u2018I love you as David and Jonathan loved.\u2019\n\nSouth by South tells the story of New Zealand\u2019s role in \u2018the Heroic Age\u2019, that wave of exploration beginning at the end of the nineteenth century in which men set out to traverse the continent of Antarctica and, if they survived, to bring home their findings. The members of this New Zealander triumvirate were all believers in the British Empire, but the southern voyages were to an uninhabited land.\n\nSouth by South brings to light many letters, newspaper articles, and pieces of official correspondence, much of which has not been published before, during the five expeditions of 1901\u20131916: the Discovery, Nimrod, Terra Nova, Aurora, and Endurance. In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship. What they and the explorers wrote was influenced by nineteenth-century adventure stories which conveyed the Imperialist ideals of the time. If the impending conflict of 1914\u201318 was a very \u2018literary war\u2019, this was a very literary exploration.\n\nCharles Ferrall is an associate professor at Te Herenga Waka\u2013Victoria University of Wellington. Among his books are Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics (2001); The Trials of Eric Mareo (2002), co-written with Rebecca Ellis; East by South: China in the Australasian Imagination (2006), co-edited with Paul Millar and Keren Smith; Juvenile Literature and British Society 1850\u20131950 (2009), co-written with Anna Jackson; Henry Lawson in New Zealand (2012); How We Remember: New Zealanders and the First World War (2014), co-edited with Harry Ricketts; and Remembering Gallipoli: Interviews with New Zealand Gallipoli Veterans (2015), co-edited with Christopher Pugsley.\n\nCover photograph: The ship Discovery leaving Lyttelton Harbour, 1901.

Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it\u2019s going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa. Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see.

Inseparable in childhood, the brothers drifted apart as adults, brother Rocky (also O\u2019Brien) living out and proud in Portland while Roman lived a (decidedly hetero) tradie life in hometown Idaho.

Being open to these moments enhances our lives and the lives of those around us,' Dixey says.\n'In psychology, these tiny moments that stimulate positive feelings are called glimmers.'\nGold is a chemical element with the symbol Au and atomic number 79.\n'Welcome to Glimmers of Gold.'\nAbout Jo Dixey\nDixey is a Royal School of Needlework trained embroiderer. She teaches small groups a variety of embroidery techniques, works on commissions which have included large altar cloths, university banners and work for the fashion and movie industries, and repairs old embroideries.

From parliament scandals to global chaos, Nokise rips into the news cycle, mixing big laughs with bite-sized truths. This is a one-hour comedy special designed for anyone who\u2019s ever shouted at the TV, despaired at the headlines, or secretly enjoyed watching politicians squirm.\n\n\nAbout James Nokise\n\nA multi-talented comedian, playwright, columnist, podcaster, theatre maker, and social commentator, James Nokise is known for his fearless approach and his ability to give a voice to underrepresented issues.\n\nOver the course of his illustrious career James has been nominated twice for the Billy T Award (2005, 2006) and the Fred Award for Best New Zealand Show (2013), which he subsequently took out in 2019 for his show God Damn Fancy Man.

    "description": "Electrify Porirua: how to save money on your energy bills feat. Mike Casey, It keeps getting more expensive to heat our homes and water, cook our meals and get around. But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Porirua will show you how.  \nMost Porirua homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nPorirua has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Porirua.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Porirua is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

    "description": "Folk Bitch Trio \u2013 Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Folk Bitch Trio \u2013 Te Whanganui-a-Tara\nFolk Bitch Trio - 'Now Would Be A Good Time' Album Tour\nwith special guest Georgia Knight\n\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories. Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology.\n\n",

I moved to beautiful Aotearoa from Sweden a few years ago, and my journey with ceramics started in 2023 and I've been elbows deep in clay ever since. I use flora found all over the world, and outside my doorsteps, to shape my artwork. My ceramic pieces are all hand made and no piece will be the other alike. I mainly throw a shape on the wheel and then let it tell me what it wants to become.\nThis exhibition is guided by Ecclesiastes 3:1-11. I think life is beautiful in it's times of joy, but also in the times of struggle, where we can grow and learn.\nA Time for Everything\nThere is a time for everything,\nand a season for every activity under the heavens:\na time to be born and a time to die,\na time to plant and a time to uproot,\na time to kill and a time to heal,\na time to tear down and a time to build,\na time to weep and a time to laugh,\na time to mourn and a time to dance,\na time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,\na time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,\na time to search and a time to give up,\na time to keep and a time to throw away,\na time to tear and a time to mend,\na time to be silent and a time to speak,\na time to love and a time to hate,\na time for war and a time for peace.\nWhat do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.\n",

They trust each other, the audience, improv, and the moment to find their form. Nothing is decided beforehand.\n\nRich and Rebecca Sohn met as improvisers in Chicago over 30 years ago. As long-time teachers, this duo show began when former students asked them to headline a new evening of improv. Students often expressed surprise at how different their teaching styles were and took to saying \u201cyou\u2019re in the Sohn zone\u201d when seeing the couple work together.\n\nD.E.I.'s - Mo Munn & Ralph Hilaga\n\nWhen two besties land jobs at a prestigious company, they discover they\u2019re not there for their skills \u2014 they\u2019re the token hires. What follows is an improvised journey of chaos, corporate jargon, and an earnest attempt to prove they\u2019re more than just the diversity checkbox.\n\nFrom the chaotic minds of Wellington improv duo Mo and Ralph, D.E.I.\u2019s is a sharp, satirical, improvised workplace comedy about tokenism, identity, and the conundrums of modern day allyship. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what happens when the diversity quota starts talking back \u2014 this is it.\n\nAs the Sohn Zone is improvised, we cannot guarantee the presence or absence of specific content or themes beyond what is in the description above. The show may contain mature themes and language, but not gratuitously. D.E.I.'s contains strong language and adult themes, and discussions of topics like racism, queerness, and tokenism.

She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",

    "description": "The Life of Henry the Fifth, A young man, once revelling in freedom and reckless camaraderie, is thrust into the role of a king, burdened with the fate of England.\nVictory or ruin rests on his shoulders, yet his newfound power isolates him, leaving him lost, uncertain, and deeply unsettled.\nBetrayed by friends, mistrusted by his men, and taunted by those who seek his downfall, Henry\u2019s journey is both severe and profoundly relatable.\nShakespeare crafts a world where soldiers fight without knowing why, where the battlefield sees vagrants and children stand shoulder to shoulder, where uncertain rulers navigate a landscape devoid of guidance from the past. It is a world that, despite its historical setting, feels unnervingly close to our own.\nWith only ten dynamic performers, this is Henry the Fifth like never before: stripped back, sharp, and driven by the raw intensity of Shakespeare\u2019s text.\nExpect fast-paced storytelling, immersive staging, and a production that puts the audience at the heart of the battle.\nFull show duration: 95 min including a 15 min intermission.\n\u201cThis production epitomises what can be achieved when talent, teamwork, hard work, opportunity and passion combine.\u2019\u201d\nNZ Herald on The Tragedy of Macbeth ",

Our members have drawn inspiration from the beauty and variety of our own backyard: dramatic coastlines, majestic mountains, vibrant cities, and the small, fleeting details that make life unique.\nWe are also proud to display images created during our group meet-ups, workshops, and learning sessions. These gatherings are at the heart of what we do as a society, offering members the chance to connect, experiment, and grow their photographic skills in a supportive and friendly environment. The exhibition is therefore more than just a showcase of individual work \u2013 it\u2019s a reflection of the shared learning, encouragement, and passion that our community thrives on.\nVisitors can expect to see a wide range of styles and techniques, from classic black-and-white to bold digital artistry. Whether you are a seasoned photographer, someone with a casual interest in the medium, or simply curious to see the world through a different lens, there will be something here to inspire you.\nOpening Night: 29th September, 7pm (private event, by invitation only)\nPublic Viewing: 30th September onwards\nOpening Hours: 10am \u2013 6pm most days, extended to 8pm on Friday/Saturday\nWe warmly invite you to join us, explore the exhibition, and experience the world as seen through the eyes of our members. Who knows \u2013 you may even feel inspired to pick up a camera yourself and consider becoming part of the Wellington Photographic Society.\nFor more information, visit: wps.org.nz\n",

Fronted by the enigmatic Ruth Carr, her coy persona ignites while bandmates Ryan Beehre and Paul Dodge forge rib-rattling beats around her.\nTheir debut album, The 88, released in 2003, achieved gold status in New Zealand, quickly followed up by the 'I Hate Guns' EP.\nOver the following decade, the trio toured their synths and samplers from Helsinki to Hanoi crafting their own refreshing sound \u2013 storming The Crystal Method's club night in LA, the FabricLive birthday bash in London, and headlining the Hanoi Music Festival in Vietnam. Along with festivals and shows up and down Aotearoa.\nHaving been retired since 2014, we\u2019re excited to announce that Minuit are back onstage for a limited number of reunion shows.\nThese reunion performances will pay tribute to classic tunes from all four albums 'The Boy with the Aubergine Hair', 'Except You', 'Fuji', 'Menace', \u2018Aotearoa\u2019, \u2018I Hate Guns\u2019, \u2018A Room Full of Cute\u2019, 'Last Night You Saw This Band', \u201825 Bucks\u2019 \u2013 everything gets a look in, plus a couple of other surprises.\nThe show will be supported by Western Haikus and JOLA BURNS.\nMinuit has a heart.

But since we're so busy in the doing, we don't often have the time or ability to take a full day off from work to dedicate to learning new things.... and sometimes conferences can be hit and miss on content.\nLast year we created a Leader Learning & Doing Day, where you can come and co-work in the same space as a bunch of other founders and leaders, and also go to mini unconference sessions during the day that are set by you.

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation",

Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us.

    "description": "Treasury Guest Lecture with Michael Keen: IN-PERSON attendance, Join us for our special Fiscal Policy for the Future seminar\nNew Zealand faces significant long-term fiscal challenges, including the rising costs associated with an ageing population, increasing demand for public services, and the need to adapt to a changing global economy. These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand. The Trust was established to support leading tax policy thinking in New Zealand. You can read about the Trust\u2019s work here.\nAbout the presenter\nMichael (Mick) Keen is a former Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, where for over twenty years he played a central role in shaping and delivering IMF policies and advice on tax matters.\nHe has advised finance ministries in all parts of the world, including missions to over forty countries, and led the preparation of influential papers for the G20 and the Executive Board of the IMF.\nBefore joining the Fund, Mick was Professor of Economics at the universities of Essex (UK), Queens (Canada) and Kyoto, and is now Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo.\nMick was the keynote speaker at the 2014 conference on the Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand and has provided peer review for Inland Revenue\u2019s previous Long-Term Insights Briefing.\nMick has jointly authored, with Joel Slemrod, Rebellion, Rascals and Revenue \u2013 an entertaining account of how history illuminates the perennial challenges and timeless principles of taxation\u2014and how the past holds clues to solving the tax problems of today.\nAbout this seminar series\nNew ideas, innovative concepts, research evidence and expert advice are all crucial to stimulate and inform the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis and advice. Our current theme for guest lectures - Fiscal Policy for the Future - explores the role of stabilising, sustainable and effective fiscal policy. Speakers provide insights into how fiscal policy can be designed to support government to meet its current and future objectives and obligations while adapting to changing circumstances and delivering value to the New Zealand public.\nFiscal policy has a stabilising role in helping to smooth the business cycle, while sustainability in fiscal policy is foundational for resilience to both shocks and longstanding challenges, such as climate change, technological advancements, and demographic trends. Ensuring effective and value for money expenditure is important so that fiscal policy contributes to the living standards of New Zealanders, both now and in the future.\nPlease note that the views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series are those of the individual presenters. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the New Zealand Treasury or the New Zealand Government.\nFor updates and our latest research visit: www.treasury.govt.nz\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to be the first to hear about our upcoming events in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series, please SUBSCRIBE to stay up to date.",

We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

The Magnificat is a world favourite, arguably Bach's best choral piece that has transcended the ages, celebrating Luke's description of Mary's pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, the choir and orchestra perform Ritchie's Then I Understood. When a child of seven to nine, Laura Rangers sketched eight poems centred on summers at Otaki Beach, Ritchie seized the opportunity to add the musical dimension and the result are dual choirs - the Renaissance Singers split - accompanied by the Sinfonia to set off Rangers' delightful insights, so elegantly displayed. The magic that can be childhood.\n\nThe concert has a celebratory theme, it being the 50th anniversary of the choir. Thus the inclusion of Forrest's Three Nocturnes that express the wonderment involved when examining the heavens and the universe full of stars. Throughout this piece the percussionists alone from the Sinfonia provide whimsical accompaniment with a celeste providing the heavenly tones - a hit when played on the last occasion the choir sang the piece.\n\nOpening the concert will be Carl Orff's O Fortuna from his popular Carmina Burana. While O Fortuna laments the role of fate it is set in the larger piece that celebrates life with gusto.\n\nWith the performers in great form (two choristers just back from singing with the world's best choir) this concert will no doubt build the sense of celebration - full of life and wonderment.\n\nGeneral Admission $25, Concession $20, Secondary School $15,\nUnder 13 Free.\n\n",

    "description": "Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days, Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days\nThis workshop is ideal for advanced students who have already learned how to set cabochon stones. Over two three-hour sessions, 20 and 27 September, 10am-1pm, you will be given an understanding of the technique of setting faceted stones using a setting burr, hammers, punches and burnishing tools. This is the first step in learning to flush set facet cut stones so they sit below the surface of the metal.\n\nSession 1 will cover the technique, demonstrations and the basics of preparing and cutting the setting. Students will be shown how to set their stones, and may begin to do this in class, but will then go on to repeat and practice the technique in their own time.\nThey can do this at home, or for a small extra cost, can stay on at the studio to practice setting for the afternoon.\n\nSession 2 will pick up on the setting techniques, reminding and refining essential steps in the process. Troubleshooting can be covered in this class, as well as learning to clean up the settings. The principles of this setting technique will be covered in a few different scenarios, as some students may wish to take this skill into different styles or directions.\n\nThe option for students to have a half-day bench hire after class will also apply to this session.\n\nWhat is provided: class fees cover your practice metal (copper) and stones (CZ) and detailed handouts that are useful for you to take away to refer to when practising and honing your skills.\n\nCorrectly sized drills and setting burrs will be provided in class, but students must purchase their own burrs for practice after class and any future bench hires. These are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nWhat to bring: Advanced students can bring projects to set stones into, but please note the metal must be at least 2mm thick and we do not allow brass to be used as a project or practice for beginners. The metal must be copper or sterling silver.\n\nStudents should bring either a craft magnifier or magnifying lenses/glasses. If you have your own flex shaft tool you plan to use at home for drilling and setting, please also bring this along so that your tutor can advise on the best way to use it. We have two drilling machines in the studio, and these must be shared between the students, so if you have a machine, do bring it.\n\nPractice bench hire after class $20 per person (till 4pm) must be booked in advance.\n\nWorkshop fee $195, Early bird $175 till 24 August.\n\n",

ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!! This booking is for FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER\n                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cWithin the DNA is written not only our histories as individuals but the whole history of the human race \u2026 patterns of DNA that have come down to us virtually unchanged from our distant ancestors \u2013 ancestors who are no longer just an abstract entity but real people who lived in conditions very different from those we enjoy today, who survived them and brought up their children.\u201d ~ Bryan Sykes (The Seven Daughters of Eve)\nReturn to MAIN EXHIBITION WEBSITE - link coming soon",

This one is for tangata Tiriti who are deeply committed to an ethic of restoration in Aotearoa and want to go beyond an intellectual understanding.\nJoin Rebecca and Mel from The P\u0101keh\u0101 Project for this one-day workshop exploring the mahi we as tangata Tiriti can do in the journey towards a Tiriti-led future. Using practices of Haumanu, a healing-centred approach to systems change, we\u2019ll be inquiring into our own roles in reweaving the relational fabric that Te Tiriti o Waitangi offered to all people in Aotearoa, but that did not happen at the time.\nWe invite you into a space for gently inquiring into your unique place in the system rewiring itself. How do we show up where M\u0101ori are calling us to be? We'll be exploring relationality and worldview; the nervous system as map for working with activation; systemic racism, the orthodox Western worldview\u2014its whakapapa and how it shows up in ourselves, our systems and society; and our roles in restorative systems change for a Tiriti-based future. It will be interactive, embodied, and nourishing.\nLet's create islands of coherence in this turbulent world.\nWe'll host you upstairs at Vogelmorn Bowling Club, in the beautiful hills of Brooklyn, Te Whanganui-a-Tara.

Jem's debut graphic novel Folk Remedy Book 1 releases in September 2025, and she's busy working on Book 2. When not making comics you can find Jem dreaming up more story ideas and hanging out with her black cat. You can find her on social media @jemyoshioka most places (Instagram, BlueSky, TikTok, X)\nBuilding Sustainable Art Practices:\nIn 2025 it feels like it's challenging enough to survive as a person, let alone thrive as an artist. But art has the unique power to nourish us in ways nothing else can. In this workshop Jem will share some of the strategies, habits and tools she uses to fit in making graphic novels alongside full time employment without burning out. This session is practice-agnostic, and is designed to facilitate discussion about what a sustainable art practice can look like, how to build one, and how we can support each other when things are tough. No resources required but feel free to bring any notebooks or tools you use to manage your art or your time\n\nAfter that, we\u2019ll share some kai (potluck style), have a relaxed k\u014drero\nThe gathering will be held at a cozy private space in Wellington CBD, easily accessible by public transport.\nMessage us for the exact location: easternsoundcollective@gmail.com\nOr reach out on Instagram/Facebook: @easternsoundcollective\n",

    "description": "Financial Planning for Retirement, Financially successful people don\u2019t achieve their wealth by accident \u2013 they make and execute clear plans. Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".\n\n1 Day\nPresented by Paul and Mary-Ellen Gadd.",

    "description": "Intro to 2D Traditional Animation, This is a beginners course in 2D animation where you'll learn the time-honoured principles of hand-drawn animation and how to apply them to your own animation project. You may work on a project incorporating your own ideas, or if you'd rather, an assigned a project from your tutor.\n\nYour tutor, Ross Payne, is a 30-year veteran of traditional 2D animation, and loves to share his knowledge about it for you to love it as much as he does.\n\nIn each lesson there will be examples and demonstrations of the animation principles with follow up exercises to put your new skills into practice. You'll work on your project both during class and at home, applying the animation principles to your individualised project.\n\nYou can choose to draw your animation on paper then scan/capture into your device, or choose to draw your animation digitally, directly into an animation programme. whichever you choose instructions in class will be provided to give you the skills needed for this step.\n\nYou can use any device, ipad or laptop you already own (except a mobile \u2013 it's really not big enough to do good animation on). The school does not provide any digital equipment. It's important that the app/programme is installed on the student's device before the course begins, and that they have had a play on it to get used to how it works. This is so that the student is at least a little familiar with their chosen software so that it's enough to begin learning animation techniques on day one. Additional information found at our website.\n\nRoss will advise you on a variety of animation apps/programmes available online to use, ranging in price from free to not very much. Note - A computer mouse can be used for 2D animation, but digital pens are much easier to use. Prior to the course commencing, you'll receive details of recommended programmes to use for the course.\n\nSuitable for a range of ages, from teens to adults.\n\nTuesday evenings, 14 October - 2 December, 6:30-8:30 pm",

This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years. She directed One Night Band which won 'Most Original Production' at the Wellington Theatre Awards 2023, and performs regularly as both a player and musician for POPROX.\nISAAC THOMAS has been an improviser and improv musician for a decade in P\u014dneke and Whakat\u016b/Nelson. He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2025. We'll giveaway any spots remaining a few days before the first workshop of the course, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email poproximprov@gmail.com and we'll pop you on the SBL.

In 2006, he was invited to assist leading wet-plate experts in the USA and has since taught many New Zealanders this challenging process. Jane, who attended Brian\u2019s workshop in 2014, later married him in 2019 and completed a photographic project in Carterton in 2016.\nAlthough Brian retired in 2015, he returned for short-term assignments at Park Road Post and part-time work at Archive NZ, supporting film archiving until mid-2023.

We want to emphasise our values regarding generous giving and mindful taking.\n2.45-3pm\n\u2022 Close out, put away tables and clear the hall.\nThe meetings will be held regularly on the 2nd Saturday of every month in Raumati and the last Saturday of every month in Waikanae.\nFurther information:\n1. There will be a koha food box for anyone who wants to donate food or seedlings in addition to their swaps. The Crop Swap team will distribute any koha crop and left over crops to local food pantries.\n2. If you do not have any crops to swap but need fresh fruit or veges for the next week, you can bring plants, flowers, seedlings, herbs, eggs, preserves, jams, baking, liquid manure, gardening books, magazines, planting containers, sometimes even chooks who need a new home! We want this to be accessible to everyone, especially those who are struggling to put fresh fruit and veges on the table!\n\n",

John Campbell highlights some consistent themes of Brian Tamaki's Destiny Church: far-right prejudices, manifest anger, and hatred.\nIn Auckland on 21 June, Destiny Church organised a march to take \"a bold public stand for Christian values, Kiwi identity and the future of this nation\".\nOn Saturday, 13 September, Brian Tamaki attended the London \u201cUnite the Kingdom\u201d protest organised by far-right political activist Tommy Robinson that claimed to celebrate 'free speech', but also contained chants of hate, racist conspiracy theories, and Christian nationalist slogans. Among disturbing scenes, some people in the crowd ripped up a flag that read 'Secular Humanism'. To them, the very idea that people of all backgrounds and beliefs can live together with equality and respect is something to fear and destroy. For decades, the far right in the USA has painted humanism as a bogeyman, blaming it for liberal values, the rights of women, and the rights of LGBT people. It shows that those who thrive on fear are deliberately targeting the very values that underpin human rights and human dignity. Humanism is not a fringe or \u2018woke\u2019 idea. It is about fairness. It is about reason. It is about believing in the good that people are capable of when they are free to live their lives without fear or prejudice. These protests, which Brian Tamaki is supporting, are a show of force from those who wish to undo progress, to divide communities, and to undermine cherished freedoms.\nWe have a growing concern for secular values in our community. We cannot be silent. It is essential to keep compassion alive in public life and politics. After watching the documentary, we will discuss our concerns and how we might respond.\nTime: Oct 6, 2025 06:30 PM Auckland, Wellington\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/88183700512...\n",

If you missed it in the cinemas the first time round, you can now watch it from the comfort of the Newtown Community Centre!\n\nDoors open at 5pm\nFilm starts at 6pm (running time is 2 hours 4 minutes)\n\nTickets are just $25 waged / $20 unwaged (all tickets include snacks) and proceeds go toward keeping your Timebank in operation.\n\nAbout the film:\nAward-winning writer/director Miki Magasiva (The Panthers, We Are Still Here) makes his feature debut with Tin\u0101 (Samoan for \"mother\"). Samoan music teacher Mareta (Anapela Polataivao) is plunged into grief after losing her daughter in the Christchurch quakes. Mareta takes a relieving role at an elite private school, where she inspires her students to perform at a big choral competition. In the trailer Mareta faces a condescending interview at Saint Francis, and her growing relationship with \"spoiled, rich kids\" annoys a family member. Tin\u0101 was chosen to open the 2024 Hawai\u2019i International Film Festival.\n\nThe Guardian says \"It\u2019s a big-hearted tear-jerker about the power of art \u2013 and it\u2019s already breaking records in its home country, where it\u2019s received the widest-ever release for a local film and become the sixth-highest grossing New Zealand film of all time.\"\n\nThis film is rated M (contains violence, offensive language and suicide references).\n\n",

By 1917 the system had grown and 17 was rebuilt into its current form adding a set of trucks converting the tram to 8 wheels. Tram tram saw regular service until the 1940\u2019s where it was eventually use for peak time travel, before being withdrawn in the late 50\u2019s.\nIt was then sold, and taken to Bell road in Raumati on the Kapiti coast where it served as a beach hutt until the 80\u2019s where it was donated to the Wellington tramway museum for display and eventual restoration.\n2014 a conservation and restoration plan was put together, and the tram was shipped out to the Wheelwright Shop in the Wairarapa for a full body overhaul. It was transported back to the museum in 2017 and put on public display until new trucks (wheelsets) could be manufacturedby A&G price in Thames.\nSince 2019 the tram has undergone new wiring, and extensive testing and running in and is now ready to take passengers along our museum.\nTram 17 is a wonderful achievement by all\nThose involved, and we cannot wait to welcome you this Father\u2019s Day to enjoy a ride on this heritage tram, saved from the scrap heap, and then saved again from rotting away.\nPlease note: We intend to run tram 17, however due to the nature and style of the tram, its operation is weather dependent. If we deem that the tram cannot run, we will advise accordingly. ",

By 1917 the system had grown and 17 was rebuilt into its current form adding a set of trucks converting the tram to 8 wheels. Tram tram saw regular service until the 1940\u2019s where it was eventually use for peak time travel, before being withdrawn in the late 50\u2019s.\nIt was then sold, and taken to Bell road in Raumati on the Kapiti coast where it served as a beach hutt until the 80\u2019s where it was donated to the Wellington tramway museum for display and eventual restoration.\n2014 a conservation and restoration plan was put together, and the tram was shipped out to the Wheelwright Shop in the Wairarapa for a full body overhaul. It was transported back to the museum in 2017 and put on public display until new trucks (wheelsets) could be manufacturedby A&G price in Thames.\nSince 2019 the tram has undergone new wiring, and extensive testing and running in and is now ready to take passengers along our museum.\nTram 17 is a wonderful achievement by all\nThose involved, and we cannot wait to welcome you this Father\u2019s Day to enjoy a ride on this heritage tram, saved from the scrap heap, and then saved again from rotting away.\nPlease note: We intend to run tram 17, however due to the nature and style of the tram, its operation is weather dependent. If we deem that the tram cannot run, we will advise accordingly. ",

Mana is of course a sanctuary so you must check your boats for any wildlife especially ants that may have gotten in past the hatches.

His work explores the intersection of art and science, using photography to reveal the unseen and challenge conventional notions of landscape. Over the past seven years, his research has focused on developing a site-specific and responsive approach to photographic interventions within the landscape.\nDrawing inspiration from scientific 'fieldwork,' Kay\u2019s practice involves close observation and data collection, using these methods to uncover new insights into specific environments. However, his approach extends beyond the typical scientific framework by leveraging the unique possibilities of the photographic medium. This process enables him to move beyond the traditional, idealized representation of landscapes, offering deeper, more complex interpretations.\nSeptember 25, Tararua Tramping Club (4 Moncrieff St, Mt Victoria), Doors Open at 7pm\nIf you\u2019re curious about the Wellington Photographic Society, you\u2019re welcome to attend two meetings for free before deciding whether to join.

    "description": "NZIFF: Sex, Returning from last year\u2019s Festival to screen alongside the rest of his Sex Dreams Love trilogy, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s comic drama takes a candid and refreshing look at modern gender roles.\n\nThere has hardly been any investigation on contemporary male identity and sexuality as candid, insightful and hilarious as Norwegian auteur Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Sex. After winning all major laurels in Nordic cinema with his impressive fresco Beware of Children (2019), the acclaimed director and author embarkson an Oslo-set trilogy simply called Sex Dreams Love.\n\nThe first instalment opens on one of the most tantalising and unexpected preludes in recent cinema. Two chimney sweeps frankly open up to each other on a coffee break in their office: the first reveals that he dreamt of being intensely looked at by none other than David Bowie, who was inspecting him as if he was a woman; the other confesses that he recently accepted the sexual advances of a male customer who asked him to have sex with him. But both men are \u201cstraight\u201d and married to women. Here, the deft tone of the film and Haugerud\u2019s rules of the game are immediately set.\n\nA fervent admirer of Eric Rohmer\u2019s thickly scripted skirmishes of love and ethics, the Norwegian writer-director infuses irony, depth and compassion in each of his elegantly composed tableaux depicting how the two men cope with the turmoil these experiences bring to their relationships with their partners and family, but most of all with themselves. Featuring some of the brightest and funniest dialogues of 2024, Sex is a real eye-opener. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

The goal of these sessions is to spark and support the creation of AI tools and practices that best serve the aspirations of our students and wh\u0101nau, and blend well with the skills and insights of New Zealand's educators.\nPart 1:\nGenerative AI is already in Aotearoa\u2019s primary classrooms.  It is used by many teachers for planning and by \u0101konga both in and out of school.  However, policy, training, and culturally safe practice haven\u2019t always kept pace.\nIn this talk, David Coblentz will provide research-based insights into:\nteacher adoption patterns,\nwhat students say they\u2019re doing (and worrying about), and\nwhere schools are missing guidance.\nWe'll also discuss what AI sovereignty could mean in education in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nThen we can close with some practical steps for boards, leaders, kaiako, and wh\u0101nau to support constructive and equitable AI use in Years 5\u20138.\n*While the formal (and online) event will finish at 5pm, those attending in person are encouraged to stay on for snacks and drinks to share. Stay till 6pm or later, and get into the ideas more deeply, in a room full of good people.\nDavid Coblentz is a Senior Statistician at NZCER. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics, David holds advanced degrees in Biostatistics (MS), History (PhD), and International Studies (MA) from the University of Washington in Seattle. Prior to coming to NZCER and transitioning into an educational research career in 2021, David worked as a biostatistician, data analytics director, and statistical consultant. David also has university teaching experience in history. His areas of interest include data analysis and data science, history education, evaluation, and AI in education.\nPart 2 will follow within two weeks of David Coblentz's presentation. It will be an online event that features two or three local AI in education developers, talking about their current development projects.\nWe intend to record both parts and make them available via our community site - https://community.sovereignai.nz/",

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context.

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene.\nTiming:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLecture dates:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene and GIB.\nCPD points: 10\nTIMING:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLECTURE DATES:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

The group is now actively\nworking towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\nRomi Wrights\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring\nstories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke\nfestival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release\nmid to late 2025.\n\n",

    "description": "Twisted Frequency - Techno Taster, Twisted Frequency - Techno Taster\nThis year for the first of our annual pre-parties we\u2019ve gone around the country to gather a lineup of creators working at the intersections of techno, delving into influences from bass, breaks, psychedelia, club music and beyond, all underpinned by elements of dance music's most enduring genre.\n\nWe believe each one of these acts is currently pushing the needle forward for underground club culture in Aotearoa, and are thrilled to host them all together at Valhalla to push their vision across the almighty Third Eye Hi-Fi soundsystem.\n\n\nELI H\u00d8FF \u2014 Abyssal Soundworks / PHTM\n\nProducer and DJ, Eli is undoubtedly at the forefront of Aotearoa\u2019s underground dance scene.\nThose who have kept their ears tuned to the innovative underground have no doubt stumbled upon the tribalistic, psychedelic, and focused sounds emanating from the mind of Auckland-based producer Eli H\u00f8ff. With a string of releases on Berlin-based PHTM, T\u0101maki Makaurau-based Gypnotica, and an impressive catalog of self-releases, he consistently showcases his singular and original interpretation of dance music.\n\nInstagram.com/e.li\nelihoff.bandcamp.com\nabyssalsoundworks.bandcamp.com\n\n\nHUNTER \u2014 Hang the Saints / Haven\n\nRaised in Kaik\u014dura, Aotearoa, Hunter's dark and atmospheric sound often contrasts the beautiful environment she grew up in. Her direct approach to techno draws influence from heavy percussion, bold rhythm and industrial soundscapes. After spending two years finding inspiration in clubs overseas, she has returned to \u014ctautahi with a refined style that\u2019s ready to make people dance. As the co-founder of \u201cHang The Saints\u201d and resident of \u201cHaven\u201d, Hunter is all about creating safe, inclusive spaces for people to connect through the music she loves.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sspoonsnake/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hunter-mccrory-334790608\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/bC3qeA6pUxBoMo7P9\n\n\nLUDUS & RIZZO \u2014 Tonic Collective\n\nTonic Collective is the recent endeavour of Ludus and Rizzo, inspired by the people, places and spaces of their experience touring China with BIRDPARTY and Vera Ellen. Both acts are individually known for their versatile and innovative sound, bringing a wide range of influences and inspirations to the dancefloor. In the short time since establishing the collective, they\u2019ve already hosted Kaishandao and Bone Chapel, established a space, and debuted a monthly radio show on Mouthfull that explores sound from across the genre spectrum, both in the club and out.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ludus.etc/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alicerizzoofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tonic.collective/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/l-s-rizzo/416life-support-cl1n1c-chengdu\nhttps://soundcloud.com/racquetclub-info/mix-series-016-ludus\n\n\nSHLI \u2014 Echo Train Records / Warehouse Rave / Holding Hands\n\nShli is the alias of \u014ctautahi-via-P\u014dneke DJ and Producer Tim Ward. Steadily releasing works over recent years through local labels like Echo Train and the Big Fresh Collective, he is carving out a sound of his own.\n\nStitching together infectious rhythms layered over low-end pressure, Shli\u2019s sets draw influence from across the hardcore continuum and beyond. Creating dancefloor moments from trippy rhythmic states to unleashing sheer bass weight.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/____shli/\nhttps://echotrainer.bandcamp.com/album/ech009-bracing-set-pace-u-dont\nhttps://soundcloud.com/1shli\n\n",

    "description": "Secrets, Orchestra Wellington\u2019s 2025 season, The Dictator\u2019s Shadow,\nfollows Dmitri Shostakovich\u2019s career, tracing his trajectory as a\nbrilliant young composer catapulted to early fame and then hurled into danger.\nThe next chapter in our story is Secrets, featuring an array of bold works and exciting talent! As we continue our exploration of Dmitri Shostakovich's journey 50 years after his death, we present his fourth symphony. The work, was meant to be his boldest statement yet \u2014 but the composer withdrew it before its premiere. Why? The whispers were clear: this music would not please the authorities. It stayed hidden for decades, a secret too dangerous to share.\nWe partner with At The World's Edge Music Festival (AWE) to present the stunning talents of soloists Benjamin Baker (violin) and Yura Lee (viola) in a performance of Mozart\u2019s luminous Sinfonia Concertante. This work offers a moment of balance \u2014 a conversation between violin and viola, full of warmth and understanding, reminding us of beauty even in troubled times.\nWith generous support from the Orchestra Wellington Foundation we also reveal a brand-new secret: the world premiere of \"House of the Faun\" by WIlliam Philipson, the 2025 SOUNZ Commission for Orchestra and Sistema Youth Orchestra | Te Tono Mahinga a SOUNZ m\u0101 te R\u0101ngi Puoro me te R\u0101ngi Puoro Taiohi a Sistema. The work is designed to showcase the young musicians of Arohanui Strings+ by setting their playing against the full orchestra in a rich and immersive musical landscape. ",

And what should we actually be doing about it?\n\nAfterwards, stick around for a plant-based dinner and dessert \u2014 fresh, colourful, and made to share.

He brings ancient Vedic teachings to life, effortlessly navigating the latest research in archaeology, consciousness, ancient history, neuroscience, social science, and psychology.

His sound on the instrument is so unique and special, it\u2019s been a touchstone for me for years. I remember being absolutely captivated by his playing on the untitled originals when Both Directions at Once came out, when I was still a beginner player. My Favourite Things is one of my most loved albums, and Everytime We Say Goodbye from that record is some of my favourite saxophone playing ever.\u2019\n\nThe band will play classics such as My Favourite Things and Greensleeves, as well as tunes from the albums Both Directions at Once, Duke Ellington & John Coltrane, and Impressions.\n\nPersonnel:\nAlex Trask \u2013 soprano saxophone\nDuncan Haynes \u2013 piano\nElijah Mulheron \u2013 bass\nRick Cranson \u2013 drums\n\nPart of the Wellington Jazz Festival 2025",

We have secured the one and only COKI for an intimate warehouse rave at an inner city location.\n\nThis legend of bass needs no introduction, but we\u2019ll give him one anyway. As one half of DIGITAL MYSTIKZ, Coki has made sine waves move like no other, architecting much of the sonic blueprint that modern dubstep has become known for. Alongside Mala, he helped forge the DMZ sound and is now making his way to Wellington for a rare showcase of pure low-frequency warfare. Expect heavyweight pressure, bone-rattling subs, and that unmistakable Coki wobble - this is dubstep in its rawest form.\n\nOn support we have drawn for the best of the best. Opening up proceedings we have BABETECH, champion selector and vibe master. Since murking opening slots for Loefah, Filth and Kahn & Neek as well as spreading the gospel of bass for countless evenings on RadioActive, we can\u2019t think of a better opener for this night.\n\nFollowing that, we have dubstep extraordinaire DUSTY warming things up with his signature and gruelling take on the classic dubstep sound. With releases on Infernal Sounds and Leather Kennel, Dusty has proven himself to be a force to be reckoned with, and is surely one of the most exciting young producers in the game today.\n\nOn closing duties we have the Support Your Local crew going b2b with Young Gho$t to round out the night with a bit of silliness.\n\nWe\u2019ve managed to secure an all-new inner city warehouse location for this one, and its Further Sound on soundsystem duties this time, heating things up with their BANSHEE SOUNDSYSTEM, preparing for only its second full rollout after Cuba Dupa this year.\n\nWe\u2019re unbelievably excited to share this space with you all for a dance and are expecting this to be one for the books.Secure your tickets now and don\u2019t miss out on this momentous and legendary dance music event!\n\nTickets: https://events.humanitix.com/coki-uk-warehouse-rave\n\n",

(our venue address will be emailed with your ticket).\n\nThis is a space for men to talk honestly, listen deeply, and figure some things out together. It\u2019s not about having it all sorted. You don\u2019t need to be a certain type of guy. Just show up as you are, with no pressure to speak or share.\nOpen group: new faces are welcome\nFlexible: book to come when it suits you. Each Tuesday is a new event. Most will try for fortnightly.\nSmall groups: 8 men + 2 experienced hosts\nInclusive: all ages, backgrounds and identities (18+)\nIt's about connection and showing up, instead of going it alone. It makes time for meeting our various challenges, while learning and growing us into better friends, partners, dads, sons and humans. \nIt isn\u2019t a boys or bros club, therapy or a self-help seminar, religious or new-age. No fixing, preaching, or pressure. It\u2019s not a crisis service or a substitute for professional care. The sign-up form explains this in more detail.\nYou can expect to:\nPractice listening and learn communication skills for life\nDiscover greater integrity and self-accountability\nBe supported in building your emotional intelligence\nBecome a part of a hearty and diverse community\nHave a good time - it\u2019s often uplifting and inspiring.\nJoseph and your team of hosts have all been in regular men's groups for many years. The group sometimes offers simple and proven inquiries that draw on NVC, MBSR, active listening, gratitude and more.",

    "description": "Film screening: GAGA, Film screening: GAGA\nJoin us for a special screening of the 2022 Taiwanese comedy-drama film GAGA, featuring a Q&A with the award-winning Director, Laha Mebow\n\nAbout this Event\n\nGaga\u300a\u54c8\u52c7\u5bb6\u300b(2022)\nDirected by Laha Mebow 112 mins, Mandarin/Atayal/Taiwanese, English subtitles\nAmong the Atayal indigenous people of Taiwan, gaga is the traditional law and custom, the way of living with the land and organising society, the source of values. When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi!

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

Since we will be viewing and discussing potentially sensitive topics, the event will have an Open Door Policy, which means that you may leave the venue any time, for any reason, and will not be judged for doing so.\nWHAT IS MARTIAL LAW?\n\"Martial law refers to the replacement of civil rule by military rule. This may be characterized by curfews, the dispensation of military tribunal rulings on civilians, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, which in Latin refers to \u201chaving the body\u201d, is a citizen\u2019s protection against unlawful imprisonment. This is suspended in times of crisis to expedite justice\" (Martial Law Museum).\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY?\nHuman rights violations and extrajudicial killings are still on-going in the Philippines under President Bongbong Marcos, the son of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. who proclaimed Martial Law in 1972, and Vice President Sara Duterte, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte who spearheaded the violent War on Drugs in 2016 (Karapatan).\nWHY WOULD I WANT TO JOIN THE FILM SCREENING?\nThe film screening is for anyone who is keen to learn about the Martial Law Era, wants to share their experience during the Martial Law (or something similar) through group discussion, wants to meet new people, wants to watch a Philippine film/documentary, or just wants to have snacks.\nI WANT TO JOIN BUT I'M FROM T\u0100MAKI MAKAURAU / CHRISTCHURCH / THE PHILIPPINES.\nWe will stream the film through Zoom for viewers outside Te Whanganui-a-Tara, however, there may be internet and other technical difficulties during the event itself. Also please make sure to select the \"Online\" ticket option when RSVPing.\nHOW MUCH IS THE TICKET?\nThe film screening is free but we appreciate koha for the venue/snacks/donations to Philippine non-governmental organisations (NGOs).\nNOTE: This is an LGBTQ+ friendly event.",

Through the stories of a straight woman and a gay man, Haugerud defies conventions with humor and compassion, in an eloquent and moving masterwork on human relations in the 21st century.\n\nWhat is love? The age-old question finds a contemporary and adult declination in Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s final chapter to his Sex Dreams Love trilogy, premiered to universal acclaim at the Venice Film Festival 2024.\n\nLong, bright Oslo summer days form the backdrop as two medical colleagues, one straight, the other gay, follow parallel trajectories in the games of love, attraction, sex and empathy. Meeting by chance on a ferry, the two describe their searches for intimacy. Marianne is into dating and is looking for love, Tor is looking for sex \u2013 by cruising for men on dating apps as he rides to and fro on the ferries. Through Haugerud\u2019s effortlessly unpredictable writing, the ferry turns into a magic vessel where the destinies of these two take unexpected turns\u2026\n\nWith Love, Haugerud questions conventions with detached humor, yet he always treats his characters with profound compassion, delivering an eloquent and moving masterpiece on human relationships in the 21st century. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

H\u00e9ctor is not. When she tells them she\u2019s pregnant, her own parents can\u2019t hide their shock \u2013 loving but concerned that their daughter will be unable to tackle the task of motherhood. Will the baby be born deaf? Uncertainty abounds as the due date draws closer, and it\u2019s not just \u00c1ngela\u2019s parents who are beginning to have doubts.\n\nThe foundations for the film\u2019s narrative derive from the personal experiences of first-time actor Miriam Garlo, Libertad\u2019s own sister, as she began to contemplate motherhood as a deaf woman. When surrounded by her other deaf friends, \u00c1ngela is comfortable, alive, vibrant within a community that supports her. Around the local mums in the park, or her husband\u2019s friends, isolation sets in with a painful immediacy that anyone who has ever struggled to understand the language in a foreign country will know all too well. A poignant story bound by the chemistry of its leads, deafness is woven into the film as a lived experience, not a defining label. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

It seems he\u2019ll never have the chance to work through his complicated feelings towards his twin until stumbling upon a bereavement group for just such a purpose.\n\nThere he meets Dennis (James Sweeney). Neurotic, sarcastic, gay, he\u2019s the opposite that attracts as the pair bond over trauma and a deep need for attachment. They quickly become each other\u2019s emotional support twin-surrogate, on call for late night grocery trips, afterwork bitch sessions, and road trip singalongs. But odd couple bliss can\u2019t last, as Dennis has more than friendship in mind, Roman grapples with explosive anger issues, and dark secrets inevitably come to light.\n\nSweeny\u2019s sophomore effort as writer, director, and co-star walks an entertaining balance between discomfort and hilarity. With finely calibrated performances from both leads, Twinless is witty, warped, and surprisingly warm hearted. \u2014 Adrian Hatwell",

    "description": "Reels for Meals: Prime Minister, September's Reels for Meals movie fundraiser is Prime Minister.\nIn August 2017, in the lead-up to national elections, Jacinda Ardern unexpectedly became New Zealand\u2019s opposition party leader. She had just turned 37. Two frenetic months later, she was Prime Minister. Just before the final vote was in, she discovered she was pregnant. She would become only the second head of state in history to give birth while in office.\nArdern quickly became one of the most recognisable leaders in the world. She drew global attention from people craving a sensitive and compassionate approach to the critical issues of our time. In private, she struggled with being a mother and proving herself to a public skeptical of women\u2019s leadership. A series of crises - the Christchurch massacre, pandemic lockdowns, and disinformation-fueled protests outside Parliament - would test that leadership and the feminine touch she brought to it. She resigned from office in January 2023, shocking her supporters and critics alike.\nGoing behind the scenes of her administration and her private life, Prime Minister follows Jacinda for seven years as she is catapulted to the top of New Zealand politics, becomes a feminist political icon, resigns suddenly from office and continues to champion the fight against isolationism, fear, and the distortion of truth. Intimate home footage shot by her husband and audio interviews that Jacinda did while in office give us unparalleled access. Along with in-depth contemporaneous interviews, these form the emotional backbone of the story, giving viewers an unfiltered window into her years in power.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

Off the back of a monstrous summer, which saw them play 19 shows up and down the country, the pair have spent most of 2025 in the studio finessing their own brand of audio alchemy and preparing to release their label, also named XCOMMUNICATE.\n\nUsually XCOMMUNICATE is a 6 hour journey though decades and sonic realms, however as Heylady is still recovering from a mighty dose of burnout they\u2019ve roped in a couple of their good friends, who happen to be some of Wellington\u2019s finest, to join them as they lay down four hours of four to the floor.\n\nHalo is a mainstay on Wellington dancefloors and it was a no brainer asking her to be on this lineup. A DJ since 2000, she has played festivals across the country and never fails to rock her slot. Her set at Taniwha\u2019s Den last summer was a big highlight and one of the best of the festival. Halo\u2019s ability to drive forward thinking sound and her clever construction of sets are just two reasons you need to be on her floor.\n\nDJ Coda is the godfather of techno in New Zealand. With a career that spans decades, he isn\u2019t just a DJ but a dedicated promoter and one of the trustees of NZ\u2019s longest running student radio station, Radio Active. Part of the COMMUNICATE family from the get go (and a longtime collaborator of Heylady\u2019s), DJ Coda is a master of his craft and never fails to deliver. Armed with knowledge , taste and a hefty love of Detroit, DJ Coda is the man when it comes to rocking the dance floor.\nFirst release tickets are on sale now, grab yours before they are gone and come and dance the evening away with four of the best. We recommend arrive early so you don\u2019t miss out on any of the sets, they are all going to be killer.\n\nIMPORTANT INFO:\nOur event is a safe space for all. If you or someone you know is feeling unsafe or harassed, please approach one of the DJs or bar staff. If you are behaving badly and impacting others ability to have a good time safely, you will be removed. Please act with respect and care for your fellow attendees at all times, no means no and this goes for conversations as well as more intimate requests.\n\n",

Dr Barrie has recently revamped the Glendronach lineup, and we're going to see how she's doing: we'll try the previous 12 and 15 year--old bottlings against her new releases.

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

What next?, Rutherford House (by the train station)\nRoom RHLT2\nBunny Street\nWellington\n1.30-4.30pm\nFree Admission\nLight refreshments afterward\nThe NZ Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 (MoDA) has failed to deliver. Data from the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime indicated the demand for drugs is greater than ever, while the supply of drugs knows no bounds.\nA failure acknowledged globally and one we witness first hand here in Aotearoa NZ.\nBack in 2011 a comprehensive review of the MoDA conducted by New Zealand Law Commission had already concluded the MoDA \u201cshould be repealed and replaced by a new Act \u2026administered by the Ministry of Health\u201d.\nThe Harm Reduction Coalition of Aotearoa wants to see that recommendation enacted.\nWe are delighted to have assembled a group of respected independent thinkers in the field, with vast experience of drug policy in Aotearoa and beyond, to reflect on the impact of the MoDA and to identify the principles and values needed to underpin new drug laws.\nWarren Young\nProfessor of Law & Former Deputy President New Zealand Law Commission\nKirsten Gibson\nChair of Harm Reduction Coalition Aotearoa and Qualitative Researcher\nFiona Hutton\nAssociate Professor, Institute of Criminology, Victoria University of Wellington\nAdam Dorsett\n40 Years Living Experience of Prohibited Drug Use, in Prison for 25 years\nJulian Buchanan\nFormer UNODC Advisor and Criminology Professor\nNew Zealand has a history for world leading innovative policy reform: Woman\u2019s Right to Vote; Decriminalisation of Sex Work; National Needle Exchange, Same Sex Marriage and most recently Drug Checking.\nThis half day symposium will provide clear evidence why major law reform is necessary and detail the foundations upon which Aotearoa NZ can once again lead the way with new drug laws based on evidence, research and experience.\nWe look forward to seeing there!\nDo pass on to anyone who might be interested.

    "description": "Teaching Well - Supportive schools for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), With the growing emphasis on staff wellbeing there is a plethora of workplace mental wellbeing programmes on offer. However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages. In fact, the staff consultation is, in itself, is a wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 30% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions.

He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing.

Gamma brainwaves are associated with states of deep meditation, heightened awareness, and higher brain functions.\n\nBreathwork and other deeply meditative practices activate gamma waves and there is a correlation between gamma waves and DMT release, with one seeming to stimulate the other.\n\nBreathwork experiences and benefits so often parallel those of DMT and other psychedelic plant-medicines, DMT is produced naturally in the brain, and is released during Breathwork.\n\n\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude46 \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4e:\n\n\u2022 Anxiety, depression and stress\n\n\u2022 Increase energy & boost immunity\n\n\u2022 Improves sleep\n\n\u2022 Lowers blood pressure & improves circulation\n\n\u2022 Improves mood & self esteem & helps manage depression\n\n\u2022 Relese toxins\n\n\u2022 Helps manage pain & restrictions in the body\n\n\u2022 Releasing trauma & emotion & manage PTSD\n\n\u2022 Gaining body awareness\n\n\u2022 Connecting to intuition and receiving guidance\n\n\u2022 Past life clearing and understanding\n\n\u2022 Spiritual awakening and expansion\n\n\u2022 Karmic release and ancestral work\n\n\u2022 Increasing creativity and self-expression\n\n\u2022 Life purpose clarity\n\nA breathwork journey is unique to each person and and the results are profound.\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a \ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4f:\n\n\u2022 Doors will open at 11.45am and you will have a few moments to get grounded and set up for your \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b experience.\n\n\u2022 We will open up with an introduction to this \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b technique and prepare to start the Breathwork Medicine Journey.\n\n\u2022 You will then be guided through a 90 minute experience recieving healing & expansion bridging the gap between your human self & higher self.\n\n\u2022 Your only job is to be open minded, relax, and let your breath guide you on this medicine journey be open to receive any healing or guidance that comes up throughout the journey.\n\n\u2022 We will close of with an intergration circle finishing up at 2.30PM leaving light grounded and open and with feelings one oneness connected to the universe.\n\n\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude68:\n\nBreathwork results in certain specific physiological changes in the body and also can result in intense physical and emotional release.\n\nAs a precaution, the following conditions are contraindicated in certain breathwork practices.\n\nIt is crucial that you inform your breathwork practitioner if any of the following conditions are relevant to you:\n\n\u2022 Pregnancy (at any stage)\n\n\u2022 Severe PTSD or trauma\n\n\u2022 Currently using recreational drugs\n\n\u2022 Recent surgery\n\n\u2022 Taking any medication that alters brain chemistry like anti-anxiety,anti-depressant, ADD, OCD medications, etc.\n\n\u2022Detached Retina\n\n\u2022Glaucoma\n\n\u2022Kidney disease\n\n\u2022High Blood Pressure\n\n\u2022Cardiovascular disease, including angina, previous heart attack or stroke\n\u2022Diagnosis of aneurysm in the brain or abdomen\n\n\u2022Uncontrolled thyroid conditions\n\n\u2022Diabetes\n\n\u2022Severe Asthma\u2014 for mild to moderate asthma, we can discuss but you must bring your inhaler to the session.\n\n\u2022 Epilepsy\n\n\u2022 History of Seizures\n\n\u2022 Prior diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or previous psychiatric condition.\n\n\u2022Any other medical, psychiatric or physical conditions which would impair or affect the ability to engage in any activities that involve deep physical and/or emotional release.\n\n\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4c\u2019\ud835\ude68:\n\nWhat can I expect?\n\nThere will be a short guided meditation, explanation of conscious connected breathwork (how to do it, tetany, things that may happen etc), a full 60 min breathwork journey and space afterwards for a few to share about their experience and any questions asked and support given if needed.\n\nI have one or more of the listed contraindications -

    "description": "Breathwork: A Gentle Reset, Breathwork: A Gentle Reset\nBreathwork: A Gentle Reset\n\nTake a pause from the noise of daily life.\n\nThis breathwork journey begins with gentle movement to awaken the body and open the breath. Through slow, mindful stretches, we begin softening tension and grounding into the present.\n\nYou\u2019ll then be guided through two styles of breathwork \u2014 each offering a unique pathway inward. There\u2019s no pressure or expectation, just the freedom to explore what feels right for you:\n\nA dynamic, connected breath for those who wish to build energy, move emotion, or break through internal blockages\n\nA slow, rhythmic breath for those seeking stillness, calm, and deeper grounding\n\nBoth approaches invite a sense of spaciousness \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally \u2014 while supporting nervous system balance and inner clarity.\n\nTo gently close the session, we\u2019ll move into a quiet, nurturing meditation to support integration and leave you feeling steady, clear, and connected.\n\nAfterwards, stay and enjoy a nourishing plant-based dinner and dessert, lovingly prepared to complement the experience \u2014 because healing is also about how we feed and care for ourselves.\n\nWhy Breathwork?\n\nBreathwork has helped so many shift from a state of tension and overwhelm into a place of ease, clarity, and resilience \u2014 often after just one session. It\u2019s a simple, powerful practice that reconnects you to your body, your breath, and your inner stillness.\n\nYou\u2019ll leave feeling more grounded, more present, and more like yourself again.\n\nMeet Karla, your host\nKarla is a breathwork and trauma-somatic facilitator based in Aotearoa (New Zealand), originally from Malta. With over a decade of experience in Reiki and three years facilitating trauma-informed, science-based breathwork, Karla combines holistic tools, meditation, and conscious breathing to support nervous system regulation and deep emotional healing. Her offerings help release stored trauma, reduce stress and anxiety, and activate oxytocin\u2014the \u201clove hormone\u201d\u2014fostering connection, vitality, and a sense of wholeness.

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

Insights that very few others trainers or training programs in this country provide. He has had an interest on the impact of social exclusion, alienation and discrimination on mens's wellbeing and advocates for a human rights based, systems change and person-centred approach to wellbeing.The workshop is enriched by the learnings from Barry's own lived experience of depression and suicidality and his pathway to recovery.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to effectively respond to the unacceptably high rate of male suicide in this country.\n\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

At Wellington Classic Literature Group we read novels that have stood the test of time, whether they were written in 1780, 1880 or even 1980. The group has been running for more than a decade and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers that come along for particular books or simply when it suits. We meet on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nOur November book, and first work of poetry, is Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet (1923). Born in Lebanon in 1883 and later emigrating to the United States, Kahlil Gibran bridged East and West. His writings, poetry and art explore themes of love, spirituality and humanity.\n\nThe Prophet, his classic work of prose poetry, has been translated into more than 100 languages and is one of the best-selling books of all time. It has never gone out of print.\n\nProject Gutenberg link for those e-reading:\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/58585\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place.

While there\u2019s no obligation to stay for dinner, sharing a meal together offers a meaningful way to strengthen connections. Andre and Sri Jiva co-host this circle with a shared passion for creating authentic, supportive spaces where men can connect deeply\u2014offering this gathering simply because they believe in its importance.\n\nThe Men\u2019s Circle provides a safe and nurturing environment where men can share openly, express their feelings, and encourage personal growth\u2014free from societal pressures to be stoic or self-reliant. Through honest sharing and collective support, participants build resilience, deepen self-awareness, and strengthen their sense of identity and purpose.\n\nStructure of the Circle\n\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.\n\nA short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\n\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center. Only the person holding the object may speak, ensuring uninterrupted sharing.\n\nOpen Sharing: Anyone may choose to share while holding the object. Sharing is optional, and passing is always respected.\n\nActive Listening: While one person shares, others listen attentively without speaking, interrupting, or offering advice. The focus is on witnessing and being present.\n\nNo Judgments or Advice: Participants refrain from judging or offering unsolicited advice, creating a safe space for authentic expression.\n\nClosing: The circle may conclude with a group reflection, a moment of gratitude, or a simple acknowledgment of the shared experience.\n\nCircle Agreements\n\nSupportive Environment: We are here to uplift and support one another, fostering trust and brotherhood.\n\nFocus on the Present: Share what's alive for you now, focusing on your emotions and experiences to deepen emotional awareness.\n\nUse \"I\" Statements: Speak from your personal perspective using \"I\" statements to promote authenticity and responsibility. Avoid generalizations like \"we\" or \"us.\"\n\nNo Judgment or fixing: Refrain from judging others sharing or offering unsolicited advice, ensuring a safe and non-critical space.\n\nConfidentiality: What is shared in the circle stays in the circle. You may discuss your own experience outside the group, but keep others' details private.\n\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\n\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\n\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n................................................................................................\n\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

    "description": "Exploring our shared humanity, Join experienced psychotherapist Rohit Grover for a six-week course that invites you to look beyond the surface of everyday life. In these two-hour sessions, we will explore the core tenets of existential therapy, moving away from the conventional focus on self and hedonism. Instead, we'll grapple with life's big questions:\nWhat does it truly mean to live a value-driven life?\nDo our personal values matter, or is the search for meaning just an illusion?\nWhat is the \"being\" part of \"human being\" all about?\nThrough guided discussions, reflective exercises, and insights from classic existential thinkers, Rohit will help you navigate this profound territory. This isn't about finding easy answers. It's about developing the courage to ask the right questions, to confront the realities of freedom, responsibility, and meaning, and to discover a more authentic way of living.\nThis course is for anyone ready to step off the treadmill and begin a deeper exploration of what it means to be alive. Come and find out what it means to truly exist\nUpon completion of this course, participants will be able to:\nDifferentiate between a life driven by external pressures or fleeting pleasures and one rooted in personal values and authentic meaning.\nIdentify and critically examine the core existential givens of human existence, such as freedom, responsibility, isolation, and the search for meaning.\nArticulate a personal understanding of what it means to \"be\" a human being, moving beyond a purely functional or biological definition.\nArrive at sensing rather than thinking. Sensing this existence, this dance of life. Widen your view of existence.\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".",

Whether you are single or partnered, whether your past experiences were harmonious or painful, each relationship reflects the inner dance of the masculine and feminine within us.\n\nThroughout history, these sacred energies\u2014Yin and Yang\u2014were meant to complement and support each other. Yet, distortions, suppression, and separation have created wounds that echo through generations. Many of us carry beliefs such as:\n\nMen cannot be trusted.\nWomen are not safe.\nLove must be earned.\n......\n\nRarely do we pause to sit with these wounds and meet the unhealed parts of our inner feminine and masculine. These energies may hold not only personal pain but also ancestral imprints passed down through time\u2014shaping the way we experience love and connection today.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f In this mini workshop, you will be guided through a shamanic journey to explore and heal your inner archetypes. Together, we will:\n\n\u2728 Release old wounds and limiting patterns carried by the inner feminine or masculine.\n\u2728 Make peace with the shadow side of our psyche.\n\u2728 Embody the wholeness of the Divine Masculine and Feminine within.\n\nWe will close our circle with a sacred forgiveness ritual, bridging the separation and returning to a state of balance, wholeness, and love.\n\nThis journey is open to everyone\u2014whether you are new to shamanic work or have walked this path before. All that is required is an open heart and willingness to connect deeply within.\n\n\ud83c\udf38 You\u2019ll leave with:\n\nA renewed sense of love and harmony within yourself.\nGreater balance between your inner masculine and feminine.\nA deeper connection to spirit, self, and the essence of oneness.\n\nEvent Details\n\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, September 21st\n\ud83d\udd52 3:00\u20136:00 pm\n\ud83d\udccd Lotus Yoga Centre \u2013 Sanctuary, Paraparaumu\n\ud83d\udcab Energy Exchange: $55 per person\n\ud83c\udf3f Limited to 12 participants\n\n\u2728What to bring:\nA water bottle, journal, cushion or blanket for comfort.\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Rides from Wellington may be arranged\u2014please contact me if needed.Contact: 0272541272\n\nAbout Your Guide - Fery Qiu\n\nI am a Shamanic Healer who is committed to the healing path that help people heal from the core of their being. From suicidal depression to shamanic path, my spirituality is not based on how many trainings, meditations, and ceremonies I have done, it\u2019s coming from a deep embodied experience to transform pain into wisdom and empowerment. The shamanic path is a way of being; we allow ourselves to go deeper within to connect all things that come from oneness. I loved my work, which has been proven to help people really change their lives. If you are curious about what this mini workshop could bring, having an open mind and open heart, you will be surprised by how much can be done just in this brief journey within.\n\n\n\nWith love,\nFery Qiu\n\n",

    "description": "Teaching Well - A supportive school for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), Growing attention to staff wellbeing has resulted in many workplace mental wellbeing initiatives. Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme.

    "description": "Hands-on Sourdough Workshop (Neil's), Sourdough for Beginners - $120 (paid via internet banking)\nCome join us for a hands-on, in-person sourdough workshop at Willow Corner Collective headquarters (aka my home)! This workshop is currently the only hands-on sourdough workshop being offered in the Nelson region - I teach and demonstrate to you and then you get to mix and practice on your own dough as we go along.\nWhether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this event is perfect for anyone looking to master the art of making sourdough bread, learning from someone who has 10+ years of experience. Perhaps you've found all the Youtube tutorials and Instagram how-to's overwhelming and are keen to learn via an in-person class. Then this is for you! I've baked hundreds of loaves in the last year alone, sold at a market, and hosted a pop-up shop. However, my passion really lies with teaching others to bake their own sourdough in their own homes, for their own families (or small businesses - one day!).You will be taught, demonstrated to, and then you get to have a go yourself; whilst learning my tips and tricks along the way. Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes and troubleshoot guide\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 6-8pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. If for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though.

Please pay immediately upon purchasing ticket.\n**All workshop info you need to know ahead of time is in the confirmation email. Please ensure you read this down to the bottom.\n***I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight! From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody",

    "description": "NZIFF: Deaf, A woman navigates the experience of motherhood as a deaf person in a hearing world in Eva Libertad\u2019s crowd-pleasing, feel-good drama which collected the Panaroma Audience Award at Berlin this year.\n\nBased on the award-winning short of the same name, Spanish filmmaker Eva Libertad\u2019s debut follows couple \u00c1ngela and H\u00e9ctor as they make the transition into parenthood. \u00c1ngela is deaf. H\u00e9ctor is not. When she tells them she\u2019s pregnant, her own parents can\u2019t hide their shock \u2013 loving but concerned that their daughter will be unable to tackle the task of motherhood. Will the baby be born deaf? Uncertainty abounds as the due date draws closer, and it\u2019s not just \u00c1ngela\u2019s parents who are beginning to have doubts.\n\nThe foundations for the film\u2019s narrative derive from the personal experiences of first-time actor Miriam Garlo, Libertad\u2019s own sister, as she began to contemplate motherhood as a deaf woman. When surrounded by her other deaf friends, \u00c1ngela is comfortable, alive, vibrant within a community that supports her. Around the local mums in the park, or her husband\u2019s friends, isolation sets in with a painful immediacy that anyone who has ever struggled to understand the language in a foreign country will know all too well. A poignant story bound by the chemistry of its leads, deafness is woven into the film as a lived experience, not a defining label. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

Matariki is also visible at this time close to the line of planets.\nCome down to the Wellington waterfront at dawn and see the planets Pare\u0101rau (Saturn), K\u014dp\u016b/T\u0101wera (Venus), Hine-i-t\u012bweka (Jupiter), Whiro (Mercury), and Matariki (Pleiades) in our skies. Rangip\u014d (Uranus) and Tangaroa (Neptune) are also in the sky but they will be too faint to see. Matawhero (Mars) follows after Te R\u0101 (the Sun) rises so it won't be seen in the sky.\nIf you want to gaze in wonder at Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, look through our amazing telescopes!

Most props are provided but feel free to bring your own yoga mat for extra comfort as well as a cushion, blanket, socks and an eye pillow if you have one.\n\nThis class is suitable for all - no previous experience is required.\n\nLIMITED SPACES AVAILABLE.\nTWILIGHT SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/5a2pad44\nMORNING SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/mw82z38u\n\nRestorative yoga is a practice of deep relaxation in which yoga poses (asanas) are held for several minutes with the use of props such as blocks, bolster and blankets to support the body in gentle stretch.\n\nWhen your body enters a state of relaxation, your mind will also relax. Once you have been guided to let go of any tension held in your body, all that is required is for you to pay attention to your breath, becoming aware of any thoughts that may arise, and then gently releasing them.\n\nThis restful practice calms both mind and body, allowing the nervous system to enter its parasympathetic state \u2013 the state of \u201crest and digest\u201d, in which healing is enabled and enhanced.\n\nAbout Cacao\nCacao is a superfood. It is plant medicine at its finest. Its scientific name, Theobroma cacao, translates to \"food of the Gods.\" Containing many minerals, vitamins and phytonutrients such as flavonoids and antioxidants, it is also an extremely potent adaptogen that encourages the body to come into balance.\n\nCacao has a particularly strong influence on the heart \u2013 both physiologically and energetically. Cacao anecdotally is reported to enhance connection in community, hence its beauty in being shared in circle.\n\nIn Jenny's experience, cacao seems to enhance whatever it is that you are doing \u2013 be it running a marathon or meditating \u2013 cacao can make you go deeper, further, longer, stronger. However she does seem to have a mind of her own so be open to the experience she offers you \u2013 it may not always go quite how you planned!\n\nCacao is very safe and tolerated well by most people. However it is to be used with caution by people who are taking high doses of SSRIs. Cacao releases serotonin, so it works as a mild antidepressant. When taken with SSRIs that release serotonin chemically it can lead to serotonin syndrome. Individuals taking MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should avoid consuming ceremonial cacao due to potential interactions.\n\nThis workshop is part of Pukerua Bay Hub's 2025 Pop-up Parlour - thanks for your support.\n\n____________________________________\nWHAT IS THE POP-UP PARLOUR?\nA chance to create and connect in our pop-up community space. From 1-30 September we've got a jam-packed schedule with 65+ events for kids, families, rangatahi and adults to learn, hang out and have fun.\n\nCheck out all the free/koha events too -\nhttps://www.pkbhub.org.nz/whatson\n\nWaiho i te toipoto, kaua i te toi roa \u2013\nLet us keep close together, not far apart.\n\n",

    "description": "Book Club: Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",

At Wellington Classic Literature Group we read novels that have stood the test of time, whether they were written in 1780, 1880 or even 1980. The group has been running for more than a decade and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers that come along for particular books or simply when it suits. We meet on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nOur October book is Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly. The work changed American hearts and minds about slavery.\n\nThe influence of Uncle Tom's Cabin was so immense that the story arose that when Abraham Lincoln welcomed Stowe to the White House during the American Civil War he reportedly declared, \"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\"\n\nIn the US, it was the best-selling novel of the 19th century and the second best-selling book of all after the Bible.\n\nProject Gutenberg link for those e-reading:\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/203\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place.

It\u2019s also just a different & cool way of meeting new people by getting a bit out of your comfort zone and skipping the small talk!\nJoin us for games, talks, and connections with friends you haven\u2019t met yet. Join if you get annoyed after being asked what you do, where you are from, and how long you have been in Wellington every single time you meet someone. If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll never have to speak in public if you don\u2019t want to!\n\nHOW TO JOIN?\nTake 2 minutes to fill out our form\n\nhttps://luma.com/ftstwellington7\nOur events are limited to 30 handpicked guests to ensure a cozy atmosphere.

We only reveal the location to ticket holders 24 hours before the event.\n\nWHAT THEY SAY\n\u201cGreat way to connect with people in a more meaningful way. Get to the heart of the matter, dive straight into what really counts!\u201d - Matthias\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of activity humanity needs every weekend. Thank you for all.\u201d - Sonya\n\n\u201cF*ck the Small Talk changes the narrative from \"Where are you from?\" to \"When was the last time you laughed uncontrollably?\" and I think that's beautiful.\u201d - Monika\n\n\u201cI loved F*ck the small talk, I was a little bit nervous at first but they are pros at making you feel comfortable with the rest of the group, the activities are really fun and I enjoyed every second (consider that the one who's saying this is very, very shy). Give it a try!\u201d - Brenda\n\n\"it\u2019s a wonderful experience, it\u2019s like being a kid again, when you were at the park, playing with other kids, and just decided you were going to be best friends for the next hours. Maybe you\u2019ll never see those kids again. But that hour was amazing because you both opened up and trusted each other.\" - Sara\n\n\u201cLively, interesting, introspective, completely open and no judgement.

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa. This annual public lecture series recognises the legacy of the late Dr Michael Volkerling who was one of the principal architects of New Zealand's cultural and creative sectors.",

His music bridges avant-garde and experimental music with various groove-oriented styles from the worlds of jazz, R&B, electronic music, and more.

    "description": "NZIFF: Mirrors No. 3, In the wake of a traumatic incident, a young woman forms a surrogate mother-daughter relationship with her rescuer. As emotional walls come down, doubts arise: is there more to the care offered than simple kindness?\n\nLaura and Betty seem to be poles apart. Laura, a young, city dwelling music student, lives in an apartment with her boyfriend; Betty has an adult son and lives alone in rural Germany. Their lives are thrown together after a car accident leaves Laura in the care of the older woman. Despite ostensible differences, each recognises a familiar melancholy in the other. As a tentative trust grows, the women find something unlocking within themselves, even as complicating factors emerge, in the form of Betty\u2019s opaque family situation.\n\nMaster dramatist Christian Petzold reunites with frequent acting collaborator Paula Beer (Transit, Undine, Afire) and regular DOP Hans Fromm, turning his pen and camera to a smaller scale domestic drama. Mirrors No. 3 (named for a Ravel piano piece played within) makes visual and thematic echoes back to Petzold\u2019s previous work: from extended bike rides down rural lanes (Barbara), to the centrality of a piano (Phoenix), as well as the thread of mysterious tension that underlies them all. The film revels in the messy, stimulating complexities of human relationships, exploring the way that sometimes even questionable motivations can affect positive outcomes. \u2014 Jacob Powell",

It brings the sewing community together to share stashes, stories and delight in our mutual love of textiles.\nFabric-a-brac is volunteer-run, and is a fundraiser for hospice - in Wellington this is Mary Potter Hospice. All profits from this event are donated to their work. We've raised $80,000 since our first event in 2009.\nSelling fabric\nIf you have a stash you'd like to sell, you can come and take a stall. You pay a stallholder fee (which goes to Hospice) but anything you make on the day is yours to keep. Stalls are allocated via a ballot, which will take place closer to the time. Go to our website to find the form. Closes mid August.\n\nIf you have fabric, haberdashery or patterns you'd like to move on, but don't want to have a table, you can donate items. This will all go onto the hospice table on the day, and all profits will go to their wonderful work.\nFabric donation points\n- Made Marion\n- Mary Potter Hospice - you can take donations to the Mary Potter Hospice in Mein St, Newtown\n\nPop-up cafe\nThe fabulous cafe is back with all of its gorgeous volunteers and fab food. There will be tea, coffee and sweet treats for sale, so you can sit down and chat over your new projects and fabric purchases. All proceeds from the cafe also go to Hospice.\nBuying fabric\nBring cash - most stallholders and the cafe will be selling by cash only.\nWe look forward to seeing our fabulous fabric and sewing community soon!\n*Saturday September 20 2025\n*St Anne's Parish Hall, Emmett Street, Newtown, Wellington",

As you settle into the experience, allow the soothing tones to wash over you, releasing tension and promoting a sense of inner peace.\nScientific studies have highlighted the benefits of sound therapy, particularly gong baths, in reducing stress and promoting overall well-being. The rhythmic patterns and frequencies of the gongs can help entrain brainwaves, leading to a meditative state and improved mental clarity.\nBeyond the immediate effects, many participants report experiencing lasting benefits such as improved sleep, reduced anxiety, and enhanced mood following a gong bath session. By immersing yourself in the healing vibrations of the gongs, you can tap into a deeper sense of relaxation and rejuvenation.\nWhether you're looking to unwind after a long day or explore new avenues of self-care, this 1-hour gong bath offers a unique opportunity to reconnect with yourself and find balance amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life. There will be cups of tea available afterwards to help us integrate and ground\n**THIS EVENT IS RESTRICTED TO 20 PEOPLE ONLY**\nDisclaimer\nGong baths are safe and supportive for most people. However, please consult your doctor or mental health professional before attending if you:\n-have a pacemaker or other implanted medical device\n-live with epilepsy or a sound-sensitive condition\n-are in the first trimester of pregnancy\n-are experiencing severe or unmanaged mental health challenges (such as psychosis, schizophrenia, or PTSD)\nIf you have recent injuries, surgeries, or other health concerns, let me know so we can make sure you\u2019re comfortable.\nEveryone responds differently to sound. If at any point during the session you feel overwhelmed or uncomfortable, you are welcome to sit up, move gently, or step outside. Your wellbeing always comes first.\nAbout Me\nErika is a musician and astrologer based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. She has 30+ years musical experience. Erika has an interest in the healing properties of sound for mental and physical wellbeing, which she currently explores through her gong bathing practice",

Through a blend of philosophical reflection and grounded tools, we\u2019ll explore how to steady the mind and reconnect with deeper purpose in the face of pressure or doubt.\n\n\nMeet your host, Sivananda\nSivananda\u2019s background is in both science and music, holding a Master's Degree in Data Science, a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a long history of playing and performing on the double bass. His passion for philosophy, music, good food and community attracted him to the bhakti lifestyle. Having studied and practiced the science of the \u2018self\u2019 for six years now, he thrives on drawing insights from contemporary science and combining it with yoga wisdom to encourage others to explore new perspectives.\n6.15pm Tuesday 19th August\nEnd the session on a high note with a delicious plant-based dinner, dessert, and good conversation.\nTickets available here~ bit.ly/eventTickets\nBhakti Lounge 1/175 Vivian Street, Te Aro, Wellington. http://www.bhaktilounge.org.nz ",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\n\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.\n\n",

Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".\n\n1 Day\nPresented by Paul and Mary-Ellen Gadd.",

Once you register, you'll receive an acknowledgement from Humanitix, followed by a second email directly from the Holocaust Centre of New Zealand.\n2025 Annual Kristallnacht Commemorative Concert\nEscape & Exile \u2013 East & West\nJoin the Holocaust Centre of New Zealand for a poignant evening of remembrance and reflection. The Te K\u014dk\u012b Trio, featuring Inbal Megiddo (cello), Martin Riseley (violin), and Jian Liu (piano), will be joined by Professor Kim Cunio, Head of Te K\u014dk\u012b / New Zealand School of Music, in a powerful performance commemorating Kristallnacht.\n This concert commemorates Kristallnacht, or \u201cThe Night of Broken Glass,\u201d the horrific pogroms of 9\u201310 November 1938, across Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland. This state-sponsored violence saw the murder of an estimated 91 Jews, the arrest of 30,000, and the destruction of hundreds of synagogues and Jewish businesses. Kristallnacht is widely regarded as a pivotal moment, marking the escalation of Nazi persecution and often described as the beginning of the Holocaust.\n The Nazis sought to silence the music and art of all those they deemed \"untermenschen,\" including six million Jews and other victimised groups. This concert stands as a powerful act of defiance and remembrance, allowing us to hear the voices of those who were murdered, forced into hiding, or exiled. It celebrates their artistic brilliance and ensures their memory lives on.\n This year's theme is \"Escape and Exile: East and West.\" In the tradition of paying musical tribute to all victims, we will honour the music of Jewish composers from across the globe\u2014from the Netherlands and Nazi-occupied Germany in the West, all the way to Iraq and Shanghai in the East.\n The programme will feature pieces that honour:\nErna Weiss Falk, a talented Jewish opera singer from Cologne, whose promising career was cut short by anti-Jewish laws. She and her family ultimately escaped to the Netherlands.\nBrigitte Schiffer, a young composer who completed her doctorate in Berlin before fleeing the Nazis to Egypt, where she became the director of the Higher Music Education Institute for women.\nThe Al Kuwaiti brothers, Jewish pioneers of modern Iraqi music, survived the Farhud, a devastating pogrom inspired by Nazi ideology that targeted Baghdad's Jewish population on June 1-2, 1941, coinciding with the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. Despite their legacy resonating across the Middle East through radio, their contributions were erased from Iraqi history.\nFerdinand Adler, a Hungarian Jewish violinist who miraculously escaped from the Dachau concentration camp, to Shanghai.\n Join us for this important event as we mourn the lives lost and celebrate the resilience of the human spirit. We look forward to welcoming you.\n Details:\nWellington: Sunday, 9 November 2025\nAuckland: Monday, 10 November 2025\nDoors Open: 6:00 PM\nConcert Begins: 6:45 PM\nLocation: To Be Announced\n Please RSVP by Monday, 3 November 2025, to let us know if you can join us.",

    "description": "Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour, Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour\nIndie-Folk Artist Colette Rivers and her band will be performing her intimate new album, The Backyard Wonder.\n\nIndependent artist Colette Rivers is releasing her second full-length album, The Backyard Wonder, an intimate exploration of healing, change, and the quiet beauty of ordinary moments.\n\nThis album holds special meaning for Rivers: after being diagnosed with cancer in July 2023, her planned sophomore release had to take a back seat to recovery. But when the cancer returned in early 2025, she felt compelled to finish and release the album, not just as a legacy project, also as a celebration after hard times, with a focus on how \u201cyou can find the wonder in life, even in your backyard.\u201d\n\nA lifelong creative, Rivers records, mixes, and produces in her home studio in Masterton, and plays every instrument heard on The Backyard Wonder. Her debut album, Memory Lake (2020), was shaped by early years spent in the US, and her move to Taup\u014d at age 11; this was followed by a nationwide tour. Now based in the Wairarapa and working as a secondary school drama teacher, Rivers continues to move between solo performance and full band sets, while staying rooted in the acoustic traditions that define her sound.\n\nWith her right arm partially paralysed following recent treatment, Rivers has gathered a group of close friends to help bring the songs of The Backyard Wonder to life (especially its intricate fingerpicking parts) for a run of live shows. She\u2019ll be touring the Wellington and Wairarapa regions from August through October, finishing with a set at the Wellington Folk Festival.\n\nFor updates, and behind-the-scenes glimpses, visit www.coletteriversmusic.com or follow @colettemusic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nOpening for Rivers are artists:\n\nPhil Masters\nPhil Lively-Masters is an experienced, well travelled singer songwriter who specialises in writing the sort of Sun Kissed West Coast Laurel Canyon Americana that made Neil Young, Stephen Stills and the Byrds famous. With a powerful, honey soaked voice that has won praise and support slots from legendary American country rock pioneers like The Jayhawks and original cosmic cowboy Steve Young, Phil has 20 years worth of road worn original songs to pull on, including tracks from the critically acclaimed CANYON RYDE album 'Free To Be' and some choice country rock covers to weave a spell on any listener.\n\nSaali Marks\nA singer, songwriter, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, Saali Marks hails originally from the\nSouth Island, but has made Wairarapa his home for the last 20 years, where he lives on a farm\nwith his family and teaches music at Kuranui College.\nSaali has played in numerous bands over the years, in a wide range of styles from proto-punk\nto psychedelic dub, covers, originals and fully improvised music with no discernible genre, on\nstages throughout Aotearoa since 1991. Currently he fronts the Wellington ska band Battleska\nGalactica.\nThroughout and alongside it all Saali has indulged his love for songwriting and solo\nperforming, developing a unique style, rooted in folk and blues, and inspired by greats from\nacross the decades. A skilled guitarist, Saali rarely plays straight ahead chords, and an\neducation in jazz has informed his ear for harmony, the beauty of dissonance, tension and\nresolution, with unconventional song structures, alternate tunings and intriguing melodies.\nAlthough not adverse to penning the odd love song, most of Saali\u2019s lyrics tend to focus on\nother aspects of the human condition, from religion and politics to our relationships with the\nenvironment and our own minds.\n\n",

By integrating creative writing into your painting practice, you can enhance your imagination, storytelling abilities, emotional expression, attention to detail, and personal style on the canvas. Please bring along a journal or laptop.\n\nCOURSE CONTENT\nEach session presents a key idea backed by research or concrete examples, followed by practical writing exercises with optional sharing. We learn by doing and from each other.\n\n1. Generating work from the interior: tapping into memories, conflict, emotion, and observation to generate art.\n2. Figuring out what matters to you, then learning how to grow your fragmented ideas into something whole. For example, how do you turn a feeling, or a fleeting moment in time into a story? Into a painting? Into a work of art? What are the building blocks you need?\n3. Inspiration from other creative sources: people, music, poetry, reading, random incidents. Ways to generate fresh ideas. How to clarify and focus in writing and art.\n4. Structure and boundaries. Dreaming big but being real. How do you find and stick to a creative process? Understanding how you learn and what kind of feedback you need. Designing your next project.\n\nThursday mornings, 9:30 - 11:45 am.\n4 - 25 September.",

    "description": "Book Club: Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",

Gaining international attention after opening for one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most coveted DJs Fred again.. and remixing his song \u2018places to be\u2019, which now has over 2.6M listens on Spotify alone, MESSIE is quickly becoming one of the most exciting new names to watch in New Zealand.\n\nAudiences will be able to enjoy MESSIE\u2019s high-energy, electrifying All Night Long sets in Auckland and Wellington until the early hours of the morning. Saturday, 13 September, will see her take over Auckland\u2019s Studio the Venue, before heading to Wellington\u2019s San Fran the following Saturday, for a sold-out show on 20 September. She\u2019ll return for a second San Fran show on Friday, 26 September, before continuing the TEETH TOUR at Gisborne\u2019s Smash Palace on Friday, 7 November, and Christchurch\u2019s Hide Club on Saturday, 8 November.\n\nMESSIE is taking Aotearoa\u2019s electronic dance music scene to filthy new levels. As a former drummer, her passion for drumming was the pipeline for her falling in love with genres like Garage, Breakbeat, and Jungle. She has since expanded her sound and it\u2019s safe to say each set will keep you guessing what will come next as she effortlessly merges genres such as Baile Funk, Ghetto Tech, Jersey Club, Juke, Afro beat inspired drums, Techno and many more global club soundscapes that encompass her high energy DJ sets. MESSIE\u2019s sets are guaranteed to be bootleg heavy with something for everyone as she draws from her own music taste of rap and grime, to early 2000\u2019s singalongs, girl-boss anthems and queer music culture in the form of edits you\u2019d never expect.\n\nAlongside her headline tour around Aotearoa in mid 2024, MESSIE has now brought her fresh, high-energy club music internationally to Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, R&V, Beyond The Valley, Wildlands, Love Saves The Day, Gemfest & Outro Festival. With slots at Pohoda Festival, Hidden Festival, Motion, Truck Festival, AIASOUND and All Points East already this year, there is no slowing her down.",

This performance is an alliance between:\nNiels Gedge, fingerstyle guitar and lead vocals, a well-known singer-songwriter on the folk scene, with two albums of original songs. He has also performed extensively in cafes and bars and at events in the UK and throughout NZ. Niels' vocal range is very similar to Leonard Cohen.\nKate Marshall, multi-instrumentalist and vocals.

Bob has opened for Americana Greats: Guy Clark, Townes van Zandt, Tom Russell, and Jimmy LaFave.\nSteve Trotman, vocals and acoustic guitar. Inspired by the bands of the 1950s and 1960s and singer/songwriters, such as James Taylor and Paul Simon, Steve fronted various Wellington groups in the 1970s. He co-founded Verandah Band in the early 2000s, playing a mix of genres in every Wairarapa venue (and beyond) for the past 20-odd years, including Toast Martinborough and Summer Hummer.\nThe Offering is fully licenced and will be serving snacks and drinks from 6.30pm",

    "description": "Nui Hui 7, Nui Hui 7\nNUI HUI 7 \u2013 LIVE AT 14 WAIU STREET\nWainuiomata, Lower Hutt\nSaturday 22 November 2025 | 4PM \u2013 LATE\n\nNui Hui is back \u2013 louder, prouder, and more unfiltered than ever. This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\n",

    "description": "Romi Wrights And Leao, This October, two of Aotearoa\u2019s brightest talents come together for a one-night-only double headline show in Te Whanganui-a-Tara.\nOn Saturday, October 18th, 60s soul, funk, and R&B revivalists Romi Wrights & the Commotions join forces with fellow \"niu-wave\" sonic explorers LEAO for their debut headline performances in the capital.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this celebration of era-blending, electrifying Pacific journeys through sound.\n\n\nLEAO\n\nFormed from a Pacific heart, LEAO is a Samoan musical project led by guitarist/vocalist David Feauai-Afaese, joined by bassist Navakatoa Tekela-Pule, Hawaiian-steel guitarist Levi Gemmell, and drummer Larsen Tito-Taylor. With a deep adoration for Pacific musical reference points and a desire to explore new sonic ground, LEAO synthesises non-traditional tonalities with a fa\u2018asamoa spirit, creating what some have called \u201cniu wave\u201d and \u201cPacific neo-psychedelia.\u201d A creative enigma and phenomenal live act since the release of their critically acclaimed debut GHOST ROADS in 2019, LEAO has continued to expand its vision with the 2024 single TAEAO / MEA UMA - a sparkling glimpse into a significant body of alternative Pacific music currently in development. The group is now actively working towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\n\nRomi Wrights\n\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring stories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke festival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release mid to late 2025.",

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nMercy Lie:\n\nDriving all night under the stars, along the highways of human experience, the original songs of Mercy Lie will haunt, surprise, remind and affirm.\n\nMercy Lie is the musical guise of Laura Chester-Murphy. An instinctive sound maker from an early age, Laura just wants to keep the music rolling. There\u2019s a lot of sound from that little acoustic guitar and a voice to match. In the songs, you will find fierce independence, crushing vulnerability and a reflective wit that speaks to a life of figuring stuff out along the way.\n\nWith influences ranging across and not limited to folk, funk, country, goth, indie and 90\u2019s rave, Laura puts the focus on crafting percussive earworms that won\u2019t leave your head easily. The music of Mercy Lie is a unique soundscape, sculpted with ambience and depth, the silence unforgettably painted by explorations into the motivations of both the self and fellow travellers.\n\nMercy Lie is about connecting over the foibles of polite society and the ways we are wired to weave around each other.\n\nHometowns, journeys, mysteries, ghosts, growing up, messing up, speaking out, moving on. If you like getting nostalgic over something and nothing all at once, buckle up.\n\n\u201cMercy Lie\u2019s novel approach to the guitar and talent for songwriting make for the perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that voice to come from that mouth.\u201d\n\u201cAn acoustic delight!\u201d\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience. As she continues to evolve as an artist, Araiyah\u2019s music promises to touch the hearts of many, leaving a lasting impact on all who have the privilege of listening.\n\nAraiyah will be accompanied by guitarist Izzy and Laura Chester-Murphy on percussion.\n\nRain and the Urban Bohemians:\n\nFormed around the music of singer-songwriter Cathy Elizabeth aka Rain, supported by her band of Urban Bohemians, this group has been able to weave together many different influences and styles to create something quite unique and beautiful.\n\nPeppered with contemplations of our existence and the fleetingness of time, Rain & the UBs bring the magic with a folk-rock edge and an alluring authenticity at its centre. Spiritual undertones and overtones give way to an uplifting joyfulness, of triumph over difficulties and life lessons learned and expressed through music.\n\nWith Cathy Elizabeth on vocals & acoustic guitar, Chris Ewers on bass, Murray James on drums and Izzy and Dion on guitars, these guys have got the goods and are ready to deliver!\n\nSo come along and allow yourself to be immersed and transported, moved and entertained. It\u2019s going to be a very special night all round!\n\n",

    "description": "Songwriters' Saturday, These Wellington singer-songwriters have put together an evening of original music for your enjoyment.\n\nOpening the evening is Rachel Hird on piano, with vocalist Brenda Shearer. Next up is local producer, musician and songwriter Phil Riley, followed by a good 50 mins of toe-tapping grooving with The Grey Dog Band.\n\nMore about the artists:\n\nRachel Hird is a Wellington based singer-songwriter. She grew up playing the piano and studying classical music. Nowadays she writes and performs her own songs, best described as \u2018songs from the heart'. She is constantly inspired by people she meets in the world of music such as musician, vocalist, songwriter and mentor Brenda Shearer, and sing-songwriter Charlotte Yates whose songwriting school is a place where many songs have been crafted. Rachel's songs are inspired by people, places and events of the past and present. She is planning an EP release early 2026.\n\nPhil Riley is a full-time writer /producer with a recording studio in Korokoro. He's a wordsmith and melodic songwriter with influences from the Beatles and Paul Simon to Coldplay. Phil started on the English Club circuit as a guitarist, then drummer and keyboard player/singer in NZ bands.\nRiley got to know Grammy winner Jon Mark of White Cloud Records (Naxos), and this led to a series of 6 Celtic and World music albums for the label, including The Blessing Tree, which reached #11 on the US radio play charts and was nominated for 5 NZ Tui music awards.\n\nRiley has tracks on European and US albums alongside artists such as Enya, Sarah McLachlan, Sinead O\u2019Connor, Secret Garden and Clannad. The compilation \u2018Celtic Journey\u2019 reached #1 on the American Billboard charts.\n\nOver the past few years, the art and craft of songwriting has become a priority, driving his recording and performing focus and moving his musical centre of gravity. His first \u2019new\u2019 indie album \u2018Five Dollar Rockets\u2019 featured a stellar cast of instrumentalists and singers.\nIn this unplugged \u2018sneak preview\u2019 of songs from the first and upcoming second album he\u2019ll be joined by long-time talented music buddies Charlie Harter and Marty Parlane on guitars and the wonderful Brenda Shearer on vocals.\n\nThe Grey Dog are a deluded bunch of cork-sniffers who think they will improve with age. They are John Broadbent \u2013 vocals, guitar and harp, Martyn Parlane \u2013 vocals and guitar, Graeme \u201cGrey Dog\u201d Sullivan \u2013 bass and vocals and Greg Bates - drums. They often play around Courtenay Place, where they use their music to lure passing sailors to their doom. Their musical style is wide-ranging, but basically Boomer. They hope their music will provide some fuel for your hearts, heads, and toes.\n\nThe Realm is a family friendly venue with a great vibe, good food, including children's menu and a good range of refreshing beverages available at the bar.

    "description": "Renaissance Gold - in celebration with Manawat\u016b Sinfonia featuring Bach's Magnificat, Renaissance Gold - in celebration with Manawat\u016b Sinfonia featuring Bach's Magnificat\nOn Saturday 13 September, at 7.00 pm in the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit on Broadway, PN, the choir under Christine Archer-Lockwood is to be joined by the Manawatu Sinfonia and soloists, Caroline Hickman, Jennifer Little and Lindsay Yeo with choristers Nigel Tongs and Bront\u00e9 Hodgetts also singing solo in Bach's Magnificat. The Magnificat is a world favourite, arguably Bach's best choral piece that has transcended the ages, celebrating Luke's description of Mary's pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, the choir and orchestra perform Ritchie's Then I Understood. When a child of seven to nine, Laura Rangers sketched eight poems centred on summers at Otaki Beach, Ritchie seized the opportunity to add the musical dimension and the result are dual choirs - the Renaissance Singers split - accompanied by the Sinfonia to set off Rangers' delightful insights, so elegantly displayed. The magic that can be childhood.\n\nThe concert has a celebratory theme, it being the 50th anniversary of the choir. Thus the inclusion of Forrest's Three Nocturnes that express the wonderment involved when examining the heavens and the universe full of stars. Throughout this piece the percussionists alone from the Sinfonia provide whimsical accompaniment with a celeste providing the heavenly tones - a hit when played on the last occasion the choir sang the piece.\n\nOpening the concert will be Carl Orff's O Fortuna from his popular Carmina Burana. While O Fortuna laments the role of fate it is set in the larger piece that celebrates life with gusto.\n\nWith the performers in great form (two choristers just back from singing with the world's best choir) this concert will no doubt build the sense of celebration - full of life and wonderment.\n\nGeneral Admission $25, Concession $20, Secondary School $15,\nUnder 13 Free.\n\n",

Ephemeral, described as \u201cquite spiritually intense music\u201d by The Guardian, explores the transience of human relationships with one another and the natural world through alternatively floating and driving improvisatory impulses of Wilson and his ensemble.\n\nThe quintet for this performance will present the music of Free, Free and Ephemeral in a brand-new configuration: Wilson on saxophone and bass clarinet, Mana Waiariki on violin, Seth Boy on bass, Callum Allardice on guitar, and Abe Baillie on drums.\n\nDave Wilson is a saxophonist, clarinettist, composer, producer, and interdisciplinary scholar. His music bridges avant-garde and experimental music with various groove-oriented styles from the worlds of jazz, R&B, electronic music, and more. Before relocating to Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington in 2016, Dave grew up in the Chicago area, lived for a decade in Los Angeles, and spent several stints living in Skopje, North Macedonia.\n\nPart of the Wellington Jazz Festival 2025",

    "description": "Romi Wrights And Leao, This October, two of Aotearoa\u2019s brightest talents come together for a one-night-only double headline show in Te Whanganui-a-Tara.\nOn Saturday, October 18th, 60s soul, funk, and R&B revivalists Romi Wrights & the Commotions join forces with fellow \"niu-wave\" sonic explorers LEAO for their debut headline performances in the capital.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this celebration of era-blending, electrifying Pacific journeys through sound.\n\n\nLEAO\n\nFormed from a Pacific heart, LEAO is a Samoan musical project led by guitarist/vocalist David Feauai-Afaese, joined by bassist Navakatoa Tekela-Pule, Hawaiian-steel guitarist Levi Gemmell, and drummer Larsen Tito-Taylor. With a deep adoration for Pacific musical reference points and a desire to explore new sonic ground, LEAO synthesises non-traditional tonalities with a fa\u2018asamoa spirit, creating what some have called \u201cniu wave\u201d and \u201cPacific neo-psychedelia.\u201d A creative enigma and phenomenal live act since the release of their critically acclaimed debut GHOST ROADS in 2019, LEAO has continued to expand its vision with the 2024 single TAEAO / MEA UMA - a sparkling glimpse into a significant body of alternative Pacific music currently in development. The group is now actively working towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\n\nRomi Wrights\n\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring stories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke festival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release mid to late 2025.",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more.

This hands-on interaction brings a sense of movement and authenticity that\u2019s hard to achieve otherwise.\n\nThe sculpting process typically starts by analyzing the model\u2019s proportions and pose. A wire armature is built to support the structure and clay is gradually applied to develop the form to a one-third life size 750mm tall figure. From there the artist refines the shapes focusing on anatomical accuracy and expressive detail that give the sculpture its final character.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in traditional sculpture and the film industry Javier is not just a sculptor \u2014 he\u2019s a mentor. Trained in classical techniques he studied fine arts and took anatomy courses at medical school developing a rare combination of artistic and anatomical knowledge. He spent over five years at the world-renowned Weta Workshop contributing to major films and exhibitions and has worked across materials scales and digital technologies.\n\nMaterial is included in the price.\nArmature is supplied during the workshop.\nYou can buy our tools during the workshop if you like.\nTea\n\n",

The Aeronaut is currently still a work in progress; this evening offers keen punters a chance to watch Vorn and his frighteningly good band (Nick Brown - Drums; Charley Davenport - Bass, Thomas Liggett - Violin) iron out the final kinks on a future Kiwi classic. Be there so you can say you were!\n\nhttps://vornpowertool.bandcamp.com/\n\n\n$17.50 presales available via UTR\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

    "description": "Wendyhouse / DSLB / vegetable.machine.animal, Wendyhouse / DSLB / vegetable.machine.animal\nWendyhouse are Bryce Galloway and Daniel Powell (AKA Mr Pudding and EE monk). The pair met at the Elam School of Fine Arts. Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995. Wendyhouse output has been somewhat sporadic ever since, but with EE monk\u2019s recent return, the pair have returned to performing live.\n\nWendyhouse music was initially played on toy musical instruments, the kind that fit inside a Wendy house. Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\n\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo. Guitar, toy keyboard and vocals are the Wendyhouse instruments of choice.\n\n---\n\n\nDSLB\n\nDSLB is the solo project of Chrissie Butler (the shouty bass playing half of the now sleeping duo, mr sterile Assembly). An offshoot from Chrissie's other band Ditzy Squall, DSLB (Ditzy Squall's Lunch Box) is a showcase for a love of long endings and the hum things make when you hold them close to your ear. Performed live, DSLB is an improvised mash-up of ancient record players, purring keyboards, kitchen utensils and found objects. Soundtracks for short films and hand drawn comics are also residents in the lunch box. Recordings are released by skirted Records.\n\nhttps://skirtedrecords.com/dslb/\n\n---\n\nvegetable.machine.animal\n\nNew solo project courtesy of Mr Sterile, in which living fungal and plantlife inform a modular synthesiser with biofeedback. This signal acts upon the synth changing the pitch, tone, rate and more in the delivery of sound. These \u2018curated\u2019 sounds are then responded to with percussion. VMA explores the intersections between spontaneous playing, electronic music, and science-informed inter-species collaboration.\n\nhttps://mrsterileassembly.bandcamp.com/album/my-daughter-the-spider\n\n\n$17.50 presales available via UTR\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

His journey led him to Montreal, where he explored jazz, world music, and spiritual sound traditions.\n\nExtensive travels in Asia and Europe deepened his connection with Indian music and yogic philosophy. He studied Tibetan singing bowls in Kathmandu and Varanasi, and has since worked with a wide range of instruments including the sitar, esraj, bansuri, harmonium, flutes, gongs, and voice.\n\nClaudio\u2019s work blends technical skill, deep presence, and a profound respect for the healing power of sound.\n\nLearn more or listen to Claudio\u2019s music here:\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/claudioescutiasounds\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/claudio_yoga_sound_healing\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/soundhealingyogamusicclaudio\n\n\n",

When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought.

    "description": "Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2, Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2\nThe Second coming of the \"Crush the Vernon\" Vert Day is just around the corner, We had such a great time last time and its smack bang into the point where everyone needs elevation for events so i thought it would be silly not to bring it back!\n\n\"Crush the Vernon\" is a couple of fun endurance challeges to get us up into the Wither Hills for a big vert day!\nThis event will push you to the red line, boasting both as much high-level uphill suffering as you can possibly endure whilst building a steady accumulation of regret over 6 hours on the trails.\nIt\u2019s an event that's built to stretch the boundaries of what you think you can do uphill, but overall, it\u2019s a chance to get out there and have some fun, whether solo or in a team. Whilst there is some faster efforts needed to come out on top of any of these \u201cdisciplines\u201d, the aim of the game is just to get out there and enjoy yourself at whatever pace suits you.\n\nThe added extra this time is not only an extra hour, explained below, but the plan is to tie this into the elevation for a group effort for a BTR Everest Challenge, more details around this when I can get a team entry together, but really keen to try and pudh the limits of what has been done before.\n\nDetails:\nDate: 26th October - Backup date is the week after\nTime: 6am-1pm - (1 hr per week it too Hialry to conquer everest!)\nLocation: The Wither Hills, Basecamp: Sutherland Stream picnic area - this will be where we have the whiteboard & a bit of an \"Aid station/Bag drop\" situation going on.\n\nDisciplines:\n- \"Vernon Vert Masters\" Highest total elevation (solo/team) - pretty self explanatory, but between the hours of 6 am- 1pm any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day (solo or in a team) counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n\n- \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop (solo/team) - Crush the covenant Loop is a 3.75km, 300m vert loop running from Sutherland Stream Picnic Area to the Mt Vernon Summit & then back down again, the loops can be run in whichever direction you would like, just be aware that this is a 2-way track and there will be a bit more traffic than you would usually see up on it. The aim of the game here is to get as many laps in as possible between 6 am-1pm; this will also count toward your elevation total for the \"Vernon Vert Masters\"\n\nThe Basics:\n- This is an open event to anyone who wants to participate\n- The event is open from 6am-1pm - any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n- We will have a basecamp/aid station at the Sutherland stream picnic spot. This will be the hub for the meet-up and the start/finish line for the laps of \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d.\n- No minimum time, you can start whenever you like in the 6 am-1pm timeframe and go for as long as you would like.\n-You can do as many laps/summits/cumulative elevation as you like/can within the timeframe.\n- Teams - Teams can be between 2-5 people for the overall elevation challenge, and your total elevation will be your total accumulated. You will need to pre-register your team with Mikey before the day so that we can have you on the scoreboard.\n- You will need to confirm your solo/teams total elevation with Basecamp by 1.30pm on the day, in person. If you are unable to do this for whatever reason, you will need to confirm and prove details via message or screenshots so we can add them to the total tally.\n\n\nWho's up for some hills?\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nWe at Blenheim Trail Runners don\u2019t see ourselves as event organisers and as such, do not have any consent or insurance; we deem this as a \u201cClub Meet-up\u201d.\nWith that, the expectation is that you are 100% responsible for yourself and take part at your own risk.\nBe aware, as this isn't a formal event, there won't be any official timekeeping, marshals or trail markers. There will be DIY DIY-type whiteboard to note down your shared laps & elevation, and we will provide details via trail maps for the \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop.\nWe are unable to provide any/can not be held responsible for: Urgent medical attention (we will however, assist wherever possible, there will be a first aid kit at base camp), nutrition, hydration ( there is public access throughout the hills and in two points on the \u201ccrush the Covenant\u201d loop), the condition of the trail on the day or the weather.\n\n",

You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week.

No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\n\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz.\n\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing. It is not intended as therapy nor does it replace counselling, therapy, or any other medical or clinical professional help. Participants are guided to draw out where they are at, whilst drawing out their own inner resources for support and guidance.\nParticipants understand it is their own responsibility to manage their mental and physical health during sessions, to opt in and out of activities as they see fit, and make the facilitator aware if further support is required.",

    "description": "Opening - Slipping through your fingers, grasping, Meanwhile invites you to the opening of \u2018Slipping through your fingers, grasping\u2019 by Justine Fletcher, Christine Brimer andRita Takeuchi\n_____\nThe text Sounding the Event, by artist and writer Yve Lomax, raises the question \u201cWhat does it mean to grasp something by letting it slip through your fingers?\u201d\nSlipping Through Your Fingers, Grasping explores the paradoxical ways in which everyday experiences can be apprehended\u2014through their fluid, malleable qualities rather than rigid, unyielding structures. The installation brings together the practices of Justine Fletcher, Christine Brimer, and Rita Takeuchi to draw attention to the fleeting essence of daily life, the interplay of absence and presence, and the ever-changing nature of time and memory.\nExperience is always slipping away; time, memory, or an event can only be grasped in their passing, in their trace, or in their absence. Short, intermittent chimes highlight this ephemerality, making duration palpable through moments of presence and absence. Paintings emerge from an attunement to everyday encounters and their emotional resonance, while sculptural and woven forms unravel and shift, emphasising process not as a means to an end, but as a state of becoming. Together, the works suggest that sometimes the only way to \u201chold\u201d something, whether a moment, time, or an atmosphere, is by revealing its impermanence.\n",

By immersing yourself in the healing vibrations of the gongs, you can tap into a deeper sense of relaxation and rejuvenation.\n\nWhether you're looking to unwind after a long day or explore new avenues of self-care, this 1-hour gong bath offers a unique opportunity to reconnect with yourself and find balance amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life.

    "description": "Songwriters' Saturday, These Wellington singer-songwriters have put together an evening of original music for your enjoyment.\n\nOpening the evening is Rachel Hird on piano, with vocalist Brenda Shearer. Next up is local producer, musician and songwriter Phil Riley, followed by a good 50 mins of toe-tapping grooving with The Grey Dog Band.\n\nMore about the artists:\n\nRachel Hird is a Wellington based singer-songwriter. She grew up playing the piano and studying classical music. Nowadays she writes and performs her own songs, best described as \u2018songs from the heart'. She is constantly inspired by people she meets in the world of music such as musician, vocalist, songwriter and mentor Brenda Shearer, and sing-songwriter Charlotte Yates whose songwriting school is a place where many songs have been crafted. Rachel's songs are inspired by people, places and events of the past and present. She is planning an EP release early 2026.\n\nPhil Riley is a full-time writer /producer with a recording studio in Korokoro. He's a wordsmith and melodic songwriter with influences from the Beatles and Paul Simon to Coldplay. Phil started on the English Club circuit as a guitarist, then drummer and keyboard player/singer in NZ bands.\nRiley got to know Grammy winner Jon Mark of White Cloud Records (Naxos), and this led to a series of 6 Celtic and World music albums for the label, including The Blessing Tree, which reached #11 on the US radio play charts and was nominated for 5 NZ Tui music awards.\n\nRiley has tracks on European and US albums alongside artists such as Enya, Sarah McLachlan, Sinead O\u2019Connor, Secret Garden and Clannad. The compilation \u2018Celtic Journey\u2019 reached #1 on the American Billboard charts.\n\nOver the past few years, the art and craft of songwriting has become a priority, driving his recording and performing focus and moving his musical centre of gravity. His first \u2019new\u2019 indie album \u2018Five Dollar Rockets\u2019 featured a stellar cast of instrumentalists and singers.\nIn this unplugged \u2018sneak preview\u2019 of songs from the first and upcoming second album he\u2019ll be joined by long-time talented music buddies Charlie Harter and Marty Parlane on guitars and the wonderful Brenda Shearer on vocals.\n\nThe Grey Dog are a deluded bunch of cork-sniffers who think they will improve with age. They are John Broadbent \u2013 vocals, guitar and harp, Martyn Parlane \u2013 vocals and guitar, Graeme \u201cGrey Dog\u201d Sullivan \u2013 bass and vocals and Greg Bates - drums. They often play around Courtenay Place, where they use their music to lure passing sailors to their doom. Their musical style is wide-ranging, but basically Boomer. They hope their music will provide some fuel for your hearts, heads, and toes.\n\nThe Realm is a family friendly venue with a great vibe, good food, including children's menu and a good range of refreshing beverages available at the bar.

BUT WHO ARE THE DECEMBERISTS?\nHailing from Portland Oregon, The Decemberists is an indie-alt folk rock band that write epic songs and have 9 studio albums to their credit. They are renowned for their musical style and unique storytelling with many song lyrics based on historical incidents and folklore. Perhaps drawing musical influence from the likes of The Beatles, Tom Waits, REM, Morrisey, their songs are exquisitely constructed and effortlessly combine folk-rock with elements of pop creating the infectious sound that is The Decemberists.\nAnd who is BANDIT QUEEN? Experienced Christchurch based musos - Tim Kent (vocals, acoustic guitar); Justin 'Rusty' White (lead guitar); Jo-Anne Davern Fuller (vocals, keyboard); Chiara Lowe (violin, vocals); Adam Lowe (bass); Mark Newburn (drums, percussion).\nThe members of BANDIT QUEEN are passionate about this project and invite you to come experience and enjoy the eclectic music of USA indie-rock band THE DECEMBERISTS.",

Each mailer included a handwritten note from the Reach Records founder, and a QR code linking to The Workshop \u2013 an online community where fans can access early music, content, and engage to earn points for incentives.\n\nContinuing his mission of bringing Christ to the culture, he now gears up to make international headlines with his renewed stage presence, ultimately setting the tone for an unstoppable and intentional run. The announcement also heralds the arrival of Lecrae\u2019s forthcoming album Reconstruction \u2013 his first solo project since 2022\u2019s Church Clothes 4 LP.\n\n",

You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

    "description": "NZIFF: Romeria, One of the standouts of Cannes 2025, Carla Sim\u00f3n\u2019s personal exploration of the restlessness of a young woman without parents is a poignant example of the healing power of cinema.\n\nAfter winning the Best Film in Berlin with Alcarr\u00e0s (2022), Spanish director Carla Sim\u00f3n looks back into her own memories and heals pains from the past with her spellbinding third feature film Romer\u00eda.\n\nEighteen-year-old Marina is an aspiring film student who sets out to trace the fate of her biological parents \u2013 who both died during the HIV epidemic of the late 1980s, early 1990s. Raised in Barcelona by her maternal grandparents, Marina visits her paternal family in Galicia, in order to obtain the paternity recognition documents that would allow her to apply for a scholarship. Guided on her journey by the pages of her mother's diary, Marina revisits her parents\u2019 story of love and addiction...\n\nSim\u00f3n brushes with delicate touches the dynamics of a difficult family reconciliation and the motions of post-adolescent desire (the attraction between Marina and her cousin). While she initially draws from the tropes of summertime family dramas, Sim\u00f3n then turns Romer\u00eda into a dreamlike fable where the past comes alive through the present thanks to the simple, yet enchanting true magic of cinema.\u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.\nAs Glinda\u2019s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba\u2019s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives.\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor. This is despite his daughter being one of the pupils benefiting most from the free expression encouraged by Antonio\u2019s Freinet method teachings. Meanwhile, Ariadna teeters between hope and despair in her search for closure \u2013 a human vessel embodying the plight of a nation still wrestling with the consequences of a brutal conflict.\n\nThe closing credits remark that the remains of 12,000 people have been exhumed across the country. Like Ariadna, the film attempts to seek answers from the horrors of a war that took place almost a century ago \u2013 one driven by political sentiments that feel unsettlingly familiar as some of today\u2019s most powerful nations shift towards fascism. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

Evening are from the dinner break until the end of the last film.\n\nSurprise we are running a 35mm Mystery Marathon very soon! We have had some exciting news that we cannot share for now but as a result we must move our beautiful 35mm from its usual location into storage for a bit. We are not sure when it will be set back up so to celebrate we are running a marathon of six 35mm features across one Saturday!\n\nWe will kick off the first film at 1:30pm sharp on Saturday and will have a short dinner break after the third film. All going to plan we should be done by around 12:30am.\n\nIn terms of the features, we have films from the 1960s through to the early 2000s with a mix of comedies, sci-fi, horror and cult classics! Granted not all of these films would be considered masterpieces but there is nothing more fun than sitting in a crowd not knowing what could be coming next!\n\nWe will have a snack menu you can pre-order before the first film so aim to arrive around 1:00pm to order. The breaks between films will be very short (probably just enough time for the projectionist to thread up the next film) so make sure you come prepared for back-to-back screenings.\n\nThis event has strictly no digital projection, it\u2019s all film all the time. Now in theory it should all playback without a hitch as we are bringing in some of the best projectionist\u2019s Wellington has. But 35mm is a strange beast that can sometimes throw up the odd issue.\n\nFull marathon tickets (Admit) are $50\nHalf Marathon - Daytime are $30\nHalf Marathon - Evening are $30\n\nSeating is general admission and cinema entrance will be determined by earliest ticket purchase times.",

Inseparable in childhood, the brothers drifted apart as adults, brother Rocky (also O\u2019Brien) living out and proud in Portland while Roman lived a (decidedly hetero) tradie life in hometown Idaho. It seems he\u2019ll never have the chance to work through his complicated feelings towards his twin until stumbling upon a bereavement group for just such a purpose.\n\nThere he meets Dennis (James Sweeney).

They quickly become each other\u2019s emotional support twin-surrogate, on call for late night grocery trips, afterwork bitch sessions, and road trip singalongs.

Dame Anne Salmond writes of \u2018competing cosmologies\u2019 and \u2018ontological collisions\u2019 \u2014 European missionaries arriving in Aotearoa in the early 19th century brought a Biblical cosmology that began such a collision. In this public lecture Bradford Haami will explore the interactions between Biblical and M\u0101ori cultural and spiritual worldviews that continue to evolve up to the present.\n\n* How do Biblical and M\u0101ori cultural and spiritual beliefs and thought relate?\n* How 19th century rangatira negotiate between traditional beliefs and the Biblical narratives?\n* Where do Christian and M\u0101ori ways of knowing and seeing clash, compete or enrich each other?\n* What does being M\u0101ori and Christian look like today?\n\n\nBradford Haami (Ng\u0101ti Awa) is a M\u0101ori historian, researcher and author with research interests in M\u0101ori worldviews, spirituality, Christianity and cultural preservation. He is Pou Amorangi (M\u0101ori Director) at Laidlaw College in Auckland, New Zealand, where he lectures in biculturalism and sits on the governing board of the college.

The goal of these sessions is to spark and support the creation of AI tools and practices that best serve the aspirations of our students and wh\u0101nau, and blend well with the skills and insights of New Zealand's educators.\nPart 1:\nGenerative AI is already in Aotearoa\u2019s primary classrooms.  It is used by many teachers for planning and by \u0101konga both in and out of school.  However, policy, training, and culturally safe practice haven\u2019t always kept pace.\nIn this talk, David Coblentz will provide research-based insights into:\nteacher adoption patterns,\nwhat students say they\u2019re doing (and worrying about), and\nwhere schools are missing guidance.\nWe'll also discuss what AI sovereignty could mean in education in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nThen we can close with some practical steps for boards, leaders, kaiako, and wh\u0101nau to support constructive and equitable AI use in Years 5\u20138.\n*While the formal (and online) event will finish at 5pm, those attending in person are encouraged to stay on for snacks and drinks to share. Stay till 6pm or later, and get into the ideas more deeply, in a room full of good people.\nDavid Coblentz is a Senior Statistician at NZCER. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics, David holds advanced degrees in Biostatistics (MS), History (PhD), and International Studies (MA) from the University of Washington in Seattle.

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa.

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene.\nTiming:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLecture dates:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Porirua will show you how.  \nMost Porirua homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nPorirua has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Porirua.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Porirua is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

It incorporates satellite data, real-time generative music, and responds to audience movement in real-time. Using video and immersive sound, audiences will be challenged to reconsider the rhythm of living as humans. \nYou are invited to dive into the flow of the Southern Ocean and explore the pulse of the Antarctic circumpolar current. Participate by adjusting your walking patterns and breathing to \u2018regenerate\u2019 the world around you. Motion sensors will pick up your activity and adjust the environment to suit. At a sensorial level the effects of climate change will come to life. \n\nDestination Earth is a collaboration between Cellule Studio (UK) and Victoria University of Wellington. The work, by artist Salome Bazin, mixes art, science, and technology. It emphasises the urgent need to slow down human activity.  \n\nA bi-cultural perspective is also central to the experience. M\u0101ori symbolic views of the ocean are included, offering a richer narrative of the global climate.\n \nImage credit: Cellule Studio, directed by Salom\u00e9 Bazin.",

We invite you to THEA 303\u2019s \u2018Carnival of Chaos\u2019 in Studio 77, premiering hybrid works from the House of Echoes (1 & 3 October): The Odyssey, Medea\u202fand\u202fThe Devil is a Lover, and the House of Secrets (2 & 4 October): Rope, The Taming of the Shrew\u202f and\u202f God\u2019s Gift.\n\nEach adaptation has been directed, designed, produced, choreographed and managed by the students.\n\nHouse of Echoes (Season A): Performs on the 1st and the 3rd of October\n\nThe Odyssey \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Homer\u2019s The Odyssey\nOdysseus just wants to get home to his true love, but the journey isn\u2019t exactly smooth. The streets after 2 a.m. and too many beers are alive with obstacles; cops are grumpy, goth girls are tempting, and the help of the Gods is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought. Betrayal, hurt, and anger push her to the edge making her act in ways she never thought she would. \u201cHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned.\u201d\n\nThe Devil is a Lover \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Love Labours Lost\u202fand Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Devil is an Ass\nSatan and two devils, Beelzebub and Pug, make a pact to travel to a 1920s speakeasy on Earth and abstain from corruption for 3 years. As the narrative combines absurdist actions with Shakespearean dialogue, the three devils quickly learn of the difficulties present in avoiding corruption and the effect their devilish meddling has on humanity.\n\nHouse of Secrets (Season B): Performs on the 2nd and 4th of October\n\nRope \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Patrick Hamilton\u2019s\u202fRope\u202f(1929)\nNot a\u202fwhodunnit, but a\u202fhowdoyahideit? Marion and Melanie are sure they\u2019ve committed the perfect murder by killing their friend Norman and hiding his body in a chest, a chest their select group of friends have been invited over to have a murder mystery games night around. It\u2019s foolproof, until the over analytical Constance comes to play\u2026\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew\nIn 1970's Aotearoa, sisters Katherina and Bianca find their love lives complicated by their father's order that one may not pursue romance unless the other follows suit. The sudden appearance of a charming factory owner and friend of Bianca's beau could mark a new hope for the two, but will this lead to an ocean of love or does something far more sinister lurk beneath the surface?\n\nGod\u2019s Gift \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Alchemist\nThe Carnival has come to town in 1615 London. Lovewit has gone to see the show, leaving her manor in the hands of Jeremy the Butler, the \u201cAlchemist,\u201d and Dol, a hardworking prostitute. Lovewit\u2019s house becomes a place for schemes, with ample opportunities to take money from foolish men. Will Dol be happy with her split of the money?

When we connect to our inner foundations, we touch the support of those who came before and deepen our sense of belonging to life itself.\nWe\u2019ll begin with ceremonial cacao, then drop into a guided movement journey with live soundscape. There are no steps to learn, no performance\u2014just presence, curiosity, and letting your body move as it feels.
