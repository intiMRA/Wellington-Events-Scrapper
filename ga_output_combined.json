This exhibition will explore the tones, textures, composition and forms of the Chapel in black and white with many shades of grey.\n\"Generally, the older the equipment, the greater the personal input of the photographer is required and therefore the greater the commitment and individuality. Often, you can look at a 19th-century photograph and tell who the photographer is. You certainly can't do that today. It isn't only the camera and lens, but also the type of film (or in those days, glass plate), the developer used and how the print is made onto particular types of paper. Each gives a distinct interpretation\".\nJohn Grace - email - 18/06/25\nThe Trust looks forward to welcoming architects, designers, graduates, students and interested members of the public to attend this event and support the Trust in its work.\nThe Futuna Trust is a charitable organisation and all koha received from the exhibition events will go towards the ongoing care, maintenance and operation of Futuna Chapel and also to support various initiatives undertaken by the Trust.

These are lives shaped by love and politics, motherhood and memory, constraint and defiance.\nFrom girls raised in the garden of Plunket founder Truby King, to a queer university student at a mid-2000s Berlin rave, to a mother facing the cost of her son\u2019s climate rebellion, the women of All Her Lives are complex, resilient and deeply human. Shadowing their stories is the early feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, whose journey of grief and revolution will become a vessel for what endures \u2013 and for finding hope.\nVast and intimate, All Her Lives explores the layered selfhood of women \u2013 all that they inherit, sacrifice, imagine and carry forward \u2013 and the power found in unravelling and reweaving those selves on their own terms.\n'A wonderful collection that swims in and out of women's lives across time, exploring the struggle for freedom and love. I'll be thinking about it for a long time - a book of quiet force.' \u2014Emily Perkins, author of Lioness\nIngrid Horrocks\u2019s books include the memoir Where We Swim (2021), a literary history, Women Wanderers and the Writing of Mobility (2017), and two collections of poetry.

    "description": "Auditions! Superior Donuts by Tracy Letts, Auditions! Superior Donuts by Tracy Letts\nStagecraft presents: \u201cSuperior Donuts\u201d\nBy Tracy Letts\nDirected by James Kiesel\n26 November \u2013 6 December 2025\n\n\u201cWhat could be more human, than to be scared, and keep it a secret.\u201d\n\nArthur Przybyszewski (that's (p)Shub-er-shef-ski), is the proprietor of a modest, behind-the-times donut shop in uptown Chicago. He can't seem to find joy in anything these days, not even the donuts he used to take such pride in making by hand. Vandals armed with spray paint, predatory landlords, and that nefarious Starbucks down the road all threaten to unceremoniously snuff out the only thing he's got left.\n\nThat is, until an upstart, ambitious young man shoulders his way into becoming a Superior Donuts employee, and an unlikely friendship (or is it a rivalry?) develops, inspiring both to face the demons they've been hiding from all this time.\n\nThis is a sharp-witted, heartfelt comedy by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts (\u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d) offering a warm and wry take on depression, diversity, and bravery that will leave you feeling all fluffy and sugary on the inside. Plus, who knows, you might get a donut!\n\nGo to the Stagecraft website to book your spot!\n\nhttps://www.stagecraft.co.nz/auditions\n\nAUDITIONS:\nAuditions will be on Saturday 13th & Sunday 14th September, with callbacks the evening of Monday 15th September.\n\nTo book an audition, please fill out the form by 10th September - we'll be in touch to confirm your audition date, time and location. If you have any questions please get in touch at .\n\nRoles (just try your best with accents, coaching available once casting is complete)\n\nArthur Przybyszewski [Male, Polish, 50s - 60s]\nThe owner and operator of Superior Donuts. Old, grumpy, and more than a little depressed. Secretly an artisan and a scholar, he\u2019s spent his whole life running from conflict. Until now? [Has a scene involving some violence]\n\nFranco Wicks [Male, African-American, 20s]\nYoung, idealistic, a little pushy, and full of attitude and energy. Franco believes that good things will happen to him despite all odds, and evidence, to the contrary. A former employee of Luther.\n\nMax [Male, Russian, 40s - 60s]\nOwner of the DVD shop next door, Max is interested in buying Superior Donuts to expand his (tiny) capitalist empire. Fancies himself a self-made man. [Speaks in a Russian accent, along with some dialogue in Russian]\n\nRandy [Female, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nRaised in the middle of 7 brothers and working as a cop in the Chicago Police Department, Randy\u2019s always been \u2018one of the boys\u2019. Big hockey fan. Has a soft spot for Arthur.\n\nJames [Male, African-American, 30s - 40s]\nAnother cop with the Chicago Police Department and Randy\u2019s beat partner. Well-respected in the community and [not so] secretly a giant Star Trek nerd. [Will consider any and all BIPOC actors for this role]\n\nLady [Female, Irish-American, 60s - 70s]\nLikely homeless and definitely a little hard-of-hearing, Lady is a well-known as a confusing-but-likeable, perhaps even mascot-like figure in the Uptown community. Well past the point of giving a crap about what other people think.\n\nLuther [Male, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nLocal bookie and crime-syndicate everyman, Luther has scratched out his living taking money from gambling addicts, which he finds troubling because he\u2019d like to consider himself a good, fair man. Has a stomach ulcer which is probably somehow representative of this inner conflict. [Has a scene involving some violence]\n\nKevin [Male, Irish, 20s]\nAnother of Luther\u2019s employees, Kevin\u2019s probably fallen into the wrong crowd as a young man, but it doesn\u2019t seem to trouble him that much. Seems to care mostly about getting paid and drinking Coca-Cola.\n\nKiril [Male, Russian, 20s - 30s]\nA shy man of few words (mostly \u2018hello\u2019), Kiril is an intimidating figure with a big soft heart beating beneath his tall muscular frame. Brought into the fold to be a construction worker and bodyguard, he\u2019s mostly interested in falling in love with the local bartender. [Most dialogue is in Russian]\n\n",

These are lives shaped by love and politics, motherhood and memory, constraint and defiance.\n\nFrom girls raised in the garden of Plunket founder Truby King, to a queer university student at a mid-2000s Berlin rave, to a mother facing the cost of her son\u2019s climate rebellion, the women of All Her Lives are complex, resilient and deeply human. Shadowing their stories is the early feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, whose journey of grief and revolution will become a vessel for what endures \u2013 and for finding hope.\n\nVast and intimate, All Her Lives explores the layered selfhood of women \u2013 all that they inherit, sacrifice, imagine and carry forward \u2013 and the power found in unravelling and reweaving those selves on their own terms.\n\n'A wonderful collection that swims in and out of women's lives across time, exploring the struggle for freedom and love. I'll be thinking about it for a long time - a book of quiet force.' \u2014Emily Perkins, author of Lioness\n\nIngrid Horrocks\u2019s books include the memoir Where We Swim (2021), a literary history, Women Wanderers and the Writing of Mobility (2017), and two collections of poetry.

In 2024 she was the Kaituhi Tar\u0101whare CNZ Writer in Residence at the International Institute of Modern Letters, and in 2025 she was awarded the Michael King Writers Centre Australian Residency at Varuna.

Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it\u2019s going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa. Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show digs deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, family, and the undeniable need to keep moving\u2014no matter how creaky your knees may be.\n\nGet ready to laugh, reflect, and maybe even wince in recognition as GOMIL pedals its way across the country this spring. It\u2019s more than a show\u2014it\u2019s a celebration of growing older (and slightly wider) with humour, heart, and a healthy dose of spandex.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next chapter in this iconic Kiwi comedy saga. GOMIL is coming to a theatre near you\u2014lycra, laughter and all.\n\n",

Being open to these moments enhances our lives and the lives of those around us,' Dixey says.\n'In psychology, these tiny moments that stimulate positive feelings are called glimmers.'\nGold is a chemical element with the symbol Au and atomic number 79.\n'Welcome to Glimmers of Gold.'\nAbout Jo Dixey\nDixey is a Royal School of Needlework trained embroiderer. She teaches small groups a variety of embroidery techniques, works on commissions which have included large altar cloths, university banners and work for the fashion and movie industries, and repairs old embroideries. She holds exhibitions of her embroidered pieces every few years.\nIn 2017, Dixey published her first book Stitch People, which was later re-released as Creative Thread.\nHer work is held in private and public collections in New Zealand and overseas.

The Liverpool-born comic is celebrating 25 years in the business. His material usually draws from life experiences, and previous stand-up has covered observations about fatherhood, cycling around the world, playing semi-professional football, and his time working as a nightclub doorman. His Michael Fowler Centre show will undoubtedly showcase his famous natural charm and humility while delivering hilarious observations. \n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it will be 25 years since I first performed at the Frog and Bucket in Manchester. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster!\u201d says John. On top of stand-up comedy, he has found fame as a presenter. Among his many television appearances is \u2018John Bishop: In Conversation With\u2026\u2019 This series saw him chatting with some of the biggest names in entertainment, music and sport.

They trust each other, the audience, improv, and the moment to find their form. Nothing is decided beforehand.\n\nRich and Rebecca Sohn met as improvisers in Chicago over 30 years ago. As long-time teachers, this duo show began when former students asked them to headline a new evening of improv.

    "description": "Split Bill: Sohn Zone & D.E.I.'s, Sohn Zone - Rich & Rebecca Sohn\n\nThe Sohn Zone is a half hour of comedy, improvised in form and content, from Second City, Annoyance and iO Chicago veterans, Rich and Rebecca Sohn.\nThis show is organic. They trust each other, the audience, improv, and the moment to find their form. Nothing is decided beforehand.\n\nRich and Rebecca Sohn met as improvisers in Chicago over 30 years ago. As long-time teachers, this duo show began when former students asked them to headline a new evening of improv. Students often expressed surprise at how different their teaching styles were and took to saying \u201cyou\u2019re in the Sohn zone\u201d when seeing the couple work together.\n\nD.E.I.'s - Mo Munn & Ralph Hilaga\n\nWhen two besties land jobs at a prestigious company, they discover they\u2019re not there for their skills \u2014 they\u2019re the token hires. What follows is an improvised journey of chaos, corporate jargon, and an earnest attempt to prove they\u2019re more than just the diversity checkbox.\n\nFrom the chaotic minds of Wellington improv duo Mo and Ralph, D.E.I.\u2019s is a sharp, satirical, improvised workplace comedy about tokenism, identity, and the conundrums of modern day allyship. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what happens when the diversity quota starts talking back \u2014 this is it.\n\nAs the Sohn Zone is improvised, we cannot guarantee the presence or absence of specific content or themes beyond what is in the description above. The show may contain mature themes and language, but not gratuitously. D.E.I.'s contains strong language and adult themes, and discussions of topics like racism, queerness, and tokenism. Some material may touch on lived experiences of marginalisation and may be confronting for some audience members.\n\nBoth shows may contain voluntary audience interaction, such as giving a suggestion for a scene.",

Vignettes of characters similar to you, similar to me, similar to someone you may have been or may one day become, all on the path towards the Amber Temple.\nFrom the bowels of the molten earth, to the jowls of the predatory opportunist, to the angel casting light from celestial constellations, you will find yourself wrapped in a web from a sliver of time, a faraway place, perhaps an unknown space, as musician and dancer weave their tall tales of trials and tribulations, mortal life and looming death, unwavering love and venomous hate, environmentalism and satirical social commentary.\nAn original music and interpretive dance collaboration between singer-songwriter Julian Temple and contemporary dancer Amber Stephens.\nTemple, known mostly for his work in the eponymous Julian Temple Band has written all new works for the project while Stephens, a trained contemporary ballet dancer and choreographer who ran her own dance company in Vienna, has choreographed the interpretive dance for this unique performance.\n\u201cA live dancer added a visceral element to an already emotional performance. Having a responsive artist interacting and interpreting the music through movement only heightened the experience. It bridged the gap between performer and audience.\u201d\n- Ed Castelow - Dictaphone Blues\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be a converted fan of The Amber Temple before they\u2019ve even finished their first song. There\u2019s an obvious sense of originality, coupled with carefully crafted dance moments and some of the most intense and outstanding folk songwriting you\u2019ve heard. There\u2019s a feeling though that nothing is premeditated and that improvisation is the star of the show - the kind of performance that requires decades of experience. Luckily for us, Julian and Amber have this in spades. Do yourself a favour, I guarantee you\u2019ve seen nothing like it.\u201d\n- Sam Cullen - Singer/Songwriter\n\u201cEven having an understanding of the type of show The Amber Temple would be putting on when booking them - I was blown away by the amount of drama, tension and world-building Julian & Amber are able to accomplish in such an agile performance. The Amber Temple is a totally unique and utterly engaging experience which should be seen and celebrated.\u201d\n- Chris Scott - Seaside Music\nShow starts at 7 Presale tickets $20 (+BF) via undertheradar.co.nz or $25 on the door\n\"Vogelmorn Upstairs is not a wheelchair accessible building. There is an accessible\nbathroom in the space. This is an all ages venue but those under the age of 16 must be\naccompanied by a designated adult after 8pm.

I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation",

ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!! This booking is for FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER\n                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cWithin the DNA is written not only our histories as individuals but the whole history of the human race \u2026 patterns of DNA that have come down to us virtually unchanged from our distant ancestors \u2013 ancestors who are no longer just an abstract entity but real people who lived in conditions very different from those we enjoy today, who survived them and brought up their children.\u201d ~ Bryan Sykes (The Seven Daughters of Eve)\nReturn to MAIN EXHIBITION WEBSITE - link coming soon",

    "description": "Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days, Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days\nThis workshop is ideal for advanced students who have already learned how to set cabochon stones. Over two three-hour sessions, 20 and 27 September, 10am-1pm, you will be given an understanding of the technique of setting faceted stones using a setting burr, hammers, punches and burnishing tools. This is the first step in learning to flush set facet cut stones so they sit below the surface of the metal.\n\nSession 1 will cover the technique, demonstrations and the basics of preparing and cutting the setting. Students will be shown how to set their stones, and may begin to do this in class, but will then go on to repeat and practice the technique in their own time.\nThey can do this at home, or for a small extra cost, can stay on at the studio to practice setting for the afternoon.\n\nSession 2 will pick up on the setting techniques, reminding and refining essential steps in the process. Troubleshooting can be covered in this class, as well as learning to clean up the settings. The principles of this setting technique will be covered in a few different scenarios, as some students may wish to take this skill into different styles or directions.\n\nThe option for students to have a half-day bench hire after class will also apply to this session.\n\nWhat is provided: class fees cover your practice metal (copper) and stones (CZ) and detailed handouts that are useful for you to take away to refer to when practising and honing your skills.\n\nCorrectly sized drills and setting burrs will be provided in class, but students must purchase their own burrs for practice after class and any future bench hires. These are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nWhat to bring: Advanced students can bring projects to set stones into, but please note the metal must be at least 2mm thick and we do not allow brass to be used as a project or practice for beginners. The metal must be copper or sterling silver.\n\nStudents should bring either a craft magnifier or magnifying lenses/glasses. If you have your own flex shaft tool you plan to use at home for drilling and setting, please also bring this along so that your tutor can advise on the best way to use it. We have two drilling machines in the studio, and these must be shared between the students, so if you have a machine, do bring it.\n\nPractice bench hire after class $20 per person (till 4pm) must be booked in advance.\n\nWorkshop fee $195, Early bird $175 till 24 August.\n\n",

The goal of these sessions is to spark and support the creation of AI tools and practices that best serve the aspirations of our students and wh\u0101nau, and blend well with the skills and insights of New Zealand's educators.\nPart 1:\nGenerative AI is already in Aotearoa\u2019s primary classrooms.  It is used by many teachers for planning and by \u0101konga both in and out of school.  However, policy, training, and culturally safe practice haven\u2019t always kept pace.\nIn this talk, David Coblentz will provide research-based insights into:\nteacher adoption patterns,\nwhat students say they\u2019re doing (and worrying about), and\nwhere schools are missing guidance.\nWe'll also discuss what AI sovereignty could mean in education in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nThen we can close with some practical steps for boards, leaders, kaiako, and wh\u0101nau to support constructive and equitable AI use in Years 5\u20138.\n*While the formal (and online) event will finish at 5pm, those attending in person are encouraged to stay on for snacks and drinks to share. Stay till 6pm or later, and get into the ideas more deeply, in a room full of good people.\nDavid Coblentz is a Senior Statistician at NZCER. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics, David holds advanced degrees in Biostatistics (MS), History (PhD), and International Studies (MA) from the University of Washington in Seattle. Prior to coming to NZCER and transitioning into an educational research career in 2021, David worked as a biostatistician, data analytics director, and statistical consultant. David also has university teaching experience in history. His areas of interest include data analysis and data science, history education, evaluation, and AI in education.\nPart 2 will follow within two weeks of David Coblentz's presentation. It will be an online event that features two or three local AI in education developers, talking about their current development projects.\nWe intend to record both parts and make them available via our community site - https://community.sovereignai.nz/",

Over five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nDescription\nMany of us live sedentary lifestyles, sitting for up to eight hours or more a day hunched over our keyboard - all the while rarely taking a proper breath! Even if we wanted to take a deep enriching breath into the lower lobes of our lungs, we are limited due to our posture. Often due to the stresses and strains of a busy work and life balance, our unconscious brain can develop a pattern of holding, irregular and shadow breaths.\n\nDoes this sound like your experience?\n\nNot being able to breathe properly is the key cause of many chronic respiratory diseases (Nestor, 2020)\n\nCalligratherapy combines science journalist James Nestor's theory on proper breathing with the philosophy of ancient Chinese calligraphy to promote a state of optimal wellbeing.\n\nCalligratherapy has been developed specifically for those who have never practiced calligraphy before and who are interested in deriving the benefits without having to learn the language or all the characters. It integrates the simple and intuitive act of inhaling and exhaling into calligraphy practice with Eastern philosophy behind it.\n\nA range of different breathing exercises are embedded into each 90-minute session focusing on different calligraphy scripts. Over the five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing, while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nAll materials included in course fee.\n\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:\n\nStart a new creative practice in Chinese soft brush calligraphy\nDevelop your own mindfulness strategy\nBetter manage everyday stress levels and access a calm, empowered and positive state of mind\nFind ways to explore eastern philosophy and develop deeper connections with your spiritual self.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

Jem's debut graphic novel Folk Remedy Book 1 releases in September 2025, and she's busy working on Book 2. When not making comics you can find Jem dreaming up more story ideas and hanging out with her black cat. You can find her on social media @jemyoshioka most places (Instagram, BlueSky, TikTok, X)\nBuilding Sustainable Art Practices:\nIn 2025 it feels like it's challenging enough to survive as a person, let alone thrive as an artist. But art has the unique power to nourish us in ways nothing else can. In this workshop Jem will share some of the strategies, habits and tools she uses to fit in making graphic novels alongside full time employment without burning out. This session is practice-agnostic, and is designed to facilitate discussion about what a sustainable art practice can look like, how to build one, and how we can support each other when things are tough. No resources required but feel free to bring any notebooks or tools you use to manage your art or your time\n\nAfter that, we\u2019ll share some kai (potluck style), have a relaxed k\u014drero\nThe gathering will be held at a cozy private space in Wellington CBD, easily accessible by public transport.\nMessage us for the exact location: easternsoundcollective@gmail.com\nOr reach out on Instagram/Facebook: @easternsoundcollective\n",

    "description": "Financial Planning for Retirement, Financially successful people don\u2019t achieve their wealth by accident \u2013 they make and execute clear plans. Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly.

    "description": "Hands-on Sourdough Workshop, Sourdough for Beginners - $120 (paid via internet banking)\nCome join us for a hands-on, in-person sourdough workshop at Willow Corner Collective headquarters (aka my home)! This workshop is currently the only hands-on sourdough workshop being offered in the Nelson region - I teach and demonstrate to you and then you get to mix and practice on your own dough as we go along.\nWhether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this event is perfect for anyone looking to master the art of making sourdough bread, learning from someone who has 10+ years of experience. Perhaps you've found all the Youtube tutorials and Instagram how-to's overwhelming and are keen to learn via an in-person class. Then this is for you! I've baked hundreds of loaves in the last year alone, sold at a market, and hosted a pop-up shop. However, my passion really lies with teaching others to bake their own sourdough in their own homes, for their own families (or small businesses - one day!).You will be taught, demonstrated to, and then you get to have a go yourself; whilst learning my tips and tricks along the way. Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes and troubleshoot guide\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 6-8pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. If for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though. In extenuating circumstances I may be able to hold your ticket for a future workshop; this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n*Payment to clear in bank account two days after ticket bought, after which time your ticket will be released on to someone else. Please pay immediately upon purchasing ticket.\n**All workshop info you need to know ahead of time is in the confirmation email. Please ensure you read this down to the bottom.\n***I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\n\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight! From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody",

After the short break, we\u2019ll regroup for a Q&A session and finish with a tote bag-making activity led by Paek\u0101k\u0101riki artist Selina Tuomey.\n\nHe Kura Toi Tangata exhibition ends Sunday 12 October.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Gaayathri\n\nGaayathri Nair is a double diaspora person hailing from the southwest of India via Malaysia and coming to Aotearoa through economic migration in the 1980's under Rogernomics. She grew up in T\u0101maki Makaurau and now lives in Te Awakairangi and works in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. She is a counsellor and facilitator, novice gardener, passionate knitter, frazzled PhD student, and shares a home with a delightfully awkward greyhound named Kevin.\n\n\n\nAbout Krissi\n\nKrissi Smith is of primarily Scottish (Clans McColl, Ross, Hogarth, Sutherland, Buchanan, Mactavish), Irish and English descent, but she grew up in Te Upoko o te Ika on Taranaki Wh\u0101nui land. She currently lives in Te Ngaengae in Te Awakairangi, still on Taranaki Wh\u0101nui land, and close to Waiwhet\u016b. Krissi is a Tiriti educator, an accredited interpreter and translator, and a teacher of te reo M\u0101ori. She co-directs K\u016bwaha Ltd, with two of her besties: T\u0101whana Chadwick and Raih\u0101nia Tipoki. She's also a m\u0101m\u0101 to one kid, one step kid, and Nanna to one moko. She has three dogs and five chickens. She loves growing kai and cooking it for people, singing karaoke, and sewing. She's a lover of learning and is getting pretty damn comfortable with not knowing the answers!\n\n\n\nAbout Selina\n\nSelina Tuomey has an Irish father and an English mother. She came to Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa for the love of this land and a man. As a child in England, her most cherished possession was an Air New Zealand green, plastic tiki sent to her by her pen friend.\n\nShe is a mother to three sixth-generation, beautiful, young P\u0101keh\u0101 people. Selina has a Fine Art BA Hons and is all about art and nature, acting, painting, murals, clay play and drawing. She has a love of colour, growing trees, food and going bush.

    "description": "Honouring Te Tiriti: Totes, What does it actually mean to honour Te Tiriti?\n\nJoin Te Waka Huia for a three-part workshop where we will unpack our nation\u2019s constitutional founding document and explore practical ways to honour it today.\n\nThe session begins with k\u014drero facilitated by tauiwi (non-M\u0101ori) guides Gaayathri Nair and Krissi Smith followed by light manaaki and time to explore He Kura Toi Tangata: 50 Years of the Waitangi Tribunal, 1975\u20132025. After the short break, we\u2019ll regroup for a Q&A session and finish with a tote bag-making activity led by Paek\u0101k\u0101riki artist Selina Tuomey.\n\nHe Kura Toi Tangata exhibition ends Sunday 12 October.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Gaayathri\n\nGaayathri Nair is a double diaspora person hailing from the southwest of India via Malaysia and coming to Aotearoa through economic migration in the 1980's under Rogernomics. She grew up in T\u0101maki Makaurau and now lives in Te Awakairangi and works in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. She is a counsellor and facilitator, novice gardener, passionate knitter, frazzled PhD student, and shares a home with a delightfully awkward greyhound named Kevin.\n\n\n\nAbout Krissi\n\nKrissi Smith is of primarily Scottish (Clans McColl, Ross, Hogarth, Sutherland, Buchanan, Mactavish), Irish and English descent, but she grew up in Te Upoko o te Ika on Taranaki Wh\u0101nui land. She currently lives in Te Ngaengae in Te Awakairangi, still on Taranaki Wh\u0101nui land, and close to Waiwhet\u016b. Krissi is a Tiriti educator, an accredited interpreter and translator, and a teacher of te reo M\u0101ori. She co-directs K\u016bwaha Ltd, with two of her besties: T\u0101whana Chadwick and Raih\u0101nia Tipoki. She's also a m\u0101m\u0101 to one kid, one step kid, and Nanna to one moko. She has three dogs and five chickens. She loves growing kai and cooking it for people, singing karaoke, and sewing. She's a lover of learning and is getting pretty damn comfortable with not knowing the answers!\n\n\n\nAbout Selina\n\nSelina Tuomey has an Irish father and an English mother. She came to Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa for the love of this land and a man. As a child in England, her most cherished possession was an Air New Zealand green, plastic tiki sent to her by her pen friend.\n\nShe is a mother to three sixth-generation, beautiful, young P\u0101keh\u0101 people. Selina has a Fine Art BA Hons and is all about art and nature, acting, painting, murals, clay play and drawing. She has a love of colour, growing trees, food and going bush. Selina is a mermaid and loves people. He tangata, he tangata, he tangata.",

Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years.

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene and GIB.\nCPD points: 10\nTIMING:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLECTURE DATES:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

Max 5 people.\nCome and have a go at wet-plate collodion photography, using authentic materials to produce your own heirloom image as were made 170 years ago. This almost lost art produces one-of-a-kind images on tin or glass plates, which you create and have an image you\u2019ve crafted to take away.\n\nBrian Scadden will be your instructor for this workshop. Brain has been passionate about photography for over 40 years, beginning his career at the National Film Unit in the 1970s before joining Park Road Post Production as Head of Laboratory, Head of Picture, and Restoration Manager. His work in film sparked an interest in early photographic techniques, prompting him to master wet-plate collodion photography. In 2006, he was invited to assist leading wet-plate experts in the USA and has since taught many New Zealanders this challenging process. Jane, who attended Brian\u2019s workshop in 2014, later married him in 2019 and completed a photographic project in Carterton in 2016.\nAlthough Brian retired in 2015, he returned for short-term assignments at Park Road Post and part-time work at Archive NZ, supporting film archiving until mid-2023. Both Brian and Jane continue to shoot with 35mm and 120mm film using vintage cameras from their collection.\n\nNOTE: Link for booking tickets coming soon.\n\nEmail:\nwww.greytownarttown.com\n\n",

    "description": "You Spot It You Got It: Unpacking cultural conditioning and turning the mirror inwards, Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Pacific style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and effective insights. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from different communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from You Spot It, You Got It?\nIn You Spot It, You Got It, you will deepen self-awareness by being encouraged to recognise some of your own conditioning and impacts of this in your daily life/practices. When we are not conscious of the things that might not sit right within us then we unknowingly or knowingly project them onto others. What we reject, we project. By examining patterns and recognising our conditioning, then we can truly understand how we can live in more conscious ways. This Talanoa Tai learning experience offers space for talanoa, tools and exercises to facilitate introspection and personal growth by turning the mirror inwards.\nThis is a 3.5 hour in-person learning experience. The day will start with a mihi whakatau to welcome you into the space.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\nFacilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives.

John Campbell highlights some consistent themes of Brian Tamaki's Destiny Church: far-right prejudices, manifest anger, and hatred.\nIn Auckland on 21 June, Destiny Church organised a march to take \"a bold public stand for Christian values, Kiwi identity and the future of this nation\".\nOn Saturday, 13 September, Brian Tamaki attended the London \u201cUnite the Kingdom\u201d protest organised by far-right political activist Tommy Robinson that claimed to celebrate 'free speech', but also contained chants of hate, racist conspiracy theories, and Christian nationalist slogans. Among disturbing scenes, some people in the crowd ripped up a flag that read 'Secular Humanism'. To them, the very idea that people of all backgrounds and beliefs can live together with equality and respect is something to fear and destroy. For decades, the far right in the USA has painted humanism as a bogeyman, blaming it for liberal values, the rights of women, and the rights of LGBT people. It shows that those who thrive on fear are deliberately targeting the very values that underpin human rights and human dignity. Humanism is not a fringe or \u2018woke\u2019 idea. It is about fairness. It is about reason. It is about believing in the good that people are capable of when they are free to live their lives without fear or prejudice. These protests, which Brian Tamaki is supporting, are a show of force from those who wish to undo progress, to divide communities, and to undermine cherished freedoms.\nWe have a growing concern for secular values in our community. We cannot be silent. It is essential to keep compassion alive in public life and politics. After watching the documentary, we will discuss our concerns and how we might respond.\nTime: Oct 6, 2025 06:30 PM Auckland, Wellington\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/88183700512...\n",

    "description": "PANEL TALK: BALLROOM CULTURE, Ballroom is a queer subculture. The Ballroom scene today was created by Black and Latinx trans women in the late 1960s in Harlem, New York. Since then, ballroom has taken over the world with scenes in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania.\nThe Aotearoa Ballroom scene was ignited by M\u0101ori and MVPFAFF+ youth in T\u0101maki Makaurau over 10 years ago, and has since inspired other leaders across the motu to forge their own Ballroom communities in their respective cities. \nIn preparation for The Grand Kiki House of Marama Ball, hear from influential figures who have made significant contributions to their own scenes. With international Icons and Legends coming to Aotearoa for the first time, there has never been a better time to learn and enhance our own knowledge and experience of Ballroom. \nFeaturing ballroom leaders Arturo Mulan (NYC, USA), Matyouz Royalty (Paris, EU), Jaycee Iman (Auckland, NZ), Karamera Marama and Rom\u00e9 Marama.\nPanellists\nIcon Arturo Mulan (NYC Father of the International House of Miyake-Mugler) (he/him) is a ballroom Icon and Legend from the beating heart of Ballroom, NYC.

Matyouz has become a staple commentator and music artist within the ballroom community, with a repertoire of modelling and influencer opportunities in their resum\u00e9.\nLegendary Overall Founding Mother Jaycee Iman aka Jaycee Tanuvasa (she/her) is an inter-disciplinary S\u0101moan artist and choreographer of fa\u2019afafine, femme queen & trans experience.

They trust each other, the audience, improv, and the moment to find their form. Nothing is decided beforehand.\n\nRich and Rebecca Sohn met as improvisers in Chicago over 30 years ago. As long-time teachers, this duo show began when former students asked them to headline a new evening of improv. Students often expressed surprise at how different their teaching styles were and took to saying \u201cyou\u2019re in the Sohn zone\u201d when seeing the couple work together.\n\nD.E.I.'s - Mo Munn & Ralph Hilaga\n\nWhen two besties land jobs at a prestigious company, they discover they\u2019re not there for their skills \u2014 they\u2019re the token hires. What follows is an improvised journey of chaos, corporate jargon, and an earnest attempt to prove they\u2019re more than just the diversity checkbox.\n\nFrom the chaotic minds of Wellington improv duo Mo and Ralph, D.E.I.\u2019s is a sharp, satirical, improvised workplace comedy about tokenism, identity, and the conundrums of modern day allyship. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what happens when the diversity quota starts talking back \u2014 this is it.\n\nAs the Sohn Zone is improvised, we cannot guarantee the presence or absence of specific content or themes beyond what is in the description above. The show may contain mature themes and language, but not gratuitously. D.E.I.'s contains strong language and adult themes, and discussions of topics like racism, queerness, and tokenism. Some material may touch on lived experiences of marginalisation and may be confronting for some audience members.\n\nBoth shows may contain voluntary audience interaction, such as giving a suggestion for a scene.",

Whether you both want to connect after that is up to you, but this is the time to shoot your shot!\n\nAfter purchasing a ticket, you will be sent a short questionnaire. Please fill it out promptly! This helps the organisers place you in groups with similar interests so you have the best chance at finding what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nNo TERFs no SWERFs. This event is open to all people 18+ who identify as sapphic/lesbian/queer. Bi, pan, questioning, and ace folks are all welcome.\n\nAdditional info:\n- Most dietary requirements can be accommodated by the amazing chefs at Everybody Eats.

By 1917 the system had grown and 17 was rebuilt into its current form adding a set of trucks converting the tram to 8 wheels. Tram tram saw regular service until the 1940\u2019s where it was eventually use for peak time travel, before being withdrawn in the late 50\u2019s.\nIt was then sold, and taken to Bell road in Raumati on the Kapiti coast where it served as a beach hutt until the 80\u2019s where it was donated to the Wellington tramway museum for display and eventual restoration.\n2014 a conservation and restoration plan was put together, and the tram was shipped out to the Wheelwright Shop in the Wairarapa for a full body overhaul. It was transported back to the museum in 2017 and put on public display until new trucks (wheelsets) could be manufacturedby A&G price in Thames.\nSince 2019 the tram has undergone new wiring, and extensive testing and running in and is now ready to take passengers along our museum.\nTram 17 is a wonderful achievement by all\nThose involved, and we cannot wait to welcome you this Father\u2019s Day to enjoy a ride on this heritage tram, saved from the scrap heap, and then saved again from rotting away.\nPlease note: We intend to run tram 17, however due to the nature and style of the tram, its operation is weather dependent. If we deem that the tram cannot run, we will advise accordingly. ",

Insights that very few others trainers or training programs in this country provide. He has had an interest on the impact of social exclusion, alienation and discrimination on mens's wellbeing and advocates for a human rights based, systems change and person-centred approach to wellbeing.The workshop is enriched by the learnings from Barry's own lived experience of depression and suicidality and his pathway to recovery.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to effectively respond to the unacceptably high rate of male suicide in this country.\n\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

This project aims to bring the community together to restore the hillsides of the Belmont Regional Park.\n\nWe provide all the tools and training, no prior experience needed. We can even provide transport to the site. Just bring your energy and lunch. We will provide you with a yummy morning tea.\n\nCome have some fun planting with us and TAKE ACTION FOR NATURE!\n\nThis event is part of Conservation Week 2025 - www.doc.govt.nz/conservationweek\n\nSign up for this event on our website ConservationVolunteers.co.nz or email Wellington@cvnz.org.nz",

    "description": "CMNZ Series Four Last Songs, Composed in the year before his passing, the 'Four Last Songs' are held by many to be Richard Strauss\u2019 most beautiful, sensuous, and moving composition. They are songs of farewell and of gentle heartbreak. The words of the final song, 'Im Abendrot', speak of an elderly couple walking hand in hand, at rest from their wanderings, away from life. The final verse:\n\nO weiter, stiller Friede! O vast and silent peace!\nSo tief im Abendrot So deep in sunset glow,\nWie sind wir wanderm\u00fcde- How weary we are with wandering-\nIst dies etwa der Tod? Could this perhaps be death?\n\nFor this special premiere performance, Salina Fisher has arranged the 'Four Last Songs' for NZTrio and celebrated Australian soprano Emma Pearson.",

It prevents native plants from establishing by forming dense stands of salt and wind tolerant bushes that grow on steep escarpments. Join us to help remove 1000 of these plants across two weeding sessions! A point schedule helps you to get motivated and compete for the highly coveted Thorburn 1k medal.\nPlease meet at the intersection of Te Ranga-a-Hiwi and Ruru tracks.

    "description": "Carnival of Chaos, Myth, chaos, murder, alchemy, mystery, and devils are afoot in this four-night festival featuring six short retellings of classic works with strange new twists! We invite you to THEA 303\u2019s \u2018Carnival of Chaos\u2019 in Studio 77, premiering hybrid works from the House of Echoes (1 & 3 October): The Odyssey, Medea\u202fand\u202fThe Devil is a Lover, and the House of Secrets (2 & 4 October): Rope, The Taming of the Shrew\u202f and\u202f God\u2019s Gift.\n\nEach adaptation has been directed, designed, produced, choreographed and managed by the students.\n\nHouse of Echoes (Season A): Performs on the 1st and the 3rd of October\n\nThe Odyssey \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Homer\u2019s The Odyssey\nOdysseus just wants to get home to his true love, but the journey isn\u2019t exactly smooth. The streets after 2 a.m. and too many beers are alive with obstacles; cops are grumpy, goth girls are tempting, and the help of the Gods is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought. Betrayal, hurt, and anger push her to the edge making her act in ways she never thought she would. \u201cHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned.\u201d\n\nThe Devil is a Lover \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Love Labours Lost\u202fand Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Devil is an Ass\nSatan and two devils, Beelzebub and Pug, make a pact to travel to a 1920s speakeasy on Earth and abstain from corruption for 3 years. As the narrative combines absurdist actions with Shakespearean dialogue, the three devils quickly learn of the difficulties present in avoiding corruption and the effect their devilish meddling has on humanity.\n\nHouse of Secrets (Season B): Performs on the 2nd and 4th of October\n\nRope \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Patrick Hamilton\u2019s\u202fRope\u202f(1929)\nNot a\u202fwhodunnit, but a\u202fhowdoyahideit? Marion and Melanie are sure they\u2019ve committed the perfect murder by killing their friend Norman and hiding his body in a chest, a chest their select group of friends have been invited over to have a murder mystery games night around. It\u2019s foolproof, until the over analytical Constance comes to play\u2026\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew\nIn 1970's Aotearoa, sisters Katherina and Bianca find their love lives complicated by their father's order that one may not pursue romance unless the other follows suit. The sudden appearance of a charming factory owner and friend of Bianca's beau could mark a new hope for the two, but will this lead to an ocean of love or does something far more sinister lurk beneath the surface?\n\nGod\u2019s Gift \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Alchemist\nThe Carnival has come to town in 1615 London. Lovewit has gone to see the show, leaving her manor in the hands of Jeremy the Butler, the \u201cAlchemist,\u201d and Dol, a hardworking prostitute. Lovewit\u2019s house becomes a place for schemes, with ample opportunities to take money from foolish men. Will Dol be happy with her split of the money? Or will a surprise visitor shake things up?\n\nContent Forecast: mentions of and implied sexual violence and domestic abuse, mentions of drug use, strobe lighting, violence, coarse language, loud noises, haze, and smoke.",

We invite you to THEA 303\u2019s \u2018Carnival of Chaos\u2019 in Studio 77, premiering hybrid works from the House of Echoes (1 & 3 October): The Odyssey, Medea\u202fand\u202fThe Devil is a Lover, and the House of Secrets (2 & 4 October): Rope, The Taming of the Shrew\u202f and\u202f God\u2019s Gift.\n\nEach adaptation has been directed, designed, produced, choreographed and managed by the students.\n\nHouse of Echoes (Season A): Performs on the 1st and the 3rd of October\n\nThe Odyssey \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Homer\u2019s The Odyssey\nOdysseus just wants to get home to his true love, but the journey isn\u2019t exactly smooth. The streets after 2 a.m. and too many beers are alive with obstacles; cops are grumpy, goth girls are tempting, and the help of the Gods is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought. Betrayal, hurt, and anger push her to the edge making her act in ways she never thought she would. \u201cHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned.\u201d\n\nThe Devil is a Lover \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Love Labours Lost\u202fand Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Devil is an Ass\nSatan and two devils, Beelzebub and Pug, make a pact to travel to a 1920s speakeasy on Earth and abstain from corruption for 3 years.

Marion and Melanie are sure they\u2019ve committed the perfect murder by killing their friend Norman and hiding his body in a chest, a chest their select group of friends have been invited over to have a murder mystery games night around. It\u2019s foolproof, until the over analytical Constance comes to play\u2026\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew\nIn 1970's Aotearoa, sisters Katherina and Bianca find their love lives complicated by their father's order that one may not pursue romance unless the other follows suit. The sudden appearance of a charming factory owner and friend of Bianca's beau could mark a new hope for the two, but will this lead to an ocean of love or does something far more sinister lurk beneath the surface?\n\nGod\u2019s Gift \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Alchemist\nThe Carnival has come to town in 1615 London. Lovewit has gone to see the show, leaving her manor in the hands of Jeremy the Butler, the \u201cAlchemist,\u201d and Dol, a hardworking prostitute. Lovewit\u2019s house becomes a place for schemes, with ample opportunities to take money from foolish men. Will Dol be happy with her split of the money? Or will a surprise visitor shake things up?\n\nContent Forecast: mentions of and implied sexual violence and domestic abuse, mentions of drug use, strobe lighting, violence, coarse language, loud noises, haze, and smoke.",

Each garden tells a story and provides a visual image of wonderful creations.\nOne garden, allegedly with the best vista, has not been opened to the public before. One garden has previously featured in the House and Garden magazine. The tour (self-guided) will begin with lunch and an opportunity to buy potted plants in the tranquil St Alban's church garden, 11 Ngaio St Eastbourne, Lower Hutt, Wellington. The tour will end with hors d'oeuvre, wine and live music in the last garden.\nThis is a chance not just to visit amazing gardens but support the earthquake strengthening of St Alban's historic church and hall for a rejuvenated community hub.\nSt Albans church garden\nThe six private gardens all lie within a less than 100 m walk of the 83 Metlink Marine Parade bus route, but a car or bicycle would be more convenient.\nA glimpse of the six separate gardens (a-e).\na\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\nf\nThe garden show is in support of earthquake strengthening of the de Jersey Clere designed St Alban's church and adjacent hall to remake this a community hub.\nFor the last hundred years and more, this beautiful church designed by acclaimed architect Frederick de Jersey Clere has been the heart of Anglican parish life for people in the eastern bays of Wellington. People have rejoiced, prayed and wept in it through happy family milestones and sad occasions, through two world wars and countless celebrations and crises. Along with its parish hall and tranquil garden, it has been the base for social and community services and outreach, and its memorial wall houses the ashes of local residents.\nBut in 2016 the congregation had to suddenly leave the church, which was deemed an earthquake risk.\nSince then, the parish has explored alternatives for continuing its life and service to the people of the eastern bays. In that process it has kept its ministry and worship going through borrowed premises in local schools and other churches. Now, however, the parish has decided it needs to go back to its original base and strengthen both St Alban\u2019s Church and the parish hall so it can continue to serve the community from its heart and home in Ngaio Street, for the next hundred years and more.\nDetailed plans for strengthening the church and hall to meet acceptable safety standards have been drawn up, and fund-raising is under way. The parish is a registered charity (CC22188) and tax-deductible receipts will be issued for all donations.\nPostponement by 1 day to 30 Nov if weather were to dictate and would be announced on this web site.",

By integrating creative writing into your painting practice, you can enhance your imagination, storytelling abilities, emotional expression, attention to detail, and personal style on the canvas. Please bring along a journal or laptop.\n\nCOURSE CONTENT\nEach session presents a key idea backed by research or concrete examples, followed by practical writing exercises with optional sharing. We learn by doing and from each other.\n\n1. Generating work from the interior: tapping into memories, conflict, emotion, and observation to generate art.\n2. Figuring out what matters to you, then learning how to grow your fragmented ideas into something whole. For example, how do you turn a feeling, or a fleeting moment in time into a story? Into a painting? Into a work of art? What are the building blocks you need?\n3. Inspiration from other creative sources: people, music, poetry, reading, random incidents. Ways to generate fresh ideas. How to clarify and focus in writing and art.\n4. Structure and boundaries. Dreaming big but being real. How do you find and stick to a creative process? Understanding how you learn and what kind of feedback you need. Designing your next project.\n\nThursday mornings, 9:30 - 11:45 am.\n4 - 25 September.",

Most props are provided but feel free to bring your own yoga mat for extra comfort as well as a cushion, blanket, socks and an eye pillow if you have one.\n\nThis class is suitable for all - no previous experience is required.\n\nLIMITED SPACES AVAILABLE.\nTWILIGHT SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/5a2pad44\nMORNING SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/mw82z38u\n\nRestorative yoga is a practice of deep relaxation in which yoga poses (asanas) are held for several minutes with the use of props such as blocks, bolster and blankets to support the body in gentle stretch.\n\nWhen your body enters a state of relaxation, your mind will also relax. Once you have been guided to let go of any tension held in your body, all that is required is for you to pay attention to your breath, becoming aware of any thoughts that may arise, and then gently releasing them.\n\nThis restful practice calms both mind and body, allowing the nervous system to enter its parasympathetic state \u2013 the state of \u201crest and digest\u201d, in which healing is enabled and enhanced.\n\nAbout Cacao\nCacao is a superfood. It is plant medicine at its finest. Its scientific name, Theobroma cacao, translates to \"food of the Gods.\" Containing many minerals, vitamins and phytonutrients such as flavonoids and antioxidants, it is also an extremely potent adaptogen that encourages the body to come into balance.\n\nCacao has a particularly strong influence on the heart \u2013 both physiologically and energetically. Cacao anecdotally is reported to enhance connection in community, hence its beauty in being shared in circle.\n\nIn Jenny's experience, cacao seems to enhance whatever it is that you are doing \u2013 be it running a marathon or meditating \u2013 cacao can make you go deeper, further, longer, stronger. However she does seem to have a mind of her own so be open to the experience she offers you \u2013 it may not always go quite how you planned!\n\nCacao is very safe and tolerated well by most people. However it is to be used with caution by people who are taking high doses of SSRIs. Cacao releases serotonin, so it works as a mild antidepressant. When taken with SSRIs that release serotonin chemically it can lead to serotonin syndrome. Individuals taking MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should avoid consuming ceremonial cacao due to potential interactions.\n\nThis workshop is part of Pukerua Bay Hub's 2025 Pop-up Parlour - thanks for your support.\n\n____________________________________\nWHAT IS THE POP-UP PARLOUR?\nA chance to create and connect in our pop-up community space. From 1-30 September we've got a jam-packed schedule with 65+ events for kids, families, rangatahi and adults to learn, hang out and have fun.\n\nCheck out all the free/koha events too -\nhttps://www.pkbhub.org.nz/whatson\n\nWaiho i te toipoto, kaua i te toi roa \u2013\nLet us keep close together, not far apart.\n\n",

    "description": "Slow Grind Fever [AUS] - Wellington Jazz Festival, Express from Melbourne, Australia and crossing international waters for the first time this October, Meow is excited to welcome the slowest, spookiest, smokiest and swingin-est club night Wellington has ever seen: 'Slow Grind Fever'.\nFor this one-night-only episode of SGF Wellington, founder Richie1250 (106.7 PBS FM) will be joined by fellow Melbourne radio alumnus Dr. Popalotacorn (RRR, 98.1FM Raglan) and Wellington's own belle of the airwaves Miss Juliet (RadioActive.FM Americana)\nSlow Grind Fever was born in 2012 when Richie1250 hired a Russian Cultural Centre ballroom and threw a slow dance party for his 30th birthday, and it's been running as a regular monthly club night ever since. Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

    "description": "NZIFF: Went Up the Hill, An unsettling, sinister slow-burn thriller, Samuel Van Grinsven unites rising star Dacre Montgomery with Phantom Thread\u2019s Vicky Krieps and New Zealand\u2019s own Sarah Peirse for a supernatural chiller like no other.\n\nIn the icy, shadow-stricken world of Went Up the Hill\u2019s Christchurch, it would seem that the death of Elizabeth, wife of Jill (Vicky Krieps), has taken with it warmth itself. The unexpected suicide of her partner has left her a hollowed-out shell \u2013 that is, until Jack (Dacre Montgomery), Elizabeth\u2019s long-absent son, arrives at the funeral, apparently invited by Jill herself, though she does not remember doing so.\n\nThe circumstances of Jack\u2019s long absence are unclear \u2013 all that is known is that Jack was given up for adoption at a very young age. Staying the night at Jill and Elizabeth\u2019s oppressive, concrete-clad mountain abode, it quickly becomes clear that the spirit of Elizabeth has not yet departed \u2013 instead, she has gained the ability to possess both wife and son and is utilising this ability to linger and address the needs of either relationship. What initially seems to be a gift from beyond, however, begins to sour when long-hidden secrets of the past begin to emerge, and lines between the two begin to be crossed.\n\nThe sophomore feature of Samuel Van Grinsven, Went Up the Hill is a wintry, gothic affair, and a showcase for the untapped talents of Montgomery, who most will recognise as the golden-haired, ill-fated muscle mutt Billy from Stranger Things. Essentially a two-hander (with occasional, welcome interjection from Kiwi legend Sarah Peirse as Jack\u2019s frosty, mystery-shrouded aunt), Van Grinsven tracks the trajectory of these two adrift people and the spirit between them \u2013 from unexpected refuge, to joy, to dread \u2013 with a purposeful, drip-fed escalation of tension. Questions of control, abuse and the lingering weight of past scars take hold, all while the usually pleasantly scenic Christchurch landscape is transformed into a suffocatingly claustrophobic ice prison. Van Grinsven\u2019s muscular direction bears none of the flashy excesses of an emerging filmmaker \u2013 his vision emerges, stately, imposing and fully-formed. \u2014 Tom Augustine",

    "description": "XCOMMUNICATE, XCOMMUNICATE\nThe formidable powerhouse duo COMMUNICATE return to Wellington in November with their clubnight, XCOMMUNICATE, for one night only.\n\nKnown for their long sets that incorporate decades of sound, Cyril Orson and Heylady have been punishing dance floors across Aotearoa since they joined forces 3 years ago. Off the back of a monstrous summer, which saw them play 19 shows up and down the country, the pair have spent most of 2025 in the studio finessing their own brand of audio alchemy and preparing to release their label, also named XCOMMUNICATE.\n\nUsually XCOMMUNICATE is a 6 hour journey though decades and sonic realms, however as Heylady is still recovering from a mighty dose of burnout they\u2019ve roped in a couple of their good friends, who happen to be some of Wellington\u2019s finest, to join them as they lay down four hours of four to the floor.\n\nHalo is a mainstay on Wellington dancefloors and it was a no brainer asking her to be on this lineup. A DJ since 2000, she has played festivals across the country and never fails to rock her slot. Her set at Taniwha\u2019s Den last summer was a big highlight and one of the best of the festival. Halo\u2019s ability to drive forward thinking sound and her clever construction of sets are just two reasons you need to be on her floor.\n\nDJ Coda is the godfather of techno in New Zealand. With a career that spans decades, he isn\u2019t just a DJ but a dedicated promoter and one of the trustees of NZ\u2019s longest running student radio station, Radio Active. Part of the COMMUNICATE family from the get go (and a longtime collaborator of Heylady\u2019s), DJ Coda is a master of his craft and never fails to deliver. Armed with knowledge , taste and a hefty love of Detroit, DJ Coda is the man when it comes to rocking the dance floor.\nFirst release tickets are on sale now, grab yours before they are gone and come and dance the evening away with four of the best. We recommend arrive early so you don\u2019t miss out on any of the sets, they are all going to be killer.\n\nIMPORTANT INFO:\nOur event is a safe space for all. If you or someone you know is feeling unsafe or harassed, please approach one of the DJs or bar staff. If you are behaving badly and impacting others ability to have a good time safely, you will be removed. Please act with respect and care for your fellow attendees at all times, no means no and this goes for conversations as well as more intimate requests.\n\n",

Set in 1954, the film follows Esmeralda Arboleda, a fiercely intelligent leader who sparks a revolution in a society deeply rooted in patriarchal traditions - a revolution that culminates in a fierce and decisve debate. A women group embarks on a historic struggle to bring the issue of women's right to vote before the National Constituent Assembly. With bold marches, radio appearances, and a brilliant media strategy that puts them on the front page, they achieve their goal, but the real challenge begins during the debate, where they face fierce opposition. Esmeralda Arboleda must endure personal attacks from the assembly members, and just as she is about to speak, she receives a heartbreaking call: her son has suffered a serious accident. She is torn between her duty as a mother and her commitment to the cause, with an unfavorable outcome. Although all seems to be lost, her perseverance leads to a historic victory when women's suffrage is finally approved, marking a turning point in Colombia's history.\n\n",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

He made four feature-length films during New Zealand\u2019s silent film era, later navigating the financial challenges of accessing new sound equipment to make documentaries, educational films, and two more feature films \u2014 Rewi\u2019s Last Stand (1940) and the first New Zealand film to be shot in colour, To Love a M\u0101ori (1972).\n\nDrawing on research for her biography of Rudall Hayward and his family, Annabel Cooper will explore his enduring contributions to cinema, his collaborative work with his wives Hilda and Ramai, and the cultural legacy he left behind.\n\nA Friends of the Turnbull Library event\nThe Friends of the Turnbull Library, Ng\u0101 Hoa o te Whare Pukapuka Turnbull, offers a monthly programme of free public talks.

With a deep adoration for Pacific musical reference points and a desire to explore new sonic ground, LEAO synthesises non-traditional tonalities with a fa\u2018asamoa spirit, creating what some have called \u201cniu wave\u201d and \u201cPacific neo-psychedelia.\u201d A creative enigma and phenomenal live act since the release of their critically acclaimed debut GHOST ROADS in 2019, LEAO has continued to expand its vision with the 2024 single TAEAO / MEA UMA - a sparkling glimpse into a significant body of alternative Pacific music currently in development. The group is now actively working towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\n\nRomi Wrights\n\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring stories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke festival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release mid to late 2025.",

    "description": "Treasury Guest Lecture with Michael Keen: IN-PERSON attendance, Join us for our special Fiscal Policy for the Future seminar\nNew Zealand faces significant long-term fiscal challenges, including the rising costs associated with an ageing population, increasing demand for public services, and the need to adapt to a changing global economy. These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand. The Trust was established to support leading tax policy thinking in New Zealand. You can read about the Trust\u2019s work here.\nAbout the presenter\nMichael (Mick) Keen is a former Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, where for over twenty years he played a central role in shaping and delivering IMF policies and advice on tax matters.\nHe has advised finance ministries in all parts of the world, including missions to over forty countries, and led the preparation of influential papers for the G20 and the Executive Board of the IMF.\nBefore joining the Fund, Mick was Professor of Economics at the universities of Essex (UK), Queens (Canada) and Kyoto, and is now Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo.\nMick was the keynote speaker at the 2014 conference on the Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand and has provided peer review for Inland Revenue\u2019s previous Long-Term Insights Briefing.\nMick has jointly authored, with Joel Slemrod, Rebellion, Rascals and Revenue \u2013 an entertaining account of how history illuminates the perennial challenges and timeless principles of taxation\u2014and how the past holds clues to solving the tax problems of today.\nAbout this seminar series\nNew ideas, innovative concepts, research evidence and expert advice are all crucial to stimulate and inform the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis and advice. Our current theme for guest lectures - Fiscal Policy for the Future - explores the role of stabilising, sustainable and effective fiscal policy. Speakers provide insights into how fiscal policy can be designed to support government to meet its current and future objectives and obligations while adapting to changing circumstances and delivering value to the New Zealand public.\nFiscal policy has a stabilising role in helping to smooth the business cycle, while sustainability in fiscal policy is foundational for resilience to both shocks and longstanding challenges, such as climate change, technological advancements, and demographic trends. Ensuring effective and value for money expenditure is important so that fiscal policy contributes to the living standards of New Zealanders, both now and in the future.\nPlease note that the views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series are those of the individual presenters. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the New Zealand Treasury or the New Zealand Government.\nFor updates and our latest research visit: www.treasury.govt.nz\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to be the first to hear about our upcoming events in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series, please SUBSCRIBE to stay up to date.",

    "description": "Martial Law Film Screening, In remembrance of the victims of human rights violations and extrajudicial killings during the Martial Law in the Philippines, please join us for a free/koha screening of the \"Batas Militar\" documentary in Te Whanganui-a-Tara.\nNOTE: For a list of trigger warnings, please see this document. Since we will be viewing and discussing potentially sensitive topics, the event will have an Open Door Policy, which means that you may leave the venue any time, for any reason, and will not be judged for doing so.\nWHAT IS MARTIAL LAW?\n\"Martial law refers to the replacement of civil rule by military rule. This may be characterized by curfews, the dispensation of military tribunal rulings on civilians, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, which in Latin refers to \u201chaving the body\u201d, is a citizen\u2019s protection against unlawful imprisonment. This is suspended in times of crisis to expedite justice\" (Martial Law Museum).\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY?\nHuman rights violations and extrajudicial killings are still on-going in the Philippines under President Bongbong Marcos, the son of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. who proclaimed Martial Law in 1972, and Vice President Sara Duterte, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte who spearheaded the violent War on Drugs in 2016 (Karapatan).\nWHY WOULD I WANT TO JOIN THE FILM SCREENING?\nThe film screening is for anyone who is keen to learn about the Martial Law Era, wants to share their experience during the Martial Law (or something similar) through group discussion, wants to meet new people, wants to watch a Philippine film/documentary, or just wants to have snacks.\nI WANT TO JOIN BUT I'M FROM T\u0100MAKI MAKAURAU / CHRISTCHURCH / THE PHILIPPINES.\nWe will stream the film through Zoom for viewers outside Te Whanganui-a-Tara, however, there may be internet and other technical difficulties during the event itself. Also please make sure to select the \"Online\" ticket option when RSVPing.\nHOW MUCH IS THE TICKET?\nThe film screening is free but we appreciate koha for the venue/snacks/donations to Philippine non-governmental organisations (NGOs).\nNOTE: This is an LGBTQ+ friendly event.",

But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection.

You can either select 'Daytime' or 'Evening' which will let you watch three features total. Daytime tickets are from 1:30pm until the dinner break (around 7:00pm). Evening are from the dinner break until the end of the last film.\n\nSurprise we are running a 35mm Mystery Marathon very soon! We have had some exciting news that we cannot share for now but as a result we must move our beautiful 35mm from its usual location into storage for a bit. We are not sure when it will be set back up so to celebrate we are running a marathon of six 35mm features across one Saturday!\n\nWe will kick off the first film at 1:30pm sharp on Saturday and will have a short dinner break after the third film. All going to plan we should be done by around 12:30am.\n\nIn terms of the features, we have films from the 1960s through to the early 2000s with a mix of comedies, sci-fi, horror and cult classics! Granted not all of these films would be considered masterpieces but there is nothing more fun than sitting in a crowd not knowing what could be coming next!\n\nWe will have a snack menu you can pre-order before the first film so aim to arrive around 1:00pm to order. The breaks between films will be very short (probably just enough time for the projectionist to thread up the next film) so make sure you come prepared for back-to-back screenings.\n\nThis event has strictly no digital projection, it\u2019s all film all the time. Now in theory it should all playback without a hitch as we are bringing in some of the best projectionist\u2019s Wellington has. But 35mm is a strange beast that can sometimes throw up the odd issue.\n\nFull marathon tickets (Admit) are $50\nHalf Marathon - Daytime are $30\nHalf Marathon - Evening are $30\n\nSeating is general admission and cinema entrance will be determined by earliest ticket purchase times.",

    "description": "NZIFF: Dreams (Sex Love), A teenage girl recounts her crush for her teacher through the pages of a memoir. The winner of the Golden Bear 2025 is a lucid and tender chronicle of the unforgettable experience of first love.\n\nOriginally intended as the second chapter in his trilogy and released in Norway as such, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Dreams ended up premiering internationally as the last. But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Raised in Barcelona by her maternal grandparents, Marina visits her paternal family in Galicia, in order to obtain the paternity recognition documents that would allow her to apply for a scholarship. Guided on her journey by the pages of her mother's diary, Marina revisits her parents\u2019 story of love and addiction...\n\nSim\u00f3n brushes with delicate touches the dynamics of a difficult family reconciliation and the motions of post-adolescent desire (the attraction between Marina and her cousin). While she initially draws from the tropes of summertime family dramas, Sim\u00f3n then turns Romer\u00eda into a dreamlike fable where the past comes alive through the present thanks to the simple, yet enchanting true magic of cinema.\u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

In the Val-d'Oise region, this community, originally from Turkey and Iraq, has lived since the 1980s in a rhythm marked by weddings, church services, and family meals.\nShaped by the exile of their parents and the persecution their community faced under the Turkish dictatorship and Daesh, S\u00e9miramis nurtures her roots in Assyrian civilization, originating from Mesopotamia. But the puzzle of her history no longer fits together as it once did.\nGradually, the elders are disappearing, taking with them an identity and culture that is 6,000 years old. How can this fracture be repaired, and this heritage preserved? Should they consider staying or returning to their ancestral homeland, now that peace has returned? Can one go back after decades of conflict? Can they rebuild and start anew to live in peace with themselves and others?\n\"Return to Babylon\" is a road movie from Sarcelles to Erbil, following S\u00e9miramis and her family on a journey that leads them to question their future in France and the fate of their community in the Middle East.\nA film by Marie Dault, S\u00e9miramis Ide, and S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nDirected by S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nScreen time: 52-minutes; French and Assyrian with subtitles\nLink to the English-subtitled trailer: https://www.instagram.com/p/DDzsYJzt_B9/\nThe screening event will be held at the Cockburn Street Chapel, 1 Cockburn Street, Kilbirnie, Wellington from 5-7pm.\n\nEntrance is free, but please register to confirm your attendance.\n\nWe welcome koha (donations) which will go towards supporting the ACEYA Wellington Branch's youth-focused activities and events.",

    "description": "Reels for Meals: Prime Minister, September's Reels for Meals movie fundraiser is Prime Minister.\nIn August 2017, in the lead-up to national elections, Jacinda Ardern unexpectedly became New Zealand\u2019s opposition party leader. She had just turned 37. Two frenetic months later, she was Prime Minister. Just before the final vote was in, she discovered she was pregnant. She would become only the second head of state in history to give birth while in office.\nArdern quickly became one of the most recognisable leaders in the world. She drew global attention from people craving a sensitive and compassionate approach to the critical issues of our time. In private, she struggled with being a mother and proving herself to a public skeptical of women\u2019s leadership. A series of crises - the Christchurch massacre, pandemic lockdowns, and disinformation-fueled protests outside Parliament - would test that leadership and the feminine touch she brought to it. She resigned from office in January 2023, shocking her supporters and critics alike.\nGoing behind the scenes of her administration and her private life, Prime Minister follows Jacinda for seven years as she is catapulted to the top of New Zealand politics, becomes a feminist political icon, resigns suddenly from office and continues to champion the fight against isolationism, fear, and the distortion of truth. Intimate home footage shot by her husband and audio interviews that Jacinda did while in office give us unparalleled access. Along with in-depth contemporaneous interviews, these form the emotional backbone of the story, giving viewers an unfiltered window into her years in power.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

    "description": "Breathwork: A Gentle Reset, Breathwork: A Gentle Reset\nBreathwork: A Gentle Reset\n\nTake a pause from the noise of daily life.\n\nThis breathwork journey begins with gentle movement to awaken the body and open the breath. Through slow, mindful stretches, we begin softening tension and grounding into the present.\n\nYou\u2019ll then be guided through two styles of breathwork \u2014 each offering a unique pathway inward. There\u2019s no pressure or expectation, just the freedom to explore what feels right for you:\n\nA dynamic, connected breath for those who wish to build energy, move emotion, or break through internal blockages\n\nA slow, rhythmic breath for those seeking stillness, calm, and deeper grounding\n\nBoth approaches invite a sense of spaciousness \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally \u2014 while supporting nervous system balance and inner clarity.\n\nTo gently close the session, we\u2019ll move into a quiet, nurturing meditation to support integration and leave you feeling steady, clear, and connected.\n\nAfterwards, stay and enjoy a nourishing plant-based dinner and dessert, lovingly prepared to complement the experience \u2014 because healing is also about how we feed and care for ourselves.\n\nWhy Breathwork?\n\nBreathwork has helped so many shift from a state of tension and overwhelm into a place of ease, clarity, and resilience \u2014 often after just one session. It\u2019s a simple, powerful practice that reconnects you to your body, your breath, and your inner stillness.\n\nYou\u2019ll leave feeling more grounded, more present, and more like yourself again.\n\nMeet Karla, your host\nKarla is a breathwork and trauma-somatic facilitator based in Aotearoa (New Zealand), originally from Malta. With over a decade of experience in Reiki and three years facilitating trauma-informed, science-based breathwork, Karla combines holistic tools, meditation, and conscious breathing to support nervous system regulation and deep emotional healing. Her offerings help release stored trauma, reduce stress and anxiety, and activate oxytocin\u2014the \u201clove hormone\u201d\u2014fostering connection, vitality, and a sense of wholeness. She currently holds regular classes, workshops, and transformative retreats that nurture the mind, body, and spirit.\n................................................................................................\n\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz\n\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing. It is not intended as therapy nor does it replace counselling, therapy, or any other medical or clinical professional help. Participants are guided to draw out where they are at, whilst drawing out their own inner resources for support and guidance.\nParticipants understand it is their own responsibility to manage their mental and physical health during sessions, to opt in and out of activities as they see fit, and make the facilitator aware if further support is required.",

Menus are created on the spot, and dishes are served to a buzzing, hungry crowd. It\u2019s fast-paced, creative chaos with serious culinary skills on display. Guests get a front-row seat to the action, while supporting a truly game-changing enterprise.\r\n\r\n4 August \u2014 Jessie Gibberd, Loretta\r\nOriginally from rural Waikato, Jessie Gibberd made the move to Wellington to study, but it was the buzz of hospitality that captured her heart. Swapping textbooks for tongs, she left her degree behind to dive headfirst into the kitchen. Now a chef de partie at Loretta, Jessie brings a grounded, fresh perspective to one of the city\u2019s most beloved eateries.\r\n\r\n11 August \u2014 Felipe Molina, El Matador\r\nHailing from Chile, Felipe Molina is a professional chef with over 15 years of experience in kitchens around the world. Having worked in several countries and world-class restaurants, Felipe brings a global sensibility to his craft.

From there, he headed to Queenstown, learning from a wide range of chefs and kitchen styles before challenging himself with a move to Wellington. Since then, he\u2019s worked at some of the city\u2019s top restaurants and now brings his thoughtful, evolving style to Graze Wine Bar.\r\n\r\n25 August \u2014 Lulu Temmuyin, Mr Go\u2019s\r\nLulu Temmuyin is a chef who loves pushing boundaries, even when they\u2019re unexpected.

Most props are provided but feel free to bring your own yoga mat for extra comfort as well as a cushion, blanket, socks and an eye pillow if you have one.\n\nThis class is suitable for all - no previous experience is required.\n\nLIMITED SPACES AVAILABLE.\nTWILIGHT SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/5a2pad44\nMORNING SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/mw82z38u\n\nRestorative yoga is a practice of deep relaxation in which yoga poses (asanas) are held for several minutes with the use of props such as blocks, bolster and blankets to support the body in gentle stretch.\n\nWhen your body enters a state of relaxation, your mind will also relax. Once you have been guided to let go of any tension held in your body, all that is required is for you to pay attention to your breath, becoming aware of any thoughts that may arise, and then gently releasing them.\n\nThis restful practice calms both mind and body, allowing the nervous system to enter its parasympathetic state \u2013 the state of \u201crest and digest\u201d, in which healing is enabled and enhanced.\n\nAbout Cacao\nCacao is a superfood. It is plant medicine at its finest. Its scientific name, Theobroma cacao, translates to \"food of the Gods.\" Containing many minerals, vitamins and phytonutrients such as flavonoids and antioxidants, it is also an extremely potent adaptogen that encourages the body to come into balance.\n\nCacao has a particularly strong influence on the heart \u2013 both physiologically and energetically. Cacao anecdotally is reported to enhance connection in community, hence its beauty in being shared in circle.\n\nIn Jenny's experience, cacao seems to enhance whatever it is that you are doing \u2013 be it running a marathon or meditating \u2013 cacao can make you go deeper, further, longer, stronger. However she does seem to have a mind of her own so be open to the experience she offers you \u2013 it may not always go quite how you planned!\n\nCacao is very safe and tolerated well by most people. However it is to be used with caution by people who are taking high doses of SSRIs. Cacao releases serotonin, so it works as a mild antidepressant. When taken with SSRIs that release serotonin chemically it can lead to serotonin syndrome. Individuals taking MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should avoid consuming ceremonial cacao due to potential interactions.\n\nThis workshop is part of Pukerua Bay Hub's 2025 Pop-up Parlour - thanks for your support.\n\n____________________________________\nWHAT IS THE POP-UP PARLOUR?\nA chance to create and connect in our pop-up community space.

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

    "description": "Book Launch - South by South by Charles Ferrall, Join us to celebrate the publication of Charles Ferrall's South by South: New Zealand and the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The book will be launched by Harry Ricketts.\n\n- Thursday 18 September, 6pm\n- Unity Books Wellington\n- Free event \u2013 all welcome!\n\nJoseph Kinsey is not a name many of us know \u2013 or not as well as we know the name Robert Falcon Scott. But from his base in Christchurch, Kinsey \u2013 book and art collector, philanthropist, science enthusiast, businessman \u2013 forged deep connections with the Antarctic expeditions and the explorers themselves through his tireless work as the agent for various expeditions. Two other New Zealanders also formed close friendships: Charles Bowen, a former politician, and Wellington lawyer Leonard Tripp, to whom Shackleton declared: \u2018I love you as David and Jonathan loved.\u2019\n\nSouth by South tells the story of New Zealand\u2019s role in \u2018the Heroic Age\u2019, that wave of exploration beginning at the end of the nineteenth century in which men set out to traverse the continent of Antarctica and, if they survived, to bring home their findings. The members of this New Zealander triumvirate were all believers in the British Empire, but the southern voyages were to an uninhabited land.\n\nSouth by South brings to light many letters, newspaper articles, and pieces of official correspondence, much of which has not been published before, during the five expeditions of 1901\u20131916: the Discovery, Nimrod, Terra Nova, Aurora, and Endurance. In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship. What they and the explorers wrote was influenced by nineteenth-century adventure stories which conveyed the Imperialist ideals of the time. If the impending conflict of 1914\u201318 was a very \u2018literary war\u2019, this was a very literary exploration.\n\nCharles Ferrall is an associate professor at Te Herenga Waka\u2013Victoria University of Wellington. Among his books are Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics (2001); The Trials of Eric Mareo (2002), co-written with Rebecca Ellis; East by South: China in the Australasian Imagination (2006), co-edited with Paul Millar and Keren Smith; Juvenile Literature and British Society 1850\u20131950 (2009), co-written with Anna Jackson; Henry Lawson in New Zealand (2012); How We Remember: New Zealanders and the First World War (2014), co-edited with Harry Ricketts; and Remembering Gallipoli: Interviews with New Zealand Gallipoli Veterans (2015), co-edited with Christopher Pugsley.\n\nCover photograph: The ship Discovery leaving Lyttelton Harbour, 1901.

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Porirua will show you how.  \nMost Porirua homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nPorirua has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country.

Since then, he has been creating spaces that invite honesty, vulnerability, and depth \u2014 guiding people into experiences of being truly seen and heard. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and breathwork facilitator, Andre brings creativity and presence to all his offerings, inspired by the question of what it really means to be human.\n................................................................................................\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

    "description": "Exploring our shared humanity, Join experienced psychotherapist Rohit Grover for a six-week course that invites you to look beyond the surface of everyday life. In these two-hour sessions, we will explore the core tenets of existential therapy, moving away from the conventional focus on self and hedonism. Instead, we'll grapple with life's big questions:\nWhat does it truly mean to live a value-driven life?\nDo our personal values matter, or is the search for meaning just an illusion?\nWhat is the \"being\" part of \"human being\" all about?\nThrough guided discussions, reflective exercises, and insights from classic existential thinkers, Rohit will help you navigate this profound territory. This isn't about finding easy answers. It's about developing the courage to ask the right questions, to confront the realities of freedom, responsibility, and meaning, and to discover a more authentic way of living.\nThis course is for anyone ready to step off the treadmill and begin a deeper exploration of what it means to be alive. Come and find out what it means to truly exist\nUpon completion of this course, participants will be able to:\nDifferentiate between a life driven by external pressures or fleeting pleasures and one rooted in personal values and authentic meaning.\nIdentify and critically examine the core existential givens of human existence, such as freedom, responsibility, isolation, and the search for meaning.\nArticulate a personal understanding of what it means to \"be\" a human being, moving beyond a purely functional or biological definition.\nArrive at sensing rather than thinking. Sensing this existence, this dance of life. Widen your view of existence.\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".",

He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives.

    "description": "Teaching Well - A supportive school for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), Growing attention to staff wellbeing has resulted in many workplace mental wellbeing initiatives. Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 20% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions. Post workshop consulting services such as mentoring the development of or reviewing a staff wellbeing plan can also be provided.\nPost Workshop Consult:\nSchools and Kuras have the option of a 90 minute consult with Barry in 2026 to review their staff wellbeing plan.\nAN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNING WITH INTERNATIONALLY RESPECTED AND AWARD WINNING MENTAL WELLBEING PRACTITIONER AND SUICIDOLOGIST, BARRY TAYLOR\nBarry has worked in mental wellbeing promotion and suicide prevention/postvention for 37 years at the local, national and international levels.  His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs.  He has worked extensively with schools both here and overseas supporting management and staff in the event of a suicide. He wrote the first suicide postvention guidelines for schools in 1990, developed the first national suicide prevention guidelines for schools in Australia in 1999 and reviewed and updated the NZ guidelines in 2010.\nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.  In recognition of his outstanding contribution to mental wellbeing and suicide prevention, he was awarded in 2016 the NSW Mental Health Commissioner's Community Champion Award.\nBarry has lectured on wellbeing both nationally and internationally and been appointed to numerous government advisory committees on mental wellbeing and suicide prevention.  He brings to this workshop extensive experience in advising communities and government on post-disaster recovery in terms of both mental wellbeing promotion / community resiliency and suicide prevention.\nAs a Health Sociologist and Public Health practitioner, Barry has a long-term interest in the social and cultural determinants of wellbeing, especially the role of gender and he brings a wealth of knowledge and passion for promoting wellbeing in men. He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing. He uses a population health and systems change approach, drawing on transformational change theory and collective impact.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to promote well wh\u0101nau, workplaces and communities and for the incorporation of wellbeing principles in public policy and social outcomes such as education, training and employment.\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

When triggered, these unconscious \u201cprograms\u201d hijack our reactions, leaving us feeling stuck even when we want to move forward.

As a mind technician trained in eutaptics (Faster EFT), she employs the fastest and most powerful method to create lasting change by addressing the root causes of issues rather than just the symptoms.

Once you have been guided to let go of any tension held in your body, all that is required is for you to pay attention to your breath, becoming aware of any thoughts that may arise, and then gently releasing them.\n\nThis restful practice calms both mind and body, allowing the nervous system to enter its parasympathetic state \u2013 the state of \u201crest and digest\u201d, in which healing is enabled and enhanced.\n\nAbout Cacao\nCacao is a superfood. It is plant medicine at its finest. Its scientific name, Theobroma cacao, translates to \"food of the Gods.\" Containing many minerals, vitamins and phytonutrients such as flavonoids and antioxidants, it is also an extremely potent adaptogen that encourages the body to come into balance.\n\nCacao has a particularly strong influence on the heart \u2013 both physiologically and energetically. Cacao anecdotally is reported to enhance connection in community, hence its beauty in being shared in circle.\n\nIn Jenny's experience, cacao seems to enhance whatever it is that you are doing \u2013 be it running a marathon or meditating \u2013 cacao can make you go deeper, further, longer, stronger. However she does seem to have a mind of her own so be open to the experience she offers you \u2013 it may not always go quite how you planned!\n\nCacao is very safe and tolerated well by most people. However it is to be used with caution by people who are taking high doses of SSRIs. Cacao releases serotonin, so it works as a mild antidepressant. When taken with SSRIs that release serotonin chemically it can lead to serotonin syndrome. Individuals taking MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should avoid consuming ceremonial cacao due to potential interactions.\n\nThis workshop is part of Pukerua Bay Hub's 2025 Pop-up Parlour - thanks for your support.\n\n____________________________________\nWHAT IS THE POP-UP PARLOUR?\nA chance to create and connect in our pop-up community space. From 1-30 September we've got a jam-packed schedule with 65+ events for kids, families, rangatahi and adults to learn, hang out and have fun.\n\nCheck out all the free/koha events too -\nhttps://www.pkbhub.org.nz/whatson\n\nWaiho i te toipoto, kaua i te toi roa \u2013\nLet us keep close together, not far apart.\n\n",

They change fast, they don\u2019t always play nice, and they\u2019ve caught out even the most experienced skippers. Each year, we see serious incidents and tragedies happening on our bars, so it\u2019s super important to know your stuff before you head out.\nThat\u2019s where we come in. Join us at Manawatu Marine Boating Club for a free and relaxed seminar. You\u2019ll hear straight from local Coastguard skippers and boating legends who\u2019ll share their real-world tips, local knowledge, and a few stories from the water.\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover (and chat about):\n\nUnderstanding the local features of your bar\nReading and interpreting the conditions when planning a trip\nGetting your boat and your crew bar crossing ready\nHow to handle your boat while crossing\nHow to do a bar crossing report (and why it\u2019s worth it)\nWhat to do if things go pear-shaped\nIt\u2019s interactive \u2013 so bring your questions, share your own experiences, and have a yarn with others in the boating community.\nBring your mates too \u2013 whether they\u2019re brand new to boating or have been around since the days of paper charts and handheld compasses, there\u2019s something in here that could save a trip\u2026 or a life.\n Why it matters:\nIn 2024, 23% of craft-related drownings happened during bar crossings.\n5 lives were lost due to capsizing while crossing a bar.\nOlder blokes are still the most at-risk \u2013 but everyone can make safer choices with the right knowledge (and a lifejacket on).",

    "description": "Book Club: Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",

At Wellington Classic Literature Group we read novels that have stood the test of time, whether they were written in 1780, 1880 or even 1980. The group has been running for more than a decade and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers that come along for particular books or simply when it suits.

The work changed American hearts and minds about slavery.\n\nThe influence of Uncle Tom's Cabin was so immense that the story arose that when Abraham Lincoln welcomed Stowe to the White House during the American Civil War he reportedly declared, \"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\"\n\nIn the US, it was the best-selling novel of the 19th century and the second best-selling book of all after the Bible.\n\nProject Gutenberg link for those e-reading:\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/203\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place.

    "description": "Jewellery-making in 4 weeks on Sundays, Mixed levels - Wellington, This Sunday afternoon block is a short course on jewellery-making. It starts on Sun 24 August and runs for 4 weeks until Sun 14 September, 2pm - 5pm.\nBeginners will practice the basic techniques in copper or brass and then move on to working in silver. An excellent first project for beginners in this class is to create a simple textured ring band - but once you have the basics down, it is fun to create earrings, pendants or other simple items. Learning to cut, heat, form and texture metal - to solder using a jeweller's torch and silver solder, and finally to polish your work up to a beautiful finish: these classes are super satisfying.\nThese blocks are also a nice way for existing students or more advanced makers to work on more challenging projects and join friendly classes in our well-equipped warm studio!\nBasic materials are supplied and there are extra materials available to purchase as you need in class.\nThis block is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. NOTE: Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.\nOur booking system asks for full payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time please email us to arrange this\nCourse fee $280, Early bird pricing $252 till 27 July. ",

These works reflect a compositional approach shaped by both the harmonic and improvisational sensibilities of contemporary jazz pianists such as Brad Mehldau, Robert Glasper, and Aaron Parks, and the rhythmic, melodic, and resonant qualities of indigenous Samoan music, drawn from my own cultural heritage. This synthesis seeks to articulate a distinctly Pasifika jazz sound. This performance marks the live debut of the full suite of compositions, which have been recorded and are set to be released later this year.",

The tent is lovely during the day, but as it gets dark, it takes on a magical feeling. Fairy lights and crystals lit by gently changing coloured lights. We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle. Arniya then dances the energy in with Celestial Energy Movement, for the group. This creates a vortex of Divine power into the middle of the tent. Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\n",

Mana is of course a sanctuary so you must check your boats for any wildlife especially ants that may have gotten in past the hatches.

Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".\n\n1 Day\nPresented by Paul and Mary-Ellen Gadd.",

    "description": "Dear Gentlemen (Colombia), Dear Gentlemen (Colombia)\nDirector: Patricia Casta\u00f1eda -\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nAbout this Event\n\nDear Gentlemen brings to light the little-known sufraggist movement in Colombia. Set in 1954, the film follows Esmeralda Arboleda, a fiercely intelligent leader who sparks a revolution in a society deeply rooted in patriarchal traditions - a revolution that culminates in a fierce and decisve debate. A women group embarks on a historic struggle to bring the issue of women's right to vote before the National Constituent Assembly. With bold marches, radio appearances, and a brilliant media strategy that puts them on the front page, they achieve their goal, but the real challenge begins during the debate, where they face fierce opposition. Esmeralda Arboleda must endure personal attacks from the assembly members, and just as she is about to speak, she receives a heartbreaking call: her son has suffered a serious accident. She is torn between her duty as a mother and her commitment to the cause, with an unfavorable outcome. Although all seems to be lost, her perseverance leads to a historic victory when women's suffrage is finally approved, marking a turning point in Colombia's history.\n\n",

The Orchestra is a national trailblazer in big band history and features New Zealand compositions, and a classic repertoire from the golden era of big band swing jazz of Ellington and Basie.\n\nThe band benefits from a depth of talent that most military bands around the world would only dream of and is made up of Wellington\u2019s most exceptional musicians.\n\n\u201cThe line-up will be a who\u2019s who of the Wellington jazz scene,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s a while since we had a big band at the festival, so we\u2019re elated to have the Airforce Jazz Orchestra back with us again.

A smoky, dimly lit room where the anticipation is electric but the vibe is laid-back and relaxed. . .\n\nFrom the stage a jazz swing and blues band begins to play, their instruments blending seamlessly in a harmonious symphony of sound. The rhythm section, with its upright bass and snare drums, lays down a groove that's impossible to resist, while the saxophone punctuates the air with soulful notes.\n\nAt. the forefront stands a captivating female singer, her voice rich and velvety, weaving tales of heartache, joy, and everything in between. Her vocal prowess brings both swing and blues to life, effortlessly moving from sultry, slow blues ballads to energetic, foot-tapping swing numbers.\n\nThis band doesn't just play music; they create an experience that transports the audience to another era, where the essence of jazz and blues reigns supreme.\n\nWelcome to an evening of superb swing jazz and blues brought to you by the band that is April\u2019s Fools. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely wrapt to be bringing this ultra-talented and experienced combo to the festival,\u201d says Music Director Lee Quayle. \u201cWhenever, and wherever this group of musicians have played reviewers have to search the thesaurus for new superlatives to describe the show, and audiences leave reluctantly, but happy.\u201d\n\nApril\u2019s Fools are April Phillips (vocals), Greg Crayford (drums), Zak Dikvert (guitar), Nicholas Bauke-Maunsell (saxophone), Miles Crayford (keyboards) and RoryMacartney (bass).

    "description": "Altared States | Electronic Soundscapes in a Divine Place, Wellington\u2019s iconic Old St Paul\u2019s will play host to a transcendent new series in August, partnering with the Pyramid Club to present Altared States, a unique electronic music experience.\nSet beneath the exquisite stained-glass windows of one of Te Whanganui-a-Tara\u2019s most exquisite landmarks, this series promises an immersive sonic experience that invites audiences to explore sound in a deeply personal and transformative way.\nAltared States is inspired by Brian Sweeney\u2019s New York-founded Ambient Church, an initiative dedicated to collaborating with artists to create transformative audio performances in architecturally significant spaces. This series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\nEach of the evenings will bring a different electronic vibe, conjured by some of Wellington\u2019s most innovative artists. The series lineup includes:\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\nTickets are available from Wednesday 18 June, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\nAbout the Artists\nLudus\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\nStephen Gallagher\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\nDavid Long\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\nJules Desmond\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\nOghum\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\nJess Chambers\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration.

The pair met at the Elam School of Fine Arts. Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995. Wendyhouse output has been somewhat sporadic ever since, but with EE monk\u2019s recent return, the pair have returned to performing live.\n\nWendyhouse music was initially played on toy musical instruments, the kind that fit inside a Wendy house. Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\n\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo. Guitar, toy keyboard and vocals are the Wendyhouse instruments of choice.\n\n---\n\n\nDSLB\n\nDSLB is the solo project of Chrissie Butler (the shouty bass playing half of the now sleeping duo, mr sterile Assembly). An offshoot from Chrissie's other band Ditzy Squall, DSLB (Ditzy Squall's Lunch Box) is a showcase for a love of long endings and the hum things make when you hold them close to your ear. Performed live, DSLB is an improvised mash-up of ancient record players, purring keyboards, kitchen utensils and found objects. Soundtracks for short films and hand drawn comics are also residents in the lunch box. Recordings are released by skirted Records.\n\nhttps://skirtedrecords.com/dslb/\n\n---\n\nvegetable.machine.animal\n\nNew solo project courtesy of Mr Sterile, in which living fungal and plantlife inform a modular synthesiser with biofeedback.

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

But when the cancer returned in early 2025, she felt compelled to finish and release the album, not just as a legacy project, also as a celebration after hard times, with a focus on how \u201cyou can find the wonder in life, even in your backyard.\u201d\n\nA lifelong creative, Rivers records, mixes, and produces in her home studio in Masterton, and plays every instrument heard on The Backyard Wonder.

His voice, reserved, yet soulful and resonant along with his sympathetic guitar chops, elevate Celine\u2019s and other songs to new and sometimes surprising places.

Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh.

    "description": "Greg Crayford's Jazz Night - Twenty Year Anniversary!, Twenty years! Yep, you read that right. This residency has run for two solid decades.\nGreg Crayford here. Host and drummer of what\u2019s been billed for some time now as Wellington\u2019s Longest-Running Jazz Residency. And rightly so! Little could we have known when this gig began at The Realm in Hataitai in August 2005 that it\u2019d still be going in 2025. It\u2019s a fantastic achievement. Longer residencies have occurred in our town but nothing currently running holds a candle to that sort of effort by a single artist, at a single venue, in this town (and possibly beyond).\nWe boast quite the legacy: two Tui-nominated live albums, several bar owners, many managers and staff, hundreds of featured professional musicians and young artists, 500-odd gigs, uncountable numbers of pizzas, beer, whisky, and much laughter and joy. From local music students to top-notch international artists we\u2019ve seen it all.\nIt\u2019s a huge milestone - 20 years of high quality music played by a massive variety of talented people.\nThe exciting programme is largely finalised and is pasted below.\nMark the date!\nTable bookings 04 974 2207 or info.therealm@nzvenueco.nz or therealm.co.nz and click on \u2018book a table\u2019\nGreat ambience, good company, superb kai and stellar music.

She has played with musicians such as Yo-yo Ma, Whirimako Black, and Marlon Williams, as well as composed for small group and orchestra such as the Auckland Philharmonia. Ruby is currently working on a book exploring the use of taonga p\u016boro in hauora, which was the focus of her PhD in Public Health.\n\nhttps://rubysolly.bandcamp.com/album/p-neke\n\n-\n\nTom Callwood (double bass) is an improvisor and collaborator who has performed throughout NZ and the UK. He\u2019s a regular in the local experimental and popular music scenes with bands including The Phoenix Foundation, Teeth & Devils Gate Outfit.\n\n-\n\nAndy Wright - Fueled by the Exploration of non verbal shifting time space vector energy zones, Andy is a multidisciplinary visual artist, drummer, keyboardist and regular log on the fire of improv at the Pyramid Club.\n\n-\n\nDaniel Beban is a musician and sound artist who performs on a number of different instruments and builds sound sculptures and invented instruments out of found objects and recycled materials.\n\n-\n\nIsaac Smith is a bassist who also works with electronics. After spending several years in Columbo and Sri Lanka, Isaac is currently based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Isaac has a strong commitment to improvisation as a vehicle in the pursuit of awareness and balance.\n\n\n$17.50 presales available via UTR\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

The group is now actively\nworking towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\nRomi Wrights\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring\nstories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke\nfestival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release\nmid to late 2025.\n\n",

The Orchestra is a national trailblazer in big band history and features New Zealand compositions, and a classic repertoire from the golden era of big band swing jazz of Ellington and Basie.\n\nThe band benefits from a depth of talent that most military bands around the world would only dream of and is made up of Wellington\u2019s most exceptional musicians.\n\n\u201cThe line-up will be a who\u2019s who of the Wellington jazz scene,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s a while since we had a big band at the festival, so we\u2019re elated to have the Airforce Jazz Orchestra back with us again. They last played at the festival in 2014. Many of the band members have been here since, but not as part of a big band,\u201d says Lee.\n\nBe Transported by April\u2019s Fools\nImagine stepping back in time to a speak easy club. A smoky, dimly lit room where the anticipation is electric but the vibe is laid-back and relaxed. . .\n\nFrom the stage a jazz swing and blues band begins to play, their instruments blending seamlessly in a harmonious symphony of sound. The rhythm section, with its upright bass and snare drums, lays down a groove that's impossible to resist, while the saxophone punctuates the air with soulful notes.\n\nAt. the forefront stands a captivating female singer, her voice rich and velvety, weaving tales of heartache, joy, and everything in between. Her vocal prowess brings both swing and blues to life, effortlessly moving from sultry, slow blues ballads to energetic, foot-tapping swing numbers.\n\nThis band doesn't just play music; they create an experience that transports the audience to another era, where the essence of jazz and blues reigns supreme.\n\nWelcome to an evening of superb swing jazz and blues brought to you by the band that is April\u2019s Fools. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely wrapt to be bringing this ultra-talented and experienced combo to the festival,\u201d says Music Director Lee Quayle. \u201cWhenever, and wherever this group of musicians have played reviewers have to search the thesaurus for new superlatives to describe the show, and audiences leave reluctantly, but happy.\u201d\n\nApril\u2019s Fools are April Phillips (vocals), Greg Crayford (drums), Zak Dikvert (guitar), Nicholas Bauke-Maunsell (saxophone), Miles Crayford (keyboards) and RoryMacartney (bass). They will be playing at Jazz in Martinborough on Friday 5 September 2025 as the opening of the ticketed festival gigs to be held in the Town Hall.",

Sticking to the traditional one man band format, Chuck plays all the instruments simultaneously.\nCaptivating storytelling intertwines effortlessly with heart stopping harmonica. Multiple guitar styles are underpinned by his left and right feet frantically pounding the kick and hi hat. The listener is left simply wondering, \"How the hell does he do that\"?\nOriginally hailing from the UK, Li\u2019l Chuck has been stomping his music in NZ since 2003.\nLi'l Chuck has performed at many high profile events around New Zealand including opening for American legend Jimmy Buffet, Bluesman Jerron 'Blind Boy' Paxton and The Topp Twins, and festivals including Blues on Broadbeach, Gold Coast Australia, Dunedin and Wanaka Arts festivals, The Great Kiwi Beer festival, Canterbury folk festival and many more.\nUp to 2025, He has recorded 5 solo one man band records to great acclaim by international Blues publications.\nHis 2017 album Utility Blues hit No\u20196 on the official NZ albums chart & has twice been the feature artist on Jesse Mulligan's Radio New Zealand\u2019s Friday live.\nIn an age where we are rushing around at breakneck speed, where everything is instant, sugar coated, airbrushed and overly polished, Li\u2019l Chuck brings us down to earth with some organic, all natural, whole grain, naked goodness.\nDoors open 7pm for a 7.30pm start.",

    "description": "Make Some Noise - choral music that matters, After a successful performance of Mozart\u2019s classic Requiem in D Minor in May, Supertonic is back with a programme of contemporary choral music that matters. \nOn the evening of Saturday 8 November, Supertonic will present Make Some Noise at the Lower Hutt Town Hall. This is the first time the choir has performed in the Hutt Valley, and they hope to see some new faces in the audience as they bring this programme of  meaningful music from around the world to the stage.  \nMake Some Noise highlights issues of social justice, including indigenous, women\u2019s and civil rights and climate action. The programme is rich and varied, from Katerina Gimon\u2019s arrangement of AURORA\u2019s Apple Tree, a Norwegian pop song addressing the urgency of the global climate crisis, to Robert T. Gibson\u2019s arrangement of the gospel standard This Little Light of Mine. Oliassa by Malika Tirolien utilises an invented language to invoke a call from the ancestors, while Alex Vollant titles their piece Auass meaning \u201cchild\u201d in the Innu language to honour the generation of elders who survived the Residential Schools in Canada. The impact of sexual harassment and assault on women is highlighted in MILCK\u2019s I Can\u2019t Keep Quiet  and Lillia Ruocco and Emmanuelle Ader\u2019s Canzone r\u00f2 curtiell\u2019. Closer to home, Make Some Noise features a set of waiata in teo reo M\u0101ori to highlight the importance of indigenous voices in Aotearoa New Zealand, including Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s Whakarongo. This waiata-\u0101-ringa incorporates Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s beliefs and methodology on teaching te reo M\u0101ori.   \nLed by co-Musical Director Virginie Pacheco, Supertonic offers Make Some Noise as an invitation to concert-goers to consider the causes that are important to them. In connecting with audiences through the striking and impactful works of the composers featured in this programme - by turns harmonious, raucous, gut-wrenching, resolute - the choir hopes to inspire those listening to make some noise in their own lives. \nSupertonic was formed in 2014 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and strives to  push the boundaries of what choral music can be. The choir has performed concerts that cover the entire musical spectrum, from major classical works including Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Vivaldi's Gloria and Faure's Requiem to pop and rock spectaculars celebrating hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s from the likes of Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Elton John, Queen, and Celine Dion. The choir has performed alongside The Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, joined Brett McKenzie, the NZSO and The Muppets for the Jim Henson Retrospectacle,  shared the stage with Mama Kin Spender at Coastella, and performed in national civic commemorations, street festivals and at community events.",

    "description": "Make Some Noise - choral music that matters, After a successful performance of Mozart\u2019s classic Requiem in D Minor in May, Supertonic is back with a programme of contemporary choral music that matters. \nOn the evening of Saturday 8 November, Supertonic will present Make Some Noise at the Lower Hutt Town Hall. This is the first time the choir has performed in the Hutt Valley, and they hope to see some new faces in the audience as they bring this programme of  meaningful music from around the world to the stage.  \nMake Some Noise highlights issues of social justice, including indigenous, women\u2019s and civil rights and climate action. The programme is rich and varied, from Katerina Gimon\u2019s arrangement of AURORA\u2019s Apple Tree, a Norwegian pop song addressing the urgency of the global climate crisis, to Robert T. Gibson\u2019s arrangement of the gospel standard This Little Light of Mine. Oliassa by Malika Tirolien utilises an invented language to invoke a call from the ancestors, while Alex Vollant titles their piece Auass meaning \u201cchild\u201d in the Innu language to honour the generation of elders who survived the Residential Schools in Canada. The impact of sexual harassment and assault on women is highlighted in MILCK\u2019s I Can\u2019t Keep Quiet  and Lillia Ruocco and Emmanuelle Ader\u2019s Canzone r\u00f2 curtiell\u2019. Closer to home, Make Some Noise features a set of waiata in teo reo M\u0101ori to highlight the importance of indigenous voices in Aotearoa New Zealand, including Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s Whakarongo. This waiata-\u0101-ringa incorporates Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s beliefs and methodology on teaching te reo M\u0101ori.   \nLed by co-Musical Director Virginie Pacheco, Supertonic offers Make Some Noise as an invitation to concert-goers to consider the causes that are important to them. In connecting with audiences through the striking and impactful works of the composers featured in this programme - by turns harmonious, raucous, gut-wrenching, resolute - the choir hopes to inspire those listening to make some noise in their own lives. \nSupertonic was formed in 2014 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and strives to  push the boundaries of what choral music can be. The choir has performed concerts that cover the entire musical spectrum, from major classical works including Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Vivaldi's Gloria and Faure's Requiem to pop and rock spectaculars celebrating hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s from the likes of Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Elton John, Queen, and Celine Dion. The choir has performed alongside The Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, joined Brett McKenzie, the NZSO and The Muppets for the Jim Henson Retrospectacle,  shared the stage with Mama Kin Spender at Coastella, and performed in national civic commemorations, street festivals and at community events.",

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nMercy Lie:\n\nDriving all night under the stars, along the highways of human experience, the original songs of Mercy Lie will haunt, surprise, remind and affirm.\n\nMercy Lie is the musical guise of Laura Chester-Murphy. An instinctive sound maker from an early age, Laura just wants to keep the music rolling. There\u2019s a lot of sound from that little acoustic guitar and a voice to match. In the songs, you will find fierce independence, crushing vulnerability and a reflective wit that speaks to a life of figuring stuff out along the way.\n\nWith influences ranging across and not limited to folk, funk, country, goth, indie and 90\u2019s rave, Laura puts the focus on crafting percussive earworms that won\u2019t leave your head easily. The music of Mercy Lie is a unique soundscape, sculpted with ambience and depth, the silence unforgettably painted by explorations into the motivations of both the self and fellow travellers.\n\nMercy Lie is about connecting over the foibles of polite society and the ways we are wired to weave around each other.\n\nHometowns, journeys, mysteries, ghosts, growing up, messing up, speaking out, moving on. If you like getting nostalgic over something and nothing all at once, buckle up.\n\n\u201cMercy Lie\u2019s novel approach to the guitar and talent for songwriting make for the perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that voice to come from that mouth.\u201d\n\u201cAn acoustic delight!\u201d\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience. As she continues to evolve as an artist, Araiyah\u2019s music promises to touch the hearts of many, leaving a lasting impact on all who have the privilege of listening.\n\nAraiyah will be accompanied by guitarist Izzy and Laura Chester-Murphy on percussion.\n\nRain and the Urban Bohemians:\n\nFormed around the music of singer-songwriter Cathy Elizabeth aka Rain, supported by her band of Urban Bohemians, this group has been able to weave together many different influences and styles to create something quite unique and beautiful.\n\nPeppered with contemplations of our existence and the fleetingness of time, Rain & the UBs bring the magic with a folk-rock edge and an alluring authenticity at its centre. Spiritual undertones and overtones give way to an uplifting joyfulness, of triumph over difficulties and life lessons learned and expressed through music.\n\nWith Cathy Elizabeth on vocals & acoustic guitar, Chris Ewers on bass, Murray James on drums and Izzy and Dion on guitars, these guys have got the goods and are ready to deliver!\n\nSo come along and allow yourself to be immersed and transported, moved and entertained. It\u2019s going to be a very special night all round!\n\n",

With a deep adoration for Pacific musical reference points and a desire to explore new sonic ground, LEAO synthesises non-traditional tonalities with a fa\u2018asamoa spirit, creating what some have called \u201cniu wave\u201d and \u201cPacific neo-psychedelia.\u201d A creative enigma and phenomenal live act since the release of their critically acclaimed debut GHOST ROADS in 2019, LEAO has continued to expand its vision with the 2024 single TAEAO / MEA UMA - a sparkling glimpse into a significant body of alternative Pacific music currently in development. The group is now actively working towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\n\nRomi Wrights\n\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring stories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke festival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release mid to late 2025.",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\n\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.\n\n",

With a string of releases on Berlin-based PHTM, T\u0101maki Makaurau-based Gypnotica, and an impressive catalog of self-releases, he consistently showcases his singular and original interpretation of dance music.\n\nInstagram.com/e.li\nelihoff.bandcamp.com\nabyssalsoundworks.bandcamp.com\n\n\nHUNTER \u2014 Hang the Saints / Haven\n\nRaised in Kaik\u014dura, Aotearoa, Hunter's dark and atmospheric sound often contrasts the beautiful environment she grew up in. Her direct approach to techno draws influence from heavy percussion, bold rhythm and industrial soundscapes. After spending two years finding inspiration in clubs overseas, she has returned to \u014ctautahi with a refined style that\u2019s ready to make people dance. As the co-founder of \u201cHang The Saints\u201d and resident of \u201cHaven\u201d, Hunter is all about creating safe, inclusive spaces for people to connect through the music she loves.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sspoonsnake/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hunter-mccrory-334790608\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/bC3qeA6pUxBoMo7P9\n\n\nLUDUS & RIZZO \u2014 Tonic Collective\n\nTonic Collective is the recent endeavour of Ludus and Rizzo, inspired by the people, places and spaces of their experience touring China with BIRDPARTY and Vera Ellen. Both acts are individually known for their versatile and innovative sound, bringing a wide range of influences and inspirations to the dancefloor. In the short time since establishing the collective, they\u2019ve already hosted Kaishandao and Bone Chapel, established a space, and debuted a monthly radio show on Mouthfull that explores sound from across the genre spectrum, both in the club and out.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ludus.etc/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alicerizzoofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tonic.collective/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/l-s-rizzo/416life-support-cl1n1c-chengdu\nhttps://soundcloud.com/racquetclub-info/mix-series-016-ludus\n\n\nSHLI \u2014 Echo Train Records / Warehouse Rave / Holding Hands\n\nShli is the alias of \u014ctautahi-via-P\u014dneke DJ and Producer Tim Ward. Steadily releasing works over recent years through local labels like Echo Train and the Big Fresh Collective, he is carving out a sound of his own.\n\nStitching together infectious rhythms layered over low-end pressure, Shli\u2019s sets draw influence from across the hardcore continuum and beyond.

They can be found on Instagram at @thesameerproject.\nMore information:\nJenin Jenin includes testimony from Jenin residents after the Israeli army\u2019s Defensive Shield operation, during which the city and camp were the scenes of fierce fighting. The operation ended with Jenin flattened and scores of Palestinians killed. Palestinians as well as numerous human rights groups accused Israel of committing war crimes in the April 2002 attack on the refugee camp. The sad question forces itself on the spectator: What will become of a country, a people when its children are confronted with war and violence from a very early age?",

It was a huge success, with over 250 audience members and 52 artists over our four sessions. Audiences were raving about the musical variety and great talent they found at the Racket Lounge, and as one audience member commented; \u201cWell done\u2026do it again!\u201d So, we listened, and the Racket Lounge is back for round two!

    "description": "The Beatniks x IVY - NZ Tour 2025 - Wellington, \u2018IVY\u2019 and \u2018The Beatniks\u2019, two of the biggest independent artists coming out of \u014ctepoti, are both known for their highly-captivating live performances. Melancholic in one instance, and packed full of noisy energy the next - now geared up with new material to showcase, the art-rock and surf-punk stylings of each of these young acts are tighter than ever.\n\u2018IVY\u2019 are held in the highest of regards when it comes to emerging kiwi artists. Nestling within the realm of dark and brooding tones, and immense, layered chorus, IVY know how to deliver a powerful and emotionally-resonant set; their sharp growth has quickly turned heads nationwide. From appearing on festival lineups such as Snow machine and OUSA Ori, playing with the Dunedin Youth Orchestra, and earning the SRN 2024 People\u2019s Choice Award, IVY are ready to take their breathtaking art-rock performance around Aotearoa for the first time.\n\u2018The Beatniks\u2019 have been playing together since 2021, and have quickly become a \u2018must-see\u2019 live act within Aotearoa. After playing large-scale festivals last year, such as Rhythm & Alps, their recent release has delivered a more mature sound. Yet still soaked in their signature surf-grunge style. Having not toured the North Island since their debut album \u2018Archetype\u2019 in 2023, they\u2019re ready to show you a whole new layer of alt-rock spirit on the stage.\n\nSET TIMES:\n7pm - Doors Open\n7:30pm - Half/Angel\n8:30pm - IVY\n9:50pm - The Beatniks ",

Temporal Aria is a breathtaking contemporary circus experience that fuses the ancient art of hair suspension with acrobatics to explore the profound tension between control and surrender.\nInspired by performer Nicole Maisey\u2019s recent ADHD diagnosis, the show becomes a deeply personal exploration of distractibility, executive dysfunction, and the pursuit of inner peace. Through feats of extraordinary strength and vulnerability, Nicole transforms struggle into artistry, expressing a journey toward balance and self-acceptance.\nAt its heart, Temporal Aria is about learning to release control and accept support, a powerful shift from isolation to connection. As Nicole navigates the physical and emotional extremes of her art, she discovers that surrender is not weakness, but a pathway to strength, resilience, and unexpected grace.\nSet to a mesmerizing soundscape, Temporal Aria is both a spectacle and a meditation. a poetic intersection of circus, emotion, and identity. It\u2019s not just about the act of letting go, but about what we discover in the process: joy, contentment, and the redefinition of success as peace within.\nPrepare to be captivated by a performance that truly takes your breath away.\n\n",

When we connect to our inner foundations, we touch the support of those who came before and deepen our sense of belonging to life itself.\nWe\u2019ll begin with ceremonial cacao, then drop into a guided movement journey with live soundscape. There are no steps to learn, no performance\u2014just presence, curiosity, and letting your body move as it feels. Barefoot and phone-free, you\u2019re invited to drop deep into free-form movement, awakening parts of you that you may have forgotten.\nCome as you are.\nMove with what you feel.\nLeave feeling empowered, connected, and alive.\nSomatic dance is a guided movement practice that helps you tune into your body\u2019s wisdom and move from the inside out. Unlike ecstatic dance, which is typically an open, DJ-led space with no facilitation, somatic dance offers gentle guidance to support you in exploring sensation, emotion, and embodiment in a safe, intentional way. You\u2019re not learning steps or performing\u2014you're being invited into presence, curiosity, and feeling. With a focus on nervous system regulation, personal expression, and inner listening, somatic dance creates a nurturing space to come home to yourself.\nYour Hosts...\nJenna Joan | Embodiment Facilitator\nJenna Joan is a somatic therapist, yoga teacher, and group facilitator who has been leading movement spaces for over 15 years. With a background in yoga, somatic dance, and therapeutic embodiment, her work blends play, authenticity, and deep nervous system awareness. Jenna is also a cacao alchemist and ceremonial facilitator, known for creating safe, soulful spaces that invite freedom, connection, and inner exploration. She has been hosting workshops, retreats, and community events for nearly a decade, and also works 1:1 in more therapeutic settings.\nSonic Sutra | Somatic Dance DJ\nSonic Sutra is a sound artist and somatic dance DJ who creates immersive musical journeys designed to support authentic movement, emotional release, and deep embodiment. With a focus on somatic dance and therapeutic soundscapes, their sets are intentionally curated to guide dancers through an inner experience\u2014honouring the body\u2019s natural rhythms and the intelligence within. Their offerings create safe, accessible spaces for people of all bodies, backgrounds, and experience levels to explore movement, presence, and connection. Rooted in play, precision, and deep listening, Sonic Sutra brings music that moves beyond entertainment\u2014into healing and transformation.",

The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\n\nMaitreya\u2019s priorities\n\nTo help humanity in its task of global transformation, Maitreya has formulated certain priorities. They cover the essential needs of all people, every woman, man and child: an adequate supply of food\u037e housing for all; healthcare and education as basic universal rights. Other top priorities include the restoration of the environment and the establishment of peace.\n\nThe key to achieving these goals requires a major shift of present mind-set and thinking, structures and systems \u2013 and more equitable sharing of the world\u2019s food and resources. To realise humanity is one global family and the planet is a living being. According to Maitreya: \u201cWithout sharing, there can be no justice; without justice, there can be no peace; without peace, there can be no future.\u201d\n\n~ followed by short Transmission Meditation session ~\n\nShare International New Zealand.

Each garden tells a story and provides a visual image of wonderful creations.\nOne garden, allegedly with the best vista, has not been opened to the public before. One garden has previously featured in the House and Garden magazine. The tour (self-guided) will begin with lunch and an opportunity to buy potted plants in the tranquil St Alban's church garden, 11 Ngaio St Eastbourne, Lower Hutt, Wellington. The tour will end with hors d'oeuvre, wine and live music in the last garden.\nThis is a chance not just to visit amazing gardens but support the earthquake strengthening of St Alban's historic church and hall for a rejuvenated community hub.\nSt Albans church garden\nThe six private gardens all lie within a less than 100 m walk of the 83 Metlink Marine Parade bus route, but a car or bicycle would be more convenient.\nA glimpse of the six separate gardens (a-e).\na\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\nf\nThe garden show is in support of earthquake strengthening of the de Jersey Clere designed St Alban's church and adjacent hall to remake this a community hub.\nFor the last hundred years and more, this beautiful church designed by acclaimed architect Frederick de Jersey Clere has been the heart of Anglican parish life for people in the eastern bays of Wellington. People have rejoiced, prayed and wept in it through happy family milestones and sad occasions, through two world wars and countless celebrations and crises. Along with its parish hall and tranquil garden, it has been the base for social and community services and outreach, and its memorial wall houses the ashes of local residents.\nBut in 2016 the congregation had to suddenly leave the church, which was deemed an earthquake risk.\nSince then, the parish has explored alternatives for continuing its life and service to the people of the eastern bays. In that process it has kept its ministry and worship going through borrowed premises in local schools and other churches. Now, however, the parish has decided it needs to go back to its original base and strengthen both St Alban\u2019s Church and the parish hall so it can continue to serve the community from its heart and home in Ngaio Street, for the next hundred years and more.\nDetailed plans for strengthening the church and hall to meet acceptable safety standards have been drawn up, and fund-raising is under way. The parish is a registered charity (CC22188) and tax-deductible receipts will be issued for all donations.\nPostponement by 1 day to 30 Nov if weather were to dictate and would be announced on this web site.",

In this timeless realm, beyond the normal limitations of rational reality, anything is possible.\n\nAn epic adventure deep inside yourself.\n\nJourney to worlds within worlds on incredible sound waves.\n\nSika creates a safe space to relax deeply and connect with our inner guidance. This Sound Journey begins and ends with a short guided visualisation.\n\nThere will be two journeys with an interval.

The tent is lovely during the day, but as it gets dark, it takes on a magical feeling. Fairy lights and crystals lit by gently changing coloured lights. We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle. Arniya then dances the energy in with Celestial Energy Movement, for the group. This creates a vortex of Divine power into the middle of the tent. Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\n",

Set in 1954, the film follows Esmeralda Arboleda, a fiercely intelligent leader who sparks a revolution in a society deeply rooted in patriarchal traditions - a revolution that culminates in a fierce and decisve debate. A women group embarks on a historic struggle to bring the issue of women's right to vote before the National Constituent Assembly. With bold marches, radio appearances, and a brilliant media strategy that puts them on the front page, they achieve their goal, but the real challenge begins during the debate, where they face fierce opposition. Esmeralda Arboleda must endure personal attacks from the assembly members, and just as she is about to speak, she receives a heartbreaking call: her son has suffered a serious accident. She is torn between her duty as a mother and her commitment to the cause, with an unfavorable outcome. Although all seems to be lost, her perseverance leads to a historic victory when women's suffrage is finally approved, marking a turning point in Colombia's history.\n\n",

It is designed for advanced students and focuses on teaching a range of claw setting techniques, along with straightforward construction methods to securely hold gemstones of various shapes and sizes. The emphasis is on mastering the techniques rather than creating polished, finished jewellery pieces.\nStudents are encouraged to bring along their own particular tools, metal and stones if they would like to. They can also bring their own half made ring shanks or other projects to set into.\nThey will start by creating claw settings for flat-bottomed stones on plate to gain an understanding of how claws work.\nStudents will then move on to faceted stones and be shown how to construct their own settings in a number of styles, and how to secure their stones in settings. Finally, they will be taught the dos and don\u2019ts of finishing settings to a salable level.\nThe workshop will also look at how to use pre-made claw settings to best advantage.\nWorkshop fee $245, Early bird $221 till 27 July.

Instead of being talked at with boring slides, you\u2019ll step into three carefully designed games that let you actually practice leadership.\nYou\u2019ll be experimenting, problem-solving, laughing (a lot), and walking away with insights that stick because you\u2019ve lived them, not just heard them.\nThis isn\u2019t theory. It\u2019s leadership in action.\nLearn more at our website.\nHow it works\nThe day is made up of three 2-hour games.

    "description": "Book Club: Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods. Her works have appeared in the Politics, International Politics, Political Science, PS: Political Science & Politics, Journal of Contemporary China, Pacific Review, and Asian Security.\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 04:30 PM - 05:30 PM\nWelcome reception with refreshments and light catering\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 06:30 PM\nKeynote address: Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal Intern\nHost: Christina Lai\n\n\n",

They can be found on Instagram at @thesameerproject.\nMore information:\nJenin Jenin includes testimony from Jenin residents after the Israeli army\u2019s Defensive Shield operation, during which the city and camp were the scenes of fierce fighting. The operation ended with Jenin flattened and scores of Palestinians killed. Palestinians as well as numerous human rights groups accused Israel of committing war crimes in the April 2002 attack on the refugee camp. The sad question forces itself on the spectator: What will become of a country, a people when its children are confronted with war and violence from a very early age?",

In the Val-d'Oise region, this community, originally from Turkey and Iraq, has lived since the 1980s in a rhythm marked by weddings, church services, and family meals.\nShaped by the exile of their parents and the persecution their community faced under the Turkish dictatorship and Daesh, S\u00e9miramis nurtures her roots in Assyrian civilization, originating from Mesopotamia. But the puzzle of her history no longer fits together as it once did.\nGradually, the elders are disappearing, taking with them an identity and culture that is 6,000 years old. How can this fracture be repaired, and this heritage preserved? Should they consider staying or returning to their ancestral homeland, now that peace has returned? Can one go back after decades of conflict? Can they rebuild and start anew to live in peace with themselves and others?\n\"Return to Babylon\" is a road movie from Sarcelles to Erbil, following S\u00e9miramis and her family on a journey that leads them to question their future in France and the fate of their community in the Middle East.\nA film by Marie Dault, S\u00e9miramis Ide, and S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nDirected by S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nScreen time: 52-minutes; French and Assyrian with subtitles\nLink to the English-subtitled trailer: https://www.instagram.com/p/DDzsYJzt_B9/\nThe screening event will be held at the Cockburn Street Chapel, 1 Cockburn Street, Kilbirnie, Wellington from 5-7pm.\n\nEntrance is free, but please register to confirm your attendance.\n\nWe welcome koha (donations) which will go towards supporting the ACEYA Wellington Branch's youth-focused activities and events.",

    "description": "NZIFF: Dreams (Sex Love), A teenage girl recounts her crush for her teacher through the pages of a memoir. The winner of the Golden Bear 2025 is a lucid and tender chronicle of the unforgettable experience of first love.\n\nOriginally intended as the second chapter in his trilogy and released in Norway as such, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Dreams ended up premiering internationally as the last. But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Director Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hambalek taps into it with satirical, ribald flair and a twist of the fantastical in a sharp domestic parable for a new era of global surveillance paranoia.\n\nJulia (Julia Jentsch) is precariously close to a full-blown affair with the workmate she flirts with on smoking breaks. Her husband Tobias (Felix Kramer) dreams of getting even with a publishing house colleague who undercuts his authority in editorial design meetings. When their teenager Marielle (Laeni Geiseler) is slapped by a school friend over an insult, the impact leaves her with the sudden telepathic ability to see everything her parents do throughout the day \u2013 a development that spells disaster for the household, as dishonesty can no longer sustain the veneer of stable marital contentment.\n\nAs the family descends into a desperate, riotous war of manipulation, they must experiment with new moral codes. Is radical honesty and defiance the best course of action, or should they stifle egos and instincts in line with their preferred image? Better yet, can Marielle\u2019s new powers be curbed? \u2014 Carmen Gray",

As we continue our exploration of Dmitri Shostakovich's journey 50 years after his death, we present his fourth symphony. The work, was meant to be his boldest statement yet \u2014 but the composer withdrew it before its premiere. Why? The whispers were clear: this music would not please the authorities. It stayed hidden for decades, a secret too dangerous to share.\nWe partner with At The World's Edge Music Festival (AWE) to present the stunning talents of soloists Benjamin Baker (violin) and Yura Lee (viola) in a performance of Mozart\u2019s luminous Sinfonia Concertante. This work offers a moment of balance \u2014 a conversation between violin and viola, full of warmth and understanding, reminding us of beauty even in troubled times.\nWith generous support from the Orchestra Wellington Foundation we also reveal a brand-new secret: the world premiere of \"House of the Faun\" by WIlliam Philipson, the 2025 SOUNZ Commission for Orchestra and Sistema Youth Orchestra | Te Tono Mahinga a SOUNZ m\u0101 te R\u0101ngi Puoro me te R\u0101ngi Puoro Taiohi a Sistema.

Dr Barrie has recently revamped the Glendronach lineup, and we're going to see how she's doing: we'll try the previous 12 and 15 year--old bottlings against her new releases. She's worked her magic at Ben Riach, and we'll see how she's doing at Glendronach (I suspect quite well!). Additionally, we'll try the highland peated Glendronach, a departure from the familiar smokey peat of Islay. We'll expect a sweeter, softer style, bolstered by some sherry maturation.\nPlease join me for this wonderful tasting of Glendronachs:\nTuesday, September 9\n7:30pm Start time (arrive early to get a beer and a seat)\n$60 per person\nSeatoun Clubhouse (16 Dundas Street, Seatoun)\nSee you then,\nMatt\nMatt & the Clubhouse Team\n\n*** Please note you need to be a member or a guest of a member to attend.

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene.\nTiming:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLecture dates:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

John Campbell highlights some consistent themes of Brian Tamaki's Destiny Church: far-right prejudices, manifest anger, and hatred.\nIn Auckland on 21 June, Destiny Church organised a march to take \"a bold public stand for Christian values, Kiwi identity and the future of this nation\".\nOn Saturday, 13 September, Brian Tamaki attended the London \u201cUnite the Kingdom\u201d protest organised by far-right political activist Tommy Robinson that claimed to celebrate 'free speech', but also contained chants of hate, racist conspiracy theories, and Christian nationalist slogans. Among disturbing scenes, some people in the crowd ripped up a flag that read 'Secular Humanism'. To them, the very idea that people of all backgrounds and beliefs can live together with equality and respect is something to fear and destroy. For decades, the far right in the USA has painted humanism as a bogeyman, blaming it for liberal values, the rights of women, and the rights of LGBT people. It shows that those who thrive on fear are deliberately targeting the very values that underpin human rights and human dignity. Humanism is not a fringe or \u2018woke\u2019 idea. It is about fairness. It is about reason. It is about believing in the good that people are capable of when they are free to live their lives without fear or prejudice. These protests, which Brian Tamaki is supporting, are a show of force from those who wish to undo progress, to divide communities, and to undermine cherished freedoms.\nWe have a growing concern for secular values in our community. We cannot be silent. It is essential to keep compassion alive in public life and politics. After watching the documentary, we will discuss our concerns and how we might respond.\nTime: Oct 6, 2025 06:30 PM Auckland, Wellington\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/88183700512...\n",

When triggered, these unconscious \u201cprograms\u201d hijack our reactions, leaving us feeling stuck even when we want to move forward. In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore how trauma influences the nervous system and why awareness alone isn\u2019t enough to create lasting change.\nIn this 75 minute workshop, you\u2019ll discover how trauma impacts the nervous system and learn FasterEFT tools to release triggers, reframe old memories, and reset your stress response. You\u2019ll walk away with simple, science-backed practices you can use every day to build resilience and emotional freedom.\n\u201cThis is an interactive workshop where you\u2019ll connect with others. It\u2019s a powerful reminder that, beneath the surface, we generally share the same challenges and struggles\u2014and that healing becomes easier when we explore them together.\u201d\nMeet your host, Krishnaloka\nIntroducing Krishnaloka, who is driven to help others overcome their issues within their mind and pyschology.

Her warm and caring nature makes every interaction with her both comforting and transformative.\n\n\n6.15pm Tuesday 7th of October\nEnd the session on a high note with a delicious plant-based dinner, dessert, and good conversation.\nTickets available here~ bit.ly/eventTickets\nBhakti Lounge 1/175 Vivian Street, Te Aro, Wellington. http://www.bhaktilounge.org.nz ",

However, if you\u2019re currently in recovery, this can be extremely healing, and help you discover the deeper patterns that gave rise to this addiction. (Grof, 1985: 267 \u2013 268).\n-Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or psychosis\n-Hospitalisation for emotional crises in the last 10 years\n-Psychological conditions and diagnoses, which preclude safe emotional release.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the above, please inform Sarah.\n\n*Tickets are non-refundable, but are transferrable with 24 hours notice required.\n\n",

    "description": "Teaching Well - A supportive school for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), Growing attention to staff wellbeing has resulted in many workplace mental wellbeing initiatives. Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 20% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions. Post workshop consulting services such as mentoring the development of or reviewing a staff wellbeing plan can also be provided.\nPost Workshop Consult:\nSchools and Kuras have the option of a 90 minute consult with Barry in 2026 to review their staff wellbeing plan.\nAN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNING WITH INTERNATIONALLY RESPECTED AND AWARD WINNING MENTAL WELLBEING PRACTITIONER AND SUICIDOLOGIST, BARRY TAYLOR\nBarry has worked in mental wellbeing promotion and suicide prevention/postvention for 37 years at the local, national and international levels.  His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs.  He has worked extensively with schools both here and overseas supporting management and staff in the event of a suicide. He wrote the first suicide postvention guidelines for schools in 1990, developed the first national suicide prevention guidelines for schools in Australia in 1999 and reviewed and updated the NZ guidelines in 2010.\nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.  In recognition of his outstanding contribution to mental wellbeing and suicide prevention, he was awarded in 2016 the NSW Mental Health Commissioner's Community Champion Award.\nBarry has lectured on wellbeing both nationally and internationally and been appointed to numerous government advisory committees on mental wellbeing and suicide prevention.  He brings to this workshop extensive experience in advising communities and government on post-disaster recovery in terms of both mental wellbeing promotion / community resiliency and suicide prevention.\nAs a Health Sociologist and Public Health practitioner, Barry has a long-term interest in the social and cultural determinants of wellbeing, especially the role of gender and he brings a wealth of knowledge and passion for promoting wellbeing in men. He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing. He uses a population health and systems change approach, drawing on transformational change theory and collective impact.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to promote well wh\u0101nau, workplaces and communities and for the incorporation of wellbeing principles in public policy and social outcomes such as education, training and employment.\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

The tent is lovely during the day, but as it gets dark, it takes on a magical feeling. Fairy lights and crystals lit by gently changing coloured lights. We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle. Arniya then dances the energy in with Celestial Energy Movement, for the group. This creates a vortex of Divine power into the middle of the tent. Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\n",

When we connect to our inner foundations, we touch the support of those who came before and deepen our sense of belonging to life itself.\nWe\u2019ll begin with ceremonial cacao, then drop into a guided movement journey with live soundscape. There are no steps to learn, no performance\u2014just presence, curiosity, and letting your body move as it feels. Barefoot and phone-free, you\u2019re invited to drop deep into free-form movement, awakening parts of you that you may have forgotten.\nCome as you are.\nMove with what you feel.\nLeave feeling empowered, connected, and alive.\nSomatic dance is a guided movement practice that helps you tune into your body\u2019s wisdom and move from the inside out. Unlike ecstatic dance, which is typically an open, DJ-led space with no facilitation, somatic dance offers gentle guidance to support you in exploring sensation, emotion, and embodiment in a safe, intentional way. You\u2019re not learning steps or performing\u2014you're being invited into presence, curiosity, and feeling. With a focus on nervous system regulation, personal expression, and inner listening, somatic dance creates a nurturing space to come home to yourself.\nYour Hosts...\nJenna Joan | Embodiment Facilitator\nJenna Joan is a somatic therapist, yoga teacher, and group facilitator who has been leading movement spaces for over 15 years.

She has been hosting workshops, retreats, and community events for nearly a decade, and also works 1:1 in more therapeutic settings.\nSonic Sutra | Somatic Dance DJ\nSonic Sutra is a sound artist and somatic dance DJ who creates immersive musical journeys designed to support authentic movement, emotional release, and deep embodiment.

Their offerings create safe, accessible spaces for people of all bodies, backgrounds, and experience levels to explore movement, presence, and connection. Rooted in play, precision, and deep listening, Sonic Sutra brings music that moves beyond entertainment\u2014into healing and transformation.",
