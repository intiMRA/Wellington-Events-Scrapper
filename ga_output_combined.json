This exhibition will explore the tones, textures, composition and forms of the Chapel in black and white with many shades of grey.\n\"Generally, the older the equipment, the greater the personal input of the photographer is required and therefore the greater the commitment and individuality. Often, you can look at a 19th-century photograph and tell who the photographer is. You certainly can't do that today. It isn't only the camera and lens, but also the type of film (or in those days, glass plate), the developer used and how the print is made onto particular types of paper. Each gives a distinct interpretation\".\nJohn Grace - email - 18/06/25\nThe Trust looks forward to welcoming architects, designers, graduates, students and interested members of the public to attend this event and support the Trust in its work.\nThe Futuna Trust is a charitable organisation and all koha received from the exhibition events will go towards the ongoing care, maintenance and operation of Futuna Chapel and also to support various initiatives undertaken by the Trust.

These are lives shaped by love and politics, motherhood and memory, constraint and defiance.\nFrom girls raised in the garden of Plunket founder Truby King, to a queer university student at a mid-2000s Berlin rave, to a mother facing the cost of her son\u2019s climate rebellion, the women of All Her Lives are complex, resilient and deeply human. Shadowing their stories is the early feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, whose journey of grief and revolution will become a vessel for what endures \u2013 and for finding hope.\nVast and intimate, All Her Lives explores the layered selfhood of women \u2013 all that they inherit, sacrifice, imagine and carry forward \u2013 and the power found in unravelling and reweaving those selves on their own terms.\n'A wonderful collection that swims in and out of women's lives across time, exploring the struggle for freedom and love. I'll be thinking about it for a long time - a book of quiet force.' \u2014Emily Perkins, author of Lioness\nIngrid Horrocks\u2019s books include the memoir Where We Swim (2021), a literary history, Women Wanderers and the Writing of Mobility (2017), and two collections of poetry.

The book will be launched by Harry Ricketts.\n\n- Thursday 18 September, 6pm\n- Unity Books Wellington\n- Free event \u2013 all welcome!\n\nJoseph Kinsey is not a name many of us know \u2013 or not as well as we know the name Robert Falcon Scott. But from his base in Christchurch, Kinsey \u2013 book and art collector, philanthropist, science enthusiast, businessman \u2013 forged deep connections with the Antarctic expeditions and the explorers themselves through his tireless work as the agent for various expeditions. Two other New Zealanders also formed close friendships: Charles Bowen, a former politician, and Wellington lawyer Leonard Tripp, to whom Shackleton declared: \u2018I love you as David and Jonathan loved.\u2019\n\nSouth by South tells the story of New Zealand\u2019s role in \u2018the Heroic Age\u2019, that wave of exploration beginning at the end of the nineteenth century in which men set out to traverse the continent of Antarctica and, if they survived, to bring home their findings. The members of this New Zealander triumvirate were all believers in the British Empire, but the southern voyages were to an uninhabited land.\n\nSouth by South brings to light many letters, newspaper articles, and pieces of official correspondence, much of which has not been published before, during the five expeditions of 1901\u20131916: the Discovery, Nimrod, Terra Nova, Aurora, and Endurance. In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship. What they and the explorers wrote was influenced by nineteenth-century adventure stories which conveyed the Imperialist ideals of the time. If the impending conflict of 1914\u201318 was a very \u2018literary war\u2019, this was a very literary exploration.\n\nCharles Ferrall is an associate professor at Te Herenga Waka\u2013Victoria University of Wellington. Among his books are Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics (2001); The Trials of Eric Mareo (2002), co-written with Rebecca Ellis; East by South: China in the Australasian Imagination (2006), co-edited with Paul Millar and Keren Smith; Juvenile Literature and British Society 1850\u20131950 (2009), co-written with Anna Jackson; Henry Lawson in New Zealand (2012); How We Remember: New Zealanders and the First World War (2014), co-edited with Harry Ricketts; and Remembering Gallipoli: Interviews with New Zealand Gallipoli Veterans (2015), co-edited with Christopher Pugsley.\n\nCover photograph: The ship Discovery leaving Lyttelton Harbour, 1901.

Shut her eyes. Rolled their names around her brain. Stacked each person in order like folded laundry, warm and crisp from the sun. She wondered how her name would sound amongst them.\n\nIn the rural reaches of Auckland, the women of the eclectic Gordon family gather for Christmas. They may push each other\u2019s buttons, but know precisely when to offer tea (or a tipple). Rita, the 50-year-old baby of the family, is planning to tell them she has cancer. Drifting between past and present, she considers the lives of women in their community and reckons with what it all means for her future and her family.\n\nFeaturing elderly lesbians, twins who aren\u2019t twins, and several dogs named Roger, Hoods Landing is about shoddy pasts, ambiguous futures and the imperfect bonds that tie family together.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nLaura Vincent (Ng\u0101ti M\u0101hanga, Ng\u0101puhi) is an author whose work spans fiction, poetry and food writing.

Peter is reluctant to stay with nanna in the school holidays because she lives in the country and doesn't have a TV but Nanna finds ways to engage Peter in her love of the forest, especially the precious manu, when they build a nesting box for Ruru together. Peter is excited to see if Ruru will make her home in the box, waiting patiently while many other birds arrive to check out the box first! And after all that waiting, Nanna takes Peter on an exciting night time forest walk to find Ruru - in the dark! The bird characters are all familiar New Zealand locals, such as piwakawaka, kereru, tui and ruru, and the story highlights the importance of supporting them and the different needs they may have. Teachers and Parents have been ecstatic about this show and hundreds of New Zealand children have been transfixed by it.\nAs quoted by Theatreview: \u201cThis is truly a New Zealand show for New Zealand children and all those young-at-heart\u201d.\n\n\nPrices are just $15.00 per person\nUnder 2's are free\nSpecial $7 preview show on Saturday September 20th 2025!\n",

Two other New Zealanders also formed close friendships: Charles Bowen, a former politician, and Wellington lawyer Leonard Tripp, to whom Shackleton declared: \u2018I love you as David and Jonathan loved.\u2019\n\nSouth by South tells the story of New Zealand\u2019s role in \u2018the Heroic Age\u2019, that wave of exploration beginning at the end of the nineteenth century in which men set out to traverse the continent of Antarctica and, if they survived, to bring home their findings. The members of this New Zealander triumvirate were all believers in the British Empire, but the southern voyages were to an uninhabited land.\n\nSouth by South brings to light many letters, newspaper articles, and pieces of official correspondence, much of which has not been published before, during the five expeditions of 1901\u20131916: the Discovery, Nimrod, Terra Nova, Aurora, and Endurance. In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship. What they and the explorers wrote was influenced by nineteenth-century adventure stories which conveyed the Imperialist ideals of the time. If the impending conflict of 1914\u201318 was a very \u2018literary war\u2019, this was a very literary exploration.\n\nCharles Ferrall is an associate professor at Te Herenga Waka\u2013Victoria University of Wellington. Among his books are Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics (2001); The Trials of Eric Mareo (2002), co-written with Rebecca Ellis; East by South: China in the Australasian Imagination (2006), co-edited with Paul Millar and Keren Smith; Juvenile Literature and British Society 1850\u20131950 (2009), co-written with Anna Jackson; Henry Lawson in New Zealand (2012); How We Remember: New Zealanders and the First World War (2014), co-edited with Harry Ricketts; and Remembering Gallipoli: Interviews with New Zealand Gallipoli Veterans (2015), co-edited with Christopher Pugsley.\n\nCover photograph: The ship Discovery leaving Lyttelton Harbour, 1901.

    "description": "Manage Your Expectations, Created and Performed by Eliza Sanders\nProduced by House of Sand\nDirected by Charley Allanah\n\nYou decide the ending\u2026\n\nSolo performer Eliza Sanders has a simple task: to tell you everything that will happen in the show, so you can decide if you would like to see it. Nothing is ever so simple.\n\nThis genre-defying work of dance, theatre, live film, clown and absurd philosophising takes the idea of the \u2018trigger warning\u2019 to its absurdist extreme to question how \u2018informed\u2019 consent can really be, and asking \u2018How much do you really want to know?\u2019\n\nCreated and performed by multi-award-winning maverick of the stage Eliza Sanders, Manage Your Expectations helps us to see the limits of the power to communicate and our failures to say what we mean. Through movement, multimedia, and razor-sharp wit, it examines the impossibility of perfect communication, musing on the influence of context, identity and personal history while creating something beautiful from our collective mess.\n\n\u201cClever, witty, evocative, subversive, immersive, despairing, poignant, personal and universal\u201d \u2014 Deirdre Tarrant, Theatreview\n\n\u201cBeautifully vulnerable\u201d \u2013 Chloe Jaques, Theatreview, 2024\n\nFull of vigour, energy, chaos and a hint of confrontation, Manage Your Expectations is a mind (and body) bending show about how we connect in an increasingly complex world. And you decide the ending\u2026\n\nContent warning: this show contains explicit content, mild coarse language, heavy nudity, themes of abortion and rape.\n\nWINNER: Best Performer, Whang\u0101rei Fringe 2024\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance, NZ Fringe 2024\nWINNER: San Diego Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Best in Fringe, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Innovative Work, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Sydney Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Auckland Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Melbourne Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Adelaide Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Original Production, Wellington Theatre Awards 2024\n\nTues 16 \u2013 Sat 20 Sept 2025\nQ&A and Choose Your Price Night: Wed 17 Sept\nRelaxed Performance: Thurs 18 Sept\nCirca Two\nTues \u2013 Fri 7.30pm, Sat 20 Sept 2.00pm & 7.30pm\nShow Duration: 75 minutes no interval\nRecommended Age 16+",

Three mixed-race artists from across Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui \u2014 Carmel Aroha Salmanzadeh, Jessica Miku and Anthony Zemke \u2014 trace the echoes of matrilineal language and culture, reaching for words that live in their mothers\u2019 voices but not their own. The show speaks to the intricacies of love, loss, grief and gratitude. To inherit a tongue but not its fluency is to stand at the threshold of intimacy \u2014 close enough to hear it, yet unable to fully enter. At its heart are nine paintings that pursue a multifaceted visual language that expresses the artists\u2019 ability (or inability) to connect without language.\nTo love without saying \u201cI love you\u201d \u2013 \u201cka nui taku aroha ki a koe\u201d / \u201d\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0645\u201d / \u201c\u3044\u3064\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u201d\nAnthony Zemke (b. 1998, Aotearoa) is an Iranian-P\u0101keh\u0101 illustrator and painter based in T\u0101maki Makaurau.\nWorking within a conceptual framework guided by the Baha\u2019i teachings, Eastern mysticism, and Continental philosophy, Zemke\u2019s practice sees abstraction as the ideal vehicle for communicating psychosocial and spiritual realities. His works explore the boundaries of language, the dialectic of human oneness and diversity, and the various dimensions of radical compassion.\nCarmel Salmanzadeh (b. 2002, T\u0101maki Makaurau) is of M\u0101ori, Iranian, Samoan and Chinese descent. He uri t\u0113nei n\u014d Ng\u0101ti Hauaa, Waikato, Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti, Ng\u0101ti Ira me Ng\u0101ti Porou. Salmanzadeh traces links\nbetween the pictorial languages and motifs used in the traditional and indigenous practices of her multiethnic\nwhakapapa; exploring how visual narratives transcend cultural boundaries. Manifested in large-scale pieces, their works are influenced by the structure and design of Persian carpets, Samoan siapo and M\u0101ori taniko.\nJessica Miku (b. 2000, Whang\u0101rei) is a Japanese/P\u0101keh\u0101 artist based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Using the Japanese cultural anthropological concept Hare-Ke, which harmonises the fantastical with the mundane, they produce paintings of imagined female figures within ecological fantasy. These portals of otherworldliness are used to explore notions of tenderness\u2014in heart, soul, and flesh.\nPromotional Design by Tamara Irvine\nThis exhibition will be accompanied by a written work by Yue Pibrow ",

The result is a joyful celebration of music, storytelling, and community.\n\nMulgan\u2019s score is witty, playful, and sophisticated, full of catchy rhythms, lyrical arias, and imaginative textures. It captures the drama and comedy of the tale while remaining approachable and fun for newcomers to opera. Both seasoned opera-goers and first-time audiences will find themselves swept up in the sparkle and charm of this inventive work.\n\nWith its empowering message, interactive spirit, and musical brilliance, Red! is an opera for today\u2019s families\u2014offering laughter, excitement, and a reminder that even the smallest voices can make themselves heard.\n\n",

    "description": "The Monster in the Maze, The myth of the Minotaur is a tale almost as old as storytelling itself, but with The Monster in the Maze Jonathan Dove and Alisdair Middleton have excavated rich, new life from this classic. In this brand new staging by director Anapela Polataivao (Red White and Brass, Wild Dogs Under My Skirt), this story will be told as never before.\n\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he metes out his punishment in the cruellest way possible: by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth, to be fed to the terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze: the Minotaur. As King Minos triumphs, his great monster \u201cwill eat your future, it will rip your hope, it will stamp your youth, your children in the sand.\u201d\n\nAs the vindictive king will soon learn, however, these youth will not accept their fate without a fierce challenge. The Monster in the Maze is a story about resistance; about justice; about finding power not in oppression, but in collectivism. Fittingly, then, it\u2019s also a groundbreaking work in its form: a community-focused and community-driven opera in which young and community singers and players stand proudly shoulder-to-shoulder with their professional counterparts, and in which both are integral.\n\nThe Monster in the Maze has been roundly praised by audiences, participants and reviewers worldwide, and in its Aotearoa debut season, it will serve as a gorgeous articulation of New Zealand Opera\u2019s reciprocal community kaupapa.\n\nSung in English with surtitles.",

For us, it\u2019s not just a chance to hang photographs on the wall \u2013 it\u2019s an opportunity to celebrate the art of photography, showcase the talent within our community, and invite others to discover what makes photography such an inspiring and accessible pursuit.\nThis year\u2019s exhibition offers a diverse collection of images captured both close to home and further afield. You\u2019ll see photographs from all around the world \u2013 landscapes, portraits, street scenes, and wildlife \u2013 but the heart of the exhibition is firmly rooted in Wellington.

These gatherings are at the heart of what we do as a society, offering members the chance to connect, experiment, and grow their photographic skills in a supportive and friendly environment.

Give yourself a gift of a new creative hobby (or maybe even a career?) this spring!\n\nThe students start with basic ring making in copper or brass. We begin with ring making as this process teaches students many fundamental techniques in one project, measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting, soldering and finishing are all included in this one ring.\n\nStudents will learn how to measure their fingers to get an accurately sized ring, later they will also learn how to take sizing from existing rings. They are shown how to use a jeweller\u2019s saw to cut their metal to the correct length, how to form it up and how to solder.\n\nThen they learn how to shape their rings and finish them up into a wearable piece of jewellery, all in the first class!\n\nIn the first session they are also shown how to texture metals, cut and layer shapes, melt balls of silver and other techniques to create decorative elements.\n\nStudents can spend their evening thinking about and planning their design in silver for the next day. We encourage them to carefully plan this project and think about how they might make their piece before they begin, including creating drawings and notes. (We always say drawings don\u2019t need to be \u201cgood\u201d, they just need to make sense to the student and their tutor!). This project can be another ring, or earrings or pendants. We have a great selection of example pieces in the workshop so they can see what\u2019s achievable in the 3-hour time frame. Sometimes students can make more than one silver piece if they have enough time.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are copper and brass for practising on, up to 8 grams of sterling silver and all consumables such as sandpaper, solder and chemicals. Extra metals and chains are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nKids 12 and up are welcome in this class, any person under 16 years old must be accompanied by an enrolled caregiver.",

Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!! This booking is for FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER\n                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cWithin the DNA is written not only our histories as individuals but the whole history of the human race \u2026 patterns of DNA that have come down to us virtually unchanged from our distant ancestors \u2013 ancestors who are no longer just an abstract entity but real people who lived in conditions very different from those we enjoy today, who survived them and brought up their children.\u201d ~ Bryan Sykes (The Seven Daughters of Eve)\nReturn to MAIN EXHIBITION WEBSITE - link coming soon",

    "description": "Hands-on Sourdough Workshop, Sourdough for Beginners - $120 (paid via internet banking)\nCome join us for a hands-on, in-person sourdough workshop at Willow Corner Collective headquarters (aka my home)! This workshop is currently the only hands-on sourdough workshop being offered in the Nelson region - I teach and demonstrate to you and then you get to mix and practice on your own dough as we go along.\nWhether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this event is perfect for anyone looking to master the art of making sourdough bread, learning from someone who has 10+ years of experience. Perhaps you've found all the Youtube tutorials and Instagram how-to's overwhelming and are keen to learn via an in-person class. Then this is for you! I've baked hundreds of loaves in the last year alone, sold at a market, and hosted a pop-up shop. However, my passion really lies with teaching others to bake their own sourdough in their own homes, for their own families (or small businesses - one day!).You will be taught, demonstrated to, and then you get to have a go yourself; whilst learning my tips and tricks along the way. Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes and troubleshoot guide\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 6-8pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. If for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though. In extenuating circumstances I may be able to hold your ticket for a future workshop; this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n*Payment to clear in bank account two days after ticket bought, after which time your ticket will be released on to someone else. Please pay immediately upon purchasing ticket.\n**All workshop info you need to know ahead of time is in the confirmation email. Please ensure you read this down to the bottom.\n***I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\n\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight! From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody",

Figuring out what matters to you, then learning how to grow your fragmented ideas into something whole. For example, how do you turn a feeling, or a fleeting moment in time into a story? Into a painting? Into a work of art? What are the building blocks you need?\n3. Inspiration from other creative sources: people, music, poetry, reading, random incidents. Ways to generate fresh ideas. How to clarify and focus in writing and art.\n4. Structure and boundaries. Dreaming big but being real. How do you find and stick to a creative process?

    "description": "VEGYN (DJ SET) | WELLINGTON | MEOW, Sprawling with obtuse bass lines, sharp digital peaks and asymmetrical drum machines, Vegyn\u2019s music doesn\u2019t walk a straight line so much as trip over itself beautifully.\nThe London-born producer, artist, DJ and label head returns to Australia and New Zealand this October for a rare run of headline shows, supported by NYC producer amr*.\nAcross everything he touches - from surreal club sets to production work for Travis Scott, JPEGMafia and Frank Ocean - Joseph Thornalley makes music that\u2019s hard to pin down and harder to forget. His productions are jagged and abstract, built from negative space, ambient haze and rhythms that never quite resolve. There\u2019s hip hop in the DNA, but it never plays by the rules, always veering towards something stranger, softer, rawer.\nThrough his label PLZ Make It Ruins, Vegyn has built an entire world. His 2019 debut Only Diamonds Cut Diamonds felt like a manifesto; the 71-track Text While Driving If You Want To Meet God! followed as a chaotic, genre-agnostic statement of intent. Since then, he\u2019s ventured further leftfield, releasing The Head Hurts but the Heart Knows the Truth under the alias Headache, followed by the 2024 masterpiece The Road to Hell Is Paved with Good Intention, and the unexpected arrival of Blue Moon Safari - an output that feels made more for himself than for any audience. Dreamlike, disjointed and deeply personal.\nAs a DJ, Vegyn shifts between industrial breaks, ambient drift and warped club memories. This October, he returns to Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Wellington and Auckland - a rare chance to slip through the cracks and step inside his world.\n",

He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene and GIB.\nCPD points: 10\nTIMING:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLECTURE DATES:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

The bill set out to decriminalise homosexual activity between consenting adults and make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t the first attempt at homosexual law reform. Join us on this special 90-minute free walk tour to celebrate the people and movements that fought for a brighter future for rainbow communities.\n\nOur journey begins at the location of the first public meeting in New Zealand, advocating for homosexual law reform in 1967. This was two years before the Stonewall uprising in the U.S. which went on to ignite Gay Liberation around the world.\n\nThe tour ends at Parliament, where we honour the Members of Parliament who have championed equality over the last five decades.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll reflect on some of the difficult realities rainbow communities have faced, from the injustices of the legal system, to the stances of the medical profession, churches and the military. As the late activist Ralph Knowles recalls, \u201cAs far as medicine was concerned, it was sick. As far as the law was concerned, it was a crime. As far as the church was concerned, it was a sin.\u201d\n\nThough at times the stories are challenging, this walk tour is ultimately uplifting, as we pay tribute to our amazing rainbow kaumatua and allies who led the way.\n\nCOST: Free, but please register so we can manage the number of walkers: https://walktoursnz.wordpress.com/book/\n\nDATE/TIME: 1pm, Sunday 19th October 2025\n\nSTARTS: meet at the rugby sculpture, Jack Ilott Green, corner of Harris Street & Jervois Quay (just by Civic Square)\n\nENDS: Parliament grounds\n\nDURATION: 1 hour 30mins\n\nACCESSIBILITY: the tour is on flat public footpaths, with a light incline as we enter Parliament grounds. Tours are limited to approximately 20 walkers.\n\nThis tour is part of the amazing Wellington Heritage Festival - https://wellingtonheritagefestival.co.nz\n\n",

It traces the beginnings of human communication and the development of writing.\n\nHow can we as educators encourage writing in our Montessori environments and ensure collaborations and an understanding of the basic writing processes, bring success and enthusiasm to the telling of powerful stories?\n\nWhat are some of the stumbling blocks for children when researching? How can we provide strategies and structure to enable lively and informative information writing?\n\nIn this day-long face to face workshop, with a focus on guidance for narrative and information writing, participants will be invited into the world of learning to write. Strategies and exercises to stimulate interest and action for writers will be given, alongside challenges and advanced crafting lessons for more fluent writers in 6-9 and 9-12 classrooms. We will examine elements of structuring, elaboration, character and place, revision, and author techniques. Note taking and writing for research will be included in an information writing session.\n\nDay 2: Sunday 14th September\nCome prepared to share your collective wisdom while we align NZC History curriculum to what we do in our classrooms to ensure that everything is covered. By September we will also have a better idea of where the conventional system is headed with the new-look maths coming out.

    "description": "Film screening: GAGA, Film screening: GAGA\nJoin us for a special screening of the 2022 Taiwanese comedy-drama film GAGA, featuring a Q&A with the award-winning Director, Laha Mebow\n\nAbout this Event\n\nGaga\u300a\u54c8\u52c7\u5bb6\u300b(2022)\nDirected by Laha Mebow 112 mins, Mandarin/Atayal/Taiwanese, English subtitles\nAmong the Atayal indigenous people of Taiwan, gaga is the traditional law and custom, the way of living with the land and organising society, the source of values. When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation",

Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day.

Despite progress for some groups, the Pacific population remains on the wrong side of the statistical ledger.\nPacific peoples experience:\n\u2022 The highest rates of avoidable hospitalisations and chronic conditions.\n\u2022 Worst material deprivation across nearly every indicator.\n\u2022 Persistently low home ownership rates.\n\u2022 A widening education achievement gap, often masked by ethnic averages.\n\u2022 Underrepresentation in decision-making, leadership, and governance roles.\nWhile initiatives for M\u0101ori advancement are critical and must continue, Pacific peoples require their own distinct policy lens.

By 1917 the system had grown and 17 was rebuilt into its current form adding a set of trucks converting the tram to 8 wheels. Tram tram saw regular service until the 1940\u2019s where it was eventually use for peak time travel, before being withdrawn in the late 50\u2019s.\nIt was then sold, and taken to Bell road in Raumati on the Kapiti coast where it served as a beach hutt until the 80\u2019s where it was donated to the Wellington tramway museum for display and eventual restoration.\n2014 a conservation and restoration plan was put together, and the tram was shipped out to the Wheelwright Shop in the Wairarapa for a full body overhaul. It was transported back to the museum in 2017 and put on public display until new trucks (wheelsets) could be manufacturedby A&G price in Thames.\nSince 2019 the tram has undergone new wiring, and extensive testing and running in and is now ready to take passengers along our museum.\nTram 17 is a wonderful achievement by all\nThose involved, and we cannot wait to welcome you this Father\u2019s Day to enjoy a ride on this heritage tram, saved from the scrap heap, and then saved again from rotting away.\nPlease note: We intend to run tram 17, however due to the nature and style of the tram, its operation is weather dependent. If we deem that the tram cannot run, we will advise accordingly. ",

Tram tram saw regular service until the 1940\u2019s where it was eventually use for peak time travel, before being withdrawn in the late 50\u2019s.\nIt was then sold, and taken to Bell road in Raumati on the Kapiti coast where it served as a beach hutt until the 80\u2019s where it was donated to the Wellington tramway museum for display and eventual restoration.\n2014 a conservation and restoration plan was put together, and the tram was shipped out to the Wheelwright Shop in the Wairarapa for a full body overhaul. It was transported back to the museum in 2017 and put on public display until new trucks (wheelsets) could be manufacturedby A&G price in Thames.\nSince 2019 the tram has undergone new wiring, and extensive testing and running in and is now ready to take passengers along our museum.\nTram 17 is a wonderful achievement by all\nThose involved, and we cannot wait to welcome you this Father\u2019s Day to enjoy a ride on this heritage tram, saved from the scrap heap, and then saved again from rotting away.\nPlease note: We intend to run tram 17, however due to the nature and style of the tram, its operation is weather dependent. If we deem that the tram cannot run, we will advise accordingly. ",

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

Set in 1954, the film follows Esmeralda Arboleda, a fiercely intelligent leader who sparks a revolution in a society deeply rooted in patriarchal traditions - a revolution that culminates in a fierce and decisve debate. A women group embarks on a historic struggle to bring the issue of women's right to vote before the National Constituent Assembly. With bold marches, radio appearances, and a brilliant media strategy that puts them on the front page, they achieve their goal, but the real challenge begins during the debate, where they face fierce opposition. Esmeralda Arboleda must endure personal attacks from the assembly members, and just as she is about to speak, she receives a heartbreaking call: her son has suffered a serious accident. She is torn between her duty as a mother and her commitment to the cause, with an unfavorable outcome. Although all seems to be lost, her perseverance leads to a historic victory when women's suffrage is finally approved, marking a turning point in Colombia's history.\n\n",

Known for his raw vocals, heartfelt lyrics, and a genre-defying blend of folk, blues, rock, and soul, Shawn has captivated audiences around the globe.\nFollowing a massive international tour and the rise of his hit song \"Through the Valley\" -featured in the critically acclaimed The Last of Us series - Shawn is thrilled to announce his debut run across Aotearoa.\nCatch him live this October for three unforgettable shows:\nWednesday, October 15 - Loons, Christchurch\nThursday, October 16 - San Fran, Wellington\nFriday, October 17 - Double Whammy, Auckland\nTickets are on sale this Friday the 30th of May at 1:00 pm\nPre sale starts tomorrow, Thursday the 29th of May at 1:00 pm\nDon't miss this rare chance to experience the intensity and emotion of Shawn James in an intimate live setting. Tickets are expected to move fast - secure yours now!\n\"Hey there, this is Shawn James. I\u2019ve had way too many writers think they could sum me up & relay what I\u2019m about from an hour long conversation so they could write my \u201cbio\u201d but I\u2019ve had it. Screw that. I\u2019ll tell it in my own words.\nI was born & raised in Chicago, Illinois. I grew up on the south side of the city where I attended a gospel church. I was always around a lot of heartfelt soulful music & hardworking, real, down to earth people. Although I no longer abide by any religion, I value the times I had and how they shaped me to be what I am now. I\u2019ve moved around quite a bit living in all different parts of the US.\nWhile absorbing all sorts of different cultures from here & around the world, I\u2019ve developed my own sound. I started releasing my own music in 2012 and haven\u2019t stopped since. I play a wide range of music from folk to blues, r&b, Gospel to rock, metal & alotta things in between. The main constant amongst all the genres would be that it\u2019s all done with emotion, feeling, heart & a lotta soul. I mean what I say & deeply feel what I play.\nI play covers of songs I dig sometimes and although some people may only know me because of those, I\u2019m hardly just a cover artist.\nIf you come see me play live and expect just one style or aspect of what I do, you may be disappointed to learn that our shows are a roller coaster of emotions, musical styles, intensity & energy. I get bored easily & love to mix things up. Be ready & bring your ear plugs just in case..\nI\u2019ve always been the underdog so to speak since I\u2019ve never had the backing of a large record label, big marketing firm or massive PR company & I truly like it that way. I feel as though I\u2019ve earned what I have through hard work, determination, a good bit of luck & the great relationships with people I\u2019ve made along the way. I\u2019ve learned a lot of lessons the hard way being in this \u201cmusic business industry\u201d and that\u2019s alright by me.\nI\u2019ve seen that with your support (the listeners out there) I can make my wildest dreams come true.\nIf you want to listen to an artist that\u2019s authentic, genuine & original then you\u2019ve come to the right place. I hope you enjoy the music & will join me on this journey that I\u2019m so extremely grateful to be on.\nThank you all so very much.\nLove,\nShawn James\" ",

The Magnificat is a world favourite, arguably Bach's best choral piece that has transcended the ages, celebrating Luke's description of Mary's pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, the choir and orchestra perform Ritchie's Then I Understood. When a child of seven to nine, Laura Rangers sketched eight poems centred on summers at Otaki Beach, Ritchie seized the opportunity to add the musical dimension and the result are dual choirs - the Renaissance Singers split - accompanied by the Sinfonia to set off Rangers' delightful insights, so elegantly displayed. The magic that can be childhood.\n\nThe concert has a celebratory theme, it being the 50th anniversary of the choir. Thus the inclusion of Forrest's Three Nocturnes that express the wonderment involved when examining the heavens and the universe full of stars. Throughout this piece the percussionists alone from the Sinfonia provide whimsical accompaniment with a celeste providing the heavenly tones - a hit when played on the last occasion the choir sang the piece.\n\nOpening the concert will be Carl Orff's O Fortuna from his popular Carmina Burana. While O Fortuna laments the role of fate it is set in the larger piece that celebrates life with gusto.\n\nWith the performers in great form (two choristers just back from singing with the world's best choir) this concert will no doubt build the sense of celebration - full of life and wonderment.\n\nGeneral Admission $25, Concession $20, Secondary School $15,\nUnder 13 Free.\n\n",

    "description": "Teaching Well - Supportive schools for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), With the growing emphasis on staff wellbeing there is a plethora of workplace mental wellbeing programmes on offer. However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages. In fact, the staff consultation is, in itself, is a wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 30% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions.

His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs. \nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.

He wrote the first national guidelines for suicide prevention in Australian schools and undertook a review of the NZ guidelines.\nAs a Health Sociologist and Public Health practitioner, Barry has a long-term interest in the social and cultural determinants of wellbeing, especially the role of gender and he brings a wealth of knowledge and passion for promoting wellbeing in men. He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing. He uses a population health and systems change approach, drawing on transformational change theory and collective impact.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to promote well wh\u0101nau, workplaces and communities and for the incorporation of wellbeing principles in public policy and social outcomes such as education, training and employment.\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

Over two three-hour sessions, 20 and 27 September, 10am-1pm, you will be given an understanding of the technique of setting faceted stones using a setting burr, hammers, punches and burnishing tools. This is the first step in learning to flush set facet cut stones so they sit below the surface of the metal.\n\nSession 1 will cover the technique, demonstrations and the basics of preparing and cutting the setting. Students will be shown how to set their stones, and may begin to do this in class, but will then go on to repeat and practice the technique in their own time.\nThey can do this at home, or for a small extra cost, can stay on at the studio to practice setting for the afternoon.\n\nSession 2 will pick up on the setting techniques, reminding and refining essential steps in the process. Troubleshooting can be covered in this class, as well as learning to clean up the settings. The principles of this setting technique will be covered in a few different scenarios, as some students may wish to take this skill into different styles or directions.\n\nThe option for students to have a half-day bench hire after class will also apply to this session.\n\nWhat is provided: class fees cover your practice metal (copper) and stones (CZ) and detailed handouts that are useful for you to take away to refer to when practising and honing your skills.\n\nCorrectly sized drills and setting burrs will be provided in class, but students must purchase their own burrs for practice after class and any future bench hires. These are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nWhat to bring: Advanced students can bring projects to set stones into, but please note the metal must be at least 2mm thick and we do not allow brass to be used as a project or practice for beginners. The metal must be copper or sterling silver.\n\nStudents should bring either a craft magnifier or magnifying lenses/glasses. If you have your own flex shaft tool you plan to use at home for drilling and setting, please also bring this along so that your tutor can advise on the best way to use it. We have two drilling machines in the studio, and these must be shared between the students, so if you have a machine, do bring it.\n\nPractice bench hire after class $20 per person (till 4pm) must be booked in advance.\n\nWorkshop fee $195, Early bird $175 till 24 August.\n\n",

Course costs include basic materials for the process, but do not include the eventual metal costs for the pieces you choose to cast. As this is subject to each students' choice of size and type of metal, we leave this up to you to decide.\n\nCastings may cost between $5 and $40 depending on whether you cast in Silver or Bronze. Casting in Bronze or Brass will be much cheaper.\n\nLevel two: expand your range of designs and skills with the wax you prefer using. Learn to set stones into your designs and either: Cast them IN the metal (exciting and organic) or, more advanced students can learn to set them in a fabrication class.\n\nClasses fill fast so please book now to reserve your place!",

Before\nlong, the dualistic significance of their musical partnership\noutshone any need for a bass player and\nhas since served to both challenge and empower the\nband\u2019s creativity. Following their 2010 live debut in\nZ\u00fcrich, B\u00d8LZER soon made a name for themselves\nas the remarkable Swiss-Antipodean duo capable of\nconjuring up mighty barriers of sound with nothing\nbut a ten-stringed guitar and an almost ritualistic\npercussion style. The pair describe their own stage\nexperience as a form of spiritual rapture, an atavistic\nvortex woven together from the profound union\nof spectacle meeting spectator on a deeper plane.\n",

People have rejoiced, prayed and wept in it through happy family milestones and sad occasions, through two world wars and countless celebrations and crises. Along with its parish hall and tranquil garden, it has been the base for social and community services and outreach, and its memorial wall houses the ashes of local residents.\nBut in 2016 the congregation had to suddenly leave the church, which was deemed an earthquake risk.\nSince then, the parish has explored alternatives for continuing its life and service to the people of the eastern bays. In that process it has kept its ministry and worship going through borrowed premises in local schools and other churches. Now, however, the parish has decided it needs to go back to its original base and strengthen both St Alban\u2019s Church and the parish hall so it can continue to serve the community from its heart and home in Ngaio Street, for the next hundred years and more.\nDetailed plans for strengthening the church and hall to meet acceptable safety standards have been drawn up, and fund-raising is under way. The parish is a registered charity (CC22188) and tax-deductible receipts will be issued for all donations.\nPostponement by 1 day to 30 Nov if weather were to dictate and would be announced on this web site.",

    "description": "Jewellery-making in 8 weeks - Tuesday Eve Mixed Level, This class is mixed level, allowing beginners to work alongside advanced students. It starts on Tuesday, 14 October and runs for 8 weeks till Tuesday, 2 December, 5.30pm - 8pm.\nOur popular weeknight classes are the best way for beginners to get into jewellery making in a lively, warm and friendly environment.\n\nBeginners start with basic ring-making and stone-setting in copper or brass. Students will learn measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting and soldering. Then we move on to making a practice-ring set with a Cabochon stone (cabochon means it has a flat bottom and a smooth domed top) in a Bezel Setting. The stone-setting process teaches you many fundamental techniques in one project! As you work through your practice-ring and setting, you can move onto working in silver and produce another ring with a cabachon stone that you really love. This way you will learn the basics as you go on your practice-ring, before taking the next step in costly silver.\n\nLevel 2 students learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking as a way to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project so they have something to hone their skills that they are familiar with, as well as taking on a new skill. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet or a more complex bezel setting - for example a teardrop or soft square stone to take on bezels with corners!\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple projects they can work on self-directed in class: more chains or simple bezel settings are ideal - to help them strengthen their soldering skills - alongside a challenge project that might be a shelf setting (an adaptation of a bezel setting that can take faceted stones), a tube setting or a larger bezel setting for a box or brooch. Our tutors will work with you to discover your passions in the world of making, and to support your skills so you grow your understanding with each block you take. We recommend that students from level 3 and up take the occasional Technique class (for example - claw setting, enamelling, flush setting) and then bring those techniques into their projects in their block class to be supported in their practice and skill by their regular tutor.\n\nThis class fee does NOT include materials for any student.\nBeginners should expect to spend at least $60 on materials for their ring making project.\nAll metals and stones as well as quality findings and chains are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it thriftily in future projects!\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time please email us to arrange this ;)",

Stallholders travel from around the North Island to sell their wares and offer Christmas shoppers loads of inspiration. From festive decorations, clothing, arts and crafts, to flowers, toys and plants \u2013 there is something for everyone.\n\nGourmet food is always a highlight at the F\u00eate - think freshly made gourmet burgers, lamb & mint sausages, wraps, curry, salads, and the ever-popular berries & ice-cream - there is always a huge variety of flavours to tempt the taste buds. Devonshire Teas and home baking served in the Rathkeale Homestead rose garden is a time-honoured tradition while refreshing cold drinks can be sipped on as visitors listen to live music performed by students at various times throughout the day. The popular Christmas cake stall features again this year - but visitors are encouraged to get in early as the cakes often sell out by midday.\n\nThe beauty of this F\u00eate is that it\u2019s a day out for the whole family. In addition to the 120 plus stalls, there is plenty to entertain the children including facepainting and magic shows throughout the day.\n\nVisitors can also explore the beautiful, expansive grounds of Rathkeale College including the school gardens designed by Alfred Buxton, the Greek Amphitheatre and the 3km eco-trail which weaves through large stands of native trees, including ancient kahikatea.\n\nEftpos is available, but we strongly recommend that visitors bring cash.\n\nKoha/gold coin entry.\nRathkeale College is a five-minute drive north of Masterton in the Wairarapa.",

    "description": "Slow Grind Fever [AUS] - Wellington Jazz Festival, Express from Melbourne, Australia and crossing international waters for the first time this October, Meow is excited to welcome the slowest, spookiest, smokiest and swingin-est club night Wellington has ever seen: 'Slow Grind Fever'.\nFor this one-night-only episode of SGF Wellington, founder Richie1250 (106.7 PBS FM) will be joined by fellow Melbourne radio alumnus Dr. Popalotacorn (RRR, 98.1FM Raglan) and Wellington's own belle of the airwaves Miss Juliet (RadioActive.FM Americana)\nSlow Grind Fever was born in 2012 when Richie1250 hired a Russian Cultural Centre ballroom and threw a slow dance party for his 30th birthday, and it's been running as a regular monthly club night ever since. Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

He has had an interest on the impact of social exclusion, alienation and discrimination on mens's wellbeing and advocates for a human rights based, systems change and person-centred approach to wellbeing.The workshop is enriched by the learnings from Barry's own lived experience of depression and suicidality and his pathway to recovery.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to effectively respond to the unacceptably high rate of male suicide in this country.\n\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

Off the back of a monstrous summer, which saw them play 19 shows up and down the country, the pair have spent most of 2025 in the studio finessing their own brand of audio alchemy and preparing to release their label, also named XCOMMUNICATE.\n\nUsually XCOMMUNICATE is a 6 hour journey though decades and sonic realms, however as Heylady is still recovering from a mighty dose of burnout they\u2019ve roped in a couple of their good friends, who happen to be some of Wellington\u2019s finest, to join them as they lay down four hours of four to the floor.\n\nHalo is a mainstay on Wellington dancefloors and it was a no brainer asking her to be on this lineup. A DJ since 2000, she has played festivals across the country and never fails to rock her slot. Her set at Taniwha\u2019s Den last summer was a big highlight and one of the best of the festival. Halo\u2019s ability to drive forward thinking sound and her clever construction of sets are just two reasons you need to be on her floor.\n\nDJ Coda is the godfather of techno in New Zealand. With a career that spans decades, he isn\u2019t just a DJ but a dedicated promoter and one of the trustees of NZ\u2019s longest running student radio station, Radio Active. Part of the COMMUNICATE family from the get go (and a longtime collaborator of Heylady\u2019s), DJ Coda is a master of his craft and never fails to deliver. Armed with knowledge , taste and a hefty love of Detroit, DJ Coda is the man when it comes to rocking the dance floor.\nFirst release tickets are on sale now, grab yours before they are gone and come and dance the evening away with four of the best. We recommend arrive early so you don\u2019t miss out on any of the sets, they are all going to be killer.\n\nIMPORTANT INFO:\nOur event is a safe space for all. If you or someone you know is feeling unsafe or harassed, please approach one of the DJs or bar staff. If you are behaving badly and impacting others ability to have a good time safely, you will be removed. Please act with respect and care for your fellow attendees at all times, no means no and this goes for conversations as well as more intimate requests.\n\n",

A women group embarks on a historic struggle to bring the issue of women's right to vote before the National Constituent Assembly. With bold marches, radio appearances, and a brilliant media strategy that puts them on the front page, they achieve their goal, but the real challenge begins during the debate, where they face fierce opposition. Esmeralda Arboleda must endure personal attacks from the assembly members, and just as she is about to speak, she receives a heartbreaking call: her son has suffered a serious accident. She is torn between her duty as a mother and her commitment to the cause, with an unfavorable outcome. Although all seems to be lost, her perseverance leads to a historic victory when women's suffrage is finally approved, marking a turning point in Colombia's history.\n\n",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

They can be found on Instagram at @thesameerproject.\nMore information:\nJenin Jenin includes testimony from Jenin residents after the Israeli army\u2019s Defensive Shield operation, during which the city and camp were the scenes of fierce fighting. The operation ended with Jenin flattened and scores of Palestinians killed. Palestinians as well as numerous human rights groups accused Israel of committing war crimes in the April 2002 attack on the refugee camp. The sad question forces itself on the spectator: What will become of a country, a people when its children are confronted with war and violence from a very early age?",

We have ordered 500 special trees from the Berhampore Nursery. We are in this for the long haul and a forest that contains a wide range of plant species will, in turn, attract a wider range of birds, lizards, and invertebrates. A wider range of plant species also allows for the forest to naturally regenerate and helps prevent weed species from establishing.\nTools are provided, bring sturdy shoes and a water bottle, Working bees are held every Sunday in June (except June 1st - Kings Birthday Weekend) and August 2025.\nMeeting at the Information Shelter in the Tapu te Ranga Marae car park at the end of Danube Street in Island Bay.

Over half of the country has been liberated by opposition armed groups, but the regime hangs on, using air strikes, forced conscription and brutality to control the main cities and areas of economic value. Amongst the opposition is the punk movement that has led protests, organised Food not Bombs groups, food gardens, social centres and other projects, both inside and outside the country, all run on the smell of an oily rag. Your dollar goes further when it\u2019s in the hands of punks.\n\nWe are screening Linda Linda Linda \u2013 a low-key, cheerful but by no means saccharine, 2005 Japanese film that actually gets punk. It has the same plot as every other rock movie, except this one is believable. Four grumpy teenagers are empowered through a willingness to accept outsiders, music and friendship.\n\nBurmese food from 6pm, a short talk about the situation at 7pm followed by the film.",

Unkovski\u2019s loveable debut, the first ever Macedonian film to be awarded at Sundance.\n\nStill reeling from the death of their mother and wife, Ahmet\u2019s family is broken. His father, struggling to come to terms with being sole provider and caretaker for the family, pulls Ahmet from school so he can care for their flock of sheep; meanwhile, his younger brother has become non-verbal since their mother\u2019s death. Music is both medicine and matchmaker for young Ahmet, who escapes his grief and the grim mundanity of life under his oppressive father by blasting beats from the world\u2019s jankiest stereo system to impress local girl Aya, back from Germany to be betrothed to an older man.\n\nIn this modern-day Romeo and Juliet, the Yuruk mountain village of Kodzalia takes the place of Verona, while the Montagues and Capulets make way for an eclectic support cast, with a technophobic imam, a souped-up tractor and a fluorescent pink sheep all taking the stage. If music be the food of love, then DJ Ahmet is a feast of thumping electro and dance-floor anthems that spur on the teenage protagonist as he fumbles through the throes of his first romance.

H\u00e9ctor is not. When she tells them she\u2019s pregnant, her own parents can\u2019t hide their shock \u2013 loving but concerned that their daughter will be unable to tackle the task of motherhood.

Uncertainty abounds as the due date draws closer, and it\u2019s not just \u00c1ngela\u2019s parents who are beginning to have doubts.\n\nThe foundations for the film\u2019s narrative derive from the personal experiences of first-time actor Miriam Garlo, Libertad\u2019s own sister, as she began to contemplate motherhood as a deaf woman. When surrounded by her other deaf friends, \u00c1ngela is comfortable, alive, vibrant within a community that supports her. Around the local mums in the park, or her husband\u2019s friends, isolation sets in with a painful immediacy that anyone who has ever struggled to understand the language in a foreign country will know all too well.

    "description": "NZIFF: Sex, Returning from last year\u2019s Festival to screen alongside the rest of his Sex Dreams Love trilogy, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s comic drama takes a candid and refreshing look at modern gender roles.\n\nThere has hardly been any investigation on contemporary male identity and sexuality as candid, insightful and hilarious as Norwegian auteur Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Sex. After winning all major laurels in Nordic cinema with his impressive fresco Beware of Children (2019), the acclaimed director and author embarkson an Oslo-set trilogy simply called Sex Dreams Love.\n\nThe first instalment opens on one of the most tantalising and unexpected preludes in recent cinema. Two chimney sweeps frankly open up to each other on a coffee break in their office: the first reveals that he dreamt of being intensely looked at by none other than David Bowie, who was inspecting him as if he was a woman; the other confesses that he recently accepted the sexual advances of a male customer who asked him to have sex with him. But both men are \u201cstraight\u201d and married to women. Here, the deft tone of the film and Haugerud\u2019s rules of the game are immediately set.\n\nA fervent admirer of Eric Rohmer\u2019s thickly scripted skirmishes of love and ethics, the Norwegian writer-director infuses irony, depth and compassion in each of his elegantly composed tableaux depicting how the two men cope with the turmoil these experiences bring to their relationships with their partners and family, but most of all with themselves. Featuring some of the brightest and funniest dialogues of 2024, Sex is a real eye-opener. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

    "description": "NZIFF: Mirrors No. 3, In the wake of a traumatic incident, a young woman forms a surrogate mother-daughter relationship with her rescuer. As emotional walls come down, doubts arise: is there more to the care offered than simple kindness?\n\nLaura and Betty seem to be poles apart. Laura, a young, city dwelling music student, lives in an apartment with her boyfriend; Betty has an adult son and lives alone in rural Germany. Their lives are thrown together after a car accident leaves Laura in the care of the older woman. Despite ostensible differences, each recognises a familiar melancholy in the other. As a tentative trust grows, the women find something unlocking within themselves, even as complicating factors emerge, in the form of Betty\u2019s opaque family situation.\n\nMaster dramatist Christian Petzold reunites with frequent acting collaborator Paula Beer (Transit, Undine, Afire) and regular DOP Hans Fromm, turning his pen and camera to a smaller scale domestic drama. Mirrors No. 3 (named for a Ravel piano piece played within) makes visual and thematic echoes back to Petzold\u2019s previous work: from extended bike rides down rural lanes (Barbara), to the centrality of a piano (Phoenix), as well as the thread of mysterious tension that underlies them all. The film revels in the messy, stimulating complexities of human relationships, exploring the way that sometimes even questionable motivations can affect positive outcomes. \u2014 Jacob Powell",

    "description": "NZIFF: Sentimental Value, This film may touch on the familiar theme of how artists draw from their own lives, but Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgard bring incredible tenderness to a story that is ultimately about what children and parents never say to one another \u2014 and whether those lifelong silences can ever be broken.\nCollaborating again with frequent co-writer Eskil Vogt (now also a successful director), Trier fashions a nuanced look at both a troubled family and a dysfunctional film industry. (Gustav\u2019s comeback project will be distributed through Netflix, and the divisive streamer is the target of a couple of the screenplay\u2019s better barbs.) Much of Sentimental Value takes place in the Borg family\u2019s home, and an efficient flashback, framed as an essay Nora wrote as a girl, explains how they have lived in the house for generations\u2026 That slightly fading family home becomes an apt metaphor for the weathered bond Nora, Agnes and Gustav share, although Reinsve\u2019s fragile performance articulates the festering resentment she feels toward her absent father.\nTrier\u2019s third picture to screen at Cannes, after 2021\u2019s The Worst Person In The World\u2019s breakout lead Reinsve won Best Actress, the reunion of director and star will entice arthouse crowds\u2026 and those seeking a smart, thoughtful tearjerker should be pleased with this sentimental but farfrom-mawkish film.\u201d \u2014 Tom Grierson, Screen Daily",

In the Val-d'Oise region, this community, originally from Turkey and Iraq, has lived since the 1980s in a rhythm marked by weddings, church services, and family meals.\nShaped by the exile of their parents and the persecution their community faced under the Turkish dictatorship and Daesh, S\u00e9miramis nurtures her roots in Assyrian civilization, originating from Mesopotamia. But the puzzle of her history no longer fits together as it once did.\nGradually, the elders are disappearing, taking with them an identity and culture that is 6,000 years old. How can this fracture be repaired, and this heritage preserved? Should they consider staying or returning to their ancestral homeland, now that peace has returned? Can one go back after decades of conflict? Can they rebuild and start anew to live in peace with themselves and others?\n\"Return to Babylon\" is a road movie from Sarcelles to Erbil, following S\u00e9miramis and her family on a journey that leads them to question their future in France and the fate of their community in the Middle East.\nA film by Marie Dault, S\u00e9miramis Ide, and S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nDirected by S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nScreen time: 52-minutes; French and Assyrian with subtitles\nLink to the English-subtitled trailer: https://www.instagram.com/p/DDzsYJzt_B9/\nThe screening event will be held at the Cockburn Street Chapel, 1 Cockburn Street, Kilbirnie, Wellington from 5-7pm.\n\nEntrance is free, but please register to confirm your attendance.\n\nWe welcome koha (donations) which will go towards supporting the ACEYA Wellington Branch's youth-focused activities and events.",

The inclusion of considerable footage from Jacinda's partner Clarke Gayford provides a deeply personal view of life as the Prime Minister in very challenging times.\n(Los Angeles Times review) 'Prime Minister' is not interested in wrangling, dealing and lawmaking, or even the nuts and bolts or her progressive views. .. But in the fleet, pacey manner of the editing, toggling between private and public moments with highlight-reel efficiency, the film is a stirring glimpse of top-down kindness as a winning leadership style.",

In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

The failure and harm caused by the so called 'War on Drugs' is acknowledged globally and witnessed first hand here in Aotearoa New Zealand.\n\nBack in 2011 a comprehensive review of the MoDA conducted by New Zealand Law Commission recommended the MoDA \u201cshould be repealed and replaced by a new Act \u2026administered by the Ministry of Health\u201d.

We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Driftwood from nearby south coast beaches is often abundant, feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page. The less cars driving the better.\nFeel free to share the event page and send an event invite to whomever you feel would be interested, not everyone sees the notifications and advertising ",

Both these structural approaches contribute greatly to the success of your drawing.\n\nGeometric shapes can simplify a subject, unify a drawing and make compositions dynamic. Geometric solids will help render any subject in three dimensions and transition to perspective.\n\nA good working knowledge of the concepts of perspective will help you draw any subject with correct dimensionality. It can also help in your realist drawing, painting and invented subjects and environments. These concepts are also used in most two dimensional art because it enables us to realise great spatial effects, making it an invaluable tool to add to your skill set.\n\n8 x weekly morning or afternoon sessions.

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods. Her works have appeared in the Politics, International Politics, Political Science, PS: Political Science & Politics, Journal of Contemporary China, Pacific Review, and Asian Security.\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 04:30 PM - 05:30 PM\nWelcome reception with refreshments and light catering\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 06:30 PM\nKeynote address: Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal Intern\nHost: Christina Lai\n\n\n",

The inclusion of considerable footage from Jacinda's partner Clarke Gayford provides a deeply personal view of life as the Prime Minister in very challenging times.\n(Los Angeles Times review) 'Prime Minister' is not interested in wrangling, dealing and lawmaking, or even the nuts and bolts or her progressive views. ..

    "description": "Exploring our Shared Humanity, Do you ever feel that you're just going through the motions? That life is a series of tasks, a pursuit of pleasure, or a race for self-improvement that never really satisfies? This isn't just a feeling; it's a fundamental human question about what it means to exist.\n\nDescription\nJoin experienced psychotherapist Rohit Grover for a six-week course that invites you to look beyond the surface of everyday life. In these two-hour sessions, we will explore the core tenets of existential therapy, moving away from the conventional focus on self and hedonism. Instead, we'll grapple with life's big questions:\n\nWhat does it truly mean to live a value-driven life?\nDo our personal values matter, or is the search for meaning just an illusion?\nWhat is the \"being\" part of \"human being\" all about?\n\nThrough guided discussions, reflective exercises, and insights from classic existential thinkers, Rohit will help you navigate this profound territory. This isn't about finding easy answers. It's about developing the courage to ask the right questions, to confront the realities of freedom, responsibility, and meaning, and to discover a more authentic way of living.\n\nThis course is for anyone ready to step off the treadmill and begin a deeper exploration of what it means to be alive. Come and find out what it means to truly exist\n\nUpon completion of this course, participants will be able to:\n\nDifferentiate between a life driven by external pressures or fleeting pleasures and one rooted in personal values and authentic meaning.\n\nIdentify and critically examine the core existential givens of human existence, such as freedom, responsibility, isolation, and the search for meaning.\n\nArticulate a personal understanding of what it means to \"be\" a human being, moving beyond a purely functional or biological definition.\n\nArrive at sensing rather than thinking. Sensing this existence, this dance of life. Widen your view of existence.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".",

By immersing yourself in the healing vibrations of the gongs, you can tap into a deeper sense of relaxation and rejuvenation.\nWhether you're looking to unwind after a long day or explore new avenues of self-care, this 1-hour gong bath offers a unique opportunity to reconnect with yourself and find balance amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life. There will be cups of tea available afterwards to help us integrate and ground\n**THIS EVENT IS RESTRICTED TO 20 PEOPLE ONLY**\nDisclaimer\nGong baths are safe and supportive for most people. However, please consult your doctor or mental health professional before attending if you:\n-have a pacemaker or other implanted medical device\n-live with epilepsy or a sound-sensitive condition\n-are in the first trimester of pregnancy\n-are experiencing severe or unmanaged mental health challenges (such as psychosis, schizophrenia, or PTSD)\nIf you have recent injuries, surgeries, or other health concerns, let me know so we can make sure you\u2019re comfortable.\nEveryone responds differently to sound. If at any point during the session you feel overwhelmed or uncomfortable, you are welcome to sit up, move gently, or step outside. Your wellbeing always comes first.\nAbout Me\nErika is a musician and astrologer based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. She has 30+ years musical experience. Erika has an interest in the healing properties of sound for mental and physical wellbeing, which she currently explores through her gong bathing practice",

We will then guide participants in somatic practices to offer accessible ways to reconnect with your agency.\nDuring this session, you will gain tools to increase your inner awareness, expand your bandwidth of awareness, and integrate emotion, sensation, and story. Together we\u2019ll explore the role of perception in our orientation to life and the choices we make, how our narratives can connect us with our agency, the power of curiosity, and dive into how our relational presence can often have more impact than our opinions.\nThis session is an invitation to restore connection, calm, and courage, to become more whole, more fully human, and more ready for what this moment is asking of us.\nAbout your host\nFreda is a curator, engagement practitioner, and connector, who works at the intersection of social change, community-building, and inner development. She is the Founder of the Goodlife Collective, which curates spaces that build connection, wellbeing and collective wisdom.\nDrawing on yoga teaching, somatic practices and adult development, Freda is interested in how we build our inner infrastructure - the capacity to work through discomfort, reconnect with our agency, and bring greater presence to relationships. Her background is in psychology, environmental-science and design, and she loves nerding out on ideas and conversations about unlocking our collective potential.",

    "description": "Katie Knowles PAM, Title:\nSelf-Disclosure of Sexual Dysfunction to Romantic Partners.\n\nAbstract:\nSexual dysfunctions (e.g., distress about levels of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain) are linked with poorer individual and relational wellbeing. Disclosing these dysfunctions to a romantic partner helps to mitigate these effects, however, such disclosures also risk rejection or relationship conflict. Existing models of disclosure do not adequately capture the complexities of disclosing sexual dysfunction, such as how costs and benefits are weighed simultaneously, the role of contextual factors, or how partner responses shape future disclosures. Three studies test a model of people\u2019s disclosure of sexual dysfunction. Study 1 reports a thematic analysis of people\u2019s social scripts about disclosing sexual dysfunction. Subsequent studies will test the influence of positive and negative partner responses and develop a scale to measure the anticipated costs and benefits of disclosing dysfunctions. Altogether, these studies build a framework explaining how and when people will disclose sexual dysfunction to romantic partners.\nPrimary supervisor: Dr Matt Hammond\nSecond supervisor: Dr Ally Gibson\nStaff and postgraduate students are cordially invited to attend. There will be an opportunity at the end of the presentation for audience to observe the panel questioning the candidate about the presentation and proposed research, and for audience members themselves to ask questions of the candidate.\n",

    "description": "Folk B*tch Trio - Wellington, Folk Bitch Trio - 'Now Would Be A Good Time' Album Tour with special guest Georgia Knight\n\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories. Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology",

Whether you are single or partnered, whether your past experiences were harmonious or painful, each relationship reflects the inner dance of the masculine and feminine within us.\n\nThroughout history, these sacred energies\u2014Yin and Yang\u2014were meant to complement and support each other. Yet, distortions, suppression, and separation have created wounds that echo through generations. Many of us carry beliefs such as:\n\nMen cannot be trusted.\nWomen are not safe.\nLove must be earned.\n......\n\nRarely do we pause to sit with these wounds and meet the unhealed parts of our inner feminine and masculine. These energies may hold not only personal pain but also ancestral imprints passed down through time\u2014shaping the way we experience love and connection today.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f In this mini workshop, you will be guided through a shamanic journey to explore and heal your inner archetypes. Together, we will:\n\n\u2728 Release old wounds and limiting patterns carried by the inner feminine or masculine.\n\u2728 Make peace with the shadow side of our psyche.\n\u2728 Embody the wholeness of the Divine Masculine and Feminine within.\n\nWe will close our circle with a sacred forgiveness ritual, bridging the separation and returning to a state of balance, wholeness, and love.\n\nThis journey is open to everyone\u2014whether you are new to shamanic work or have walked this path before. All that is required is an open heart and willingness to connect deeply within.\n\n\ud83c\udf38 You\u2019ll leave with:\n\nA renewed sense of love and harmony within yourself.\nGreater balance between your inner masculine and feminine.\nA deeper connection to spirit, self, and the essence of oneness.\n\nEvent Details\n\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, September 21st\n\ud83d\udd52 3:00\u20136:00 pm\n\ud83d\udccd Lotus Yoga Centre \u2013 Sanctuary, Paraparaumu\n\ud83d\udcab Energy Exchange: $55 per person\n\ud83c\udf3f Limited to 12 participants\n\n\u2728What to bring:\nA water bottle, journal, cushion or blanket for comfort.\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Rides from Wellington may be arranged\u2014please contact me if needed.Contact: 0272541272\n\nAbout Your Guide - Fery Qiu\n\nI am a Shamanic Healer who is committed to the healing path that help people heal from the core of their being. From suicidal depression to shamanic path, my spirituality is not based on how many trainings, meditations, and ceremonies I have done, it\u2019s coming from a deep embodied experience to transform pain into wisdom and empowerment. The shamanic path is a way of being; we allow ourselves to go deeper within to connect all things that come from oneness. I loved my work, which has been proven to help people really change their lives. If you are curious about what this mini workshop could bring, having an open mind and open heart, you will be surprised by how much can be done just in this brief journey within.\n\n\n\nWith love,\nFery Qiu\n\n",

When we connect to our inner foundations, we touch the support of those who came before and deepen our sense of belonging to life itself.\nWe\u2019ll begin with ceremonial cacao, then drop into a guided movement journey with live soundscape. There are no steps to learn, no performance\u2014just presence, curiosity, and letting your body move as it feels. Barefoot and phone-free, you\u2019re invited to drop deep into free-form movement, awakening parts of you that you may have forgotten.\nCome as you are.\nMove with what you feel.\nLeave feeling empowered, connected, and alive.\nSomatic dance is a guided movement practice that helps you tune into your body\u2019s wisdom and move from the inside out. Unlike ecstatic dance, which is typically an open, DJ-led space with no facilitation, somatic dance offers gentle guidance to support you in exploring sensation, emotion, and embodiment in a safe, intentional way. You\u2019re not learning steps or performing\u2014you're being invited into presence, curiosity, and feeling. With a focus on nervous system regulation, personal expression, and inner listening, somatic dance creates a nurturing space to come home to yourself.\nYour Hosts...\nJenna Joan | Embodiment Facilitator\nJenna Joan is a somatic therapist, yoga teacher, and group facilitator who has been leading movement spaces for over 15 years. With a background in yoga, somatic dance, and therapeutic embodiment, her work blends play, authenticity, and deep nervous system awareness. Jenna is also a cacao alchemist and ceremonial facilitator, known for creating safe, soulful spaces that invite freedom, connection, and inner exploration. She has been hosting workshops, retreats, and community events for nearly a decade, and also works 1:1 in more therapeutic settings.\nSonic Sutra | Somatic Dance DJ\nSonic Sutra is a sound artist and somatic dance DJ who creates immersive musical journeys designed to support authentic movement, emotional release, and deep embodiment. With a focus on somatic dance and therapeutic soundscapes, their sets are intentionally curated to guide dancers through an inner experience\u2014honouring the body\u2019s natural rhythms and the intelligence within. Their offerings create safe, accessible spaces for people of all bodies, backgrounds, and experience levels to explore movement, presence, and connection. Rooted in play, precision, and deep listening, Sonic Sutra brings music that moves beyond entertainment\u2014into healing and transformation.",

    "description": "Teaching Well - Supportive schools for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), With the growing emphasis on staff wellbeing there is a plethora of workplace mental wellbeing programmes on offer. However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages. In fact, the staff consultation is, in itself, is a wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops.

Most props are provided but feel free to bring your own yoga mat for extra comfort as well as a cushion, blanket, socks and an eye pillow if you have one.\n\nThis class is suitable for all - no previous experience is required.\n\nLIMITED SPACES AVAILABLE.\nTWILIGHT SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/5a2pad44\nMORNING SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/mw82z38u\n\nRestorative yoga is a practice of deep relaxation in which yoga poses (asanas) are held for several minutes with the use of props such as blocks, bolster and blankets to support the body in gentle stretch.\n\nWhen your body enters a state of relaxation, your mind will also relax. Once you have been guided to let go of any tension held in your body, all that is required is for you to pay attention to your breath, becoming aware of any thoughts that may arise, and then gently releasing them.\n\nThis restful practice calms both mind and body, allowing the nervous system to enter its parasympathetic state \u2013 the state of \u201crest and digest\u201d, in which healing is enabled and enhanced.\n\nAbout Cacao\nCacao is a superfood. It is plant medicine at its finest. Its scientific name, Theobroma cacao, translates to \"food of the Gods.\" Containing many minerals, vitamins and phytonutrients such as flavonoids and antioxidants, it is also an extremely potent adaptogen that encourages the body to come into balance.\n\nCacao has a particularly strong influence on the heart \u2013 both physiologically and energetically. Cacao anecdotally is reported to enhance connection in community, hence its beauty in being shared in circle.\n\nIn Jenny's experience, cacao seems to enhance whatever it is that you are doing \u2013 be it running a marathon or meditating \u2013 cacao can make you go deeper, further, longer, stronger. However she does seem to have a mind of her own so be open to the experience she offers you \u2013 it may not always go quite how you planned!\n\nCacao is very safe and tolerated well by most people. However it is to be used with caution by people who are taking high doses of SSRIs. Cacao releases serotonin, so it works as a mild antidepressant. When taken with SSRIs that release serotonin chemically it can lead to serotonin syndrome. Individuals taking MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should avoid consuming ceremonial cacao due to potential interactions.\n\nThis workshop is part of Pukerua Bay Hub's 2025 Pop-up Parlour - thanks for your support.\n\n____________________________________\nWHAT IS THE POP-UP PARLOUR?\nA chance to create and connect in our pop-up community space. From 1-30 September we've got a jam-packed schedule with 65+ events for kids, families, rangatahi and adults to learn, hang out and have fun.\n\nCheck out all the free/koha events too -\nhttps://www.pkbhub.org.nz/whatson\n\nWaiho i te toipoto, kaua i te toi roa \u2013\nLet us keep close together, not far apart.\n\n",

The group has been running for more than a decade and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers that come along for particular books or simply when it suits. We meet on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nOur October book is Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly. The work changed American hearts and minds about slavery.\n\nThe influence of Uncle Tom's Cabin was so immense that the story arose that when Abraham Lincoln welcomed Stowe to the White House during the American Civil War he reportedly declared, \"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\"\n\nIn the US, it was the best-selling novel of the 19th century and the second best-selling book of all after the Bible.\n\nProject Gutenberg link for those e-reading:\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/203\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place. After you enter the bar, head to your right (up the step) and through a smaller space with booths to the large carpeted space beyond.",

As we continue our exploration of Dmitri Shostakovich's journey 50 years after his death, we present his fourth symphony. The work, was meant to be his boldest statement yet \u2014 but the composer withdrew it before its premiere. Why? The whispers were clear: this music would not please the authorities. It stayed hidden for decades, a secret too dangerous to share.\nWe partner with At The World's Edge Music Festival (AWE) to present the stunning talents of soloists Benjamin Baker (violin) and Yura Lee (viola) in a performance of Mozart\u2019s luminous Sinfonia Concertante. This work offers a moment of balance \u2014 a conversation between violin and viola, full of warmth and understanding, reminding us of beauty even in troubled times.\nWith generous support from the Orchestra Wellington Foundation we also reveal a brand-new secret: the world premiere of \"House of the Faun\" by WIlliam Philipson, the 2025 SOUNZ Commission for Orchestra and Sistema Youth Orchestra | Te Tono Mahinga a SOUNZ m\u0101 te R\u0101ngi Puoro me te R\u0101ngi Puoro Taiohi a Sistema. The work is designed to showcase the young musicians of Arohanui Strings+ by setting their playing against the full orchestra in a rich and immersive musical landscape. ",

Learn ways to resolve conflict with customers and co workers, influence successful outcomes and develop a peaceful workplace. We have all experienced the stress that comes from having unresolved conflicts with our customers and co-workers. Conflicts that are ignored or resolved poorly don\u2019t go away, they cause people to feel resentful and to avoid each other.

Key Learning Outcomes: - Transform conflict into opportunity - Develop constructive strategies for dealing with difficult behaviour - Develop communication skills to diffuse the situation - Increase confidence and assertiveness in dealing with difficult behaviour - Manage your emotions and deal with stress - Understand the power of words and how to use them to your advantage Workshop Overview: - What are the behaviours that we find difficult to deal with? - Develop an understanding of how flight or fight reactions prompt difficult behaviour - Controlling your reactions and choosing how you respond - Strategies for staying calm and keeping your cool when dealing with difficult behaviour - How attitudes play a part \u2013 What\u2019s it like being on the receiving end of me?

The winner of the Golden Bear 2025 is a lucid and tender chronicle of the unforgettable experience of first love.\n\nOriginally intended as the second chapter in his trilogy and released in Norway as such, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Dreams ended up premiering internationally as the last. But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

    "description": "Intro to 2D Traditional Animation, This is a beginners course in 2D animation where you'll learn the time-honoured principles of hand-drawn animation and how to apply them to your own animation project. You may work on a project incorporating your own ideas, or if you'd rather, an assigned a project from your tutor.\n\nYour tutor, Ross Payne, is a 30-year veteran of traditional 2D animation, and loves to share his knowledge about it for you to love it as much as he does.\n\nIn each lesson there will be examples and demonstrations of the animation principles with follow up exercises to put your new skills into practice. You'll work on your project both during class and at home, applying the animation principles to your individualised project.\n\nYou can choose to draw your animation on paper then scan/capture into your device, or choose to draw your animation digitally, directly into an animation programme. whichever you choose instructions in class will be provided to give you the skills needed for this step.\n\nYou can use any device, ipad or laptop you already own (except a mobile \u2013 it's really not big enough to do good animation on). The school does not provide any digital equipment. It's important that the app/programme is installed on the student's device before the course begins, and that they have had a play on it to get used to how it works. This is so that the student is at least a little familiar with their chosen software so that it's enough to begin learning animation techniques on day one. Additional information found at our website.\n\nRoss will advise you on a variety of animation apps/programmes available online to use, ranging in price from free to not very much. Note - A computer mouse can be used for 2D animation, but digital pens are much easier to use. Prior to the course commencing, you'll receive details of recommended programmes to use for the course.\n\nSuitable for a range of ages, from teens to adults.\n\nTuesday evenings, 14 October - 2 December, 6:30-8:30 pm",

A suitcase full of songs. A guitar by the table. A heart full of cities.\n\nAs always, free entry & all pizzas $15!",

I moved to beautiful Aotearoa from Sweden a few years ago, and my journey with ceramics started in 2023 and I've been elbows deep in clay ever since. I use flora found all over the world, and outside my doorsteps, to shape my artwork. My ceramic pieces are all hand made and no piece will be the other alike. I mainly throw a shape on the wheel and then let it tell me what it wants to become.\nThis exhibition is guided by Ecclesiastes 3:1-11. I think life is beautiful in it's times of joy, but also in the times of struggle, where we can grow and learn.\nA Time for Everything\nThere is a time for everything,\nand a season for every activity under the heavens:\na time to be born and a time to die,\na time to plant and a time to uproot,\na time to kill and a time to heal,\na time to tear down and a time to build,\na time to weep and a time to laugh,\na time to mourn and a time to dance,\na time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,\na time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,\na time to search and a time to give up,\na time to keep and a time to throw away,\na time to tear and a time to mend,\na time to be silent and a time to speak,\na time to love and a time to hate,\na time for war and a time for peace.\nWhat do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.\n",

    "description": "Teaching Well - Supportive schools for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), With the growing emphasis on staff wellbeing there is a plethora of workplace mental wellbeing programmes on offer. However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages. In fact, the staff consultation is, in itself, is a wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 30% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions.

His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs. \nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.

He wrote the first national guidelines for suicide prevention in Australian schools and undertook a review of the NZ guidelines.\nAs a Health Sociologist and Public Health practitioner, Barry has a long-term interest in the social and cultural determinants of wellbeing, especially the role of gender and he brings a wealth of knowledge and passion for promoting wellbeing in men. He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing. He uses a population health and systems change approach, drawing on transformational change theory and collective impact.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to promote well wh\u0101nau, workplaces and communities and for the incorporation of wellbeing principles in public policy and social outcomes such as education, training and employment.\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

    "description": "NZIFF: DJ Ahmet, Ahmet stumbles upon a forest rave at the edge of his local village, where he finds the escape he\u2019s been desperately seeking in Georgi M. Unkovski\u2019s loveable debut, the first ever Macedonian film to be awarded at Sundance.\n\nStill reeling from the death of their mother and wife, Ahmet\u2019s family is broken. His father, struggling to come to terms with being sole provider and caretaker for the family, pulls Ahmet from school so he can care for their flock of sheep; meanwhile, his younger brother has become non-verbal since their mother\u2019s death. Music is both medicine and matchmaker for young Ahmet, who escapes his grief and the grim mundanity of life under his oppressive father by blasting beats from the world\u2019s jankiest stereo system to impress local girl Aya, back from Germany to be betrothed to an older man.\n\nIn this modern-day Romeo and Juliet, the Yuruk mountain village of Kodzalia takes the place of Verona, while the Montagues and Capulets make way for an eclectic support cast, with a technophobic imam, a souped-up tractor and a fluorescent pink sheep all taking the stage. If music be the food of love, then DJ Ahmet is a feast of thumping electro and dance-floor anthems that spur on the teenage protagonist as he fumbles through the throes of his first romance. A jubilant first feature and a real charmer. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

    "description": "Make Some Noise - choral music that matters, After a successful performance of Mozart\u2019s classic Requiem in D Minor in May, Supertonic is back with a programme of contemporary choral music that matters. \nOn the evening of Saturday 8 November, Supertonic will present Make Some Noise at the Lower Hutt Town Hall. This is the first time the choir has performed in the Hutt Valley, and they hope to see some new faces in the audience as they bring this programme of  meaningful music from around the world to the stage.  \nMake Some Noise highlights issues of social justice, including indigenous, women\u2019s and civil rights and climate action. The programme is rich and varied, from Katerina Gimon\u2019s arrangement of AURORA\u2019s Apple Tree, a Norwegian pop song addressing the urgency of the global climate crisis, to Robert T. Gibson\u2019s arrangement of the gospel standard This Little Light of Mine. Oliassa by Malika Tirolien utilises an invented language to invoke a call from the ancestors, while Alex Vollant titles their piece Auass meaning \u201cchild\u201d in the Innu language to honour the generation of elders who survived the Residential Schools in Canada. The impact of sexual harassment and assault on women is highlighted in MILCK\u2019s I Can\u2019t Keep Quiet  and Lillia Ruocco and Emmanuelle Ader\u2019s Canzone r\u00f2 curtiell\u2019. Closer to home, Make Some Noise features a set of waiata in teo reo M\u0101ori to highlight the importance of indigenous voices in Aotearoa New Zealand, including Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s Whakarongo. This waiata-\u0101-ringa incorporates Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s beliefs and methodology on teaching te reo M\u0101ori.   \nLed by co-Musical Director Virginie Pacheco, Supertonic offers Make Some Noise as an invitation to concert-goers to consider the causes that are important to them. In connecting with audiences through the striking and impactful works of the composers featured in this programme - by turns harmonious, raucous, gut-wrenching, resolute - the choir hopes to inspire those listening to make some noise in their own lives. \nSupertonic was formed in 2014 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and strives to  push the boundaries of what choral music can be. The choir has performed concerts that cover the entire musical spectrum, from major classical works including Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Vivaldi's Gloria and Faure's Requiem to pop and rock spectaculars celebrating hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s from the likes of Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Elton John, Queen, and Celine Dion. The choir has performed alongside The Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, joined Brett McKenzie, the NZSO and The Muppets for the Jim Henson Retrospectacle,  shared the stage with Mama Kin Spender at Coastella, and performed in national civic commemorations, street festivals and at community events.",

They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Pacific style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and effective insights. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from different communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from Together in Dialogue?\nIn Together in Dialogue, you will share meaningful conversations around Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the role and responsibilities of Pasifika as allies. By engaging in deep talanoa, you will explore cultural, historical, and contemporary implications of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and how Pasifika people can strengthen this unique relationship and promote cultural awareness.\nThis is a 3.5 hour in-person learning experience. The day will begin with a P\u014dwhiri, to welcome you into the space.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\nFacilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives.

Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\nStephen Gallagher\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\nDavid Long\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\nJules Desmond\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\nOghum\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\nJess Chambers\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration.

You will laugh, but not enough to hurt your side or upset your neighbor.

    "description": "Folk Bitch Trio \u2013 Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Folk Bitch Trio \u2013 Te Whanganui-a-Tara\nFolk Bitch Trio - 'Now Would Be A Good Time' Album Tour\nwith special guest Georgia Knight\n\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories. Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology.\n\n",

The album drops 19 September on streaming & vinyl.\n\nNever overblown or overproduced, Dreams That Feel Like Falling is direct and intimate. 11 tracks of warmth, sincerity and brashness that strike a balance of breeze and overdrive.\n\nTo celebrate the release, Cowboy Dan are heading out for a run of shows throughout Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui in September and October.\n\nThis Te Whanganui-a-Tara will be the second outing in the capital for Cowboy Dan, who are delighted to bring Echo Children along for the ride from T\u0101maki to share their special tunes and infectous harmoines, along with Te Whanganui-a-Tara local legends Search For Yeti...STACKED!\n\nOnce aptly described as The Bats on the right amount of Red Bull, Cowboy Dan has been treating audiences across the motu to energetic, emotionally charged tunes since 2015. Their live shows have consistently delivered good times to fans and new friends alike.\n\nOff the back of two delightful EPs: We Will Hesitate, When We Eventually Wait (2017, Mixed by Jonathan Pearce); Sentimental Now That We're Leaving (2021, Mixed by Rohan Evans), the debut LP, Dreams That Feel Like Falling, is a continuation and a few steps forward, showcasing the bands expansive sonic pallet, with a mix of distortion, introspection, heart and bite.\n\nSearch For Yeti draws from a deep range of influences to create a sound that achieves the difficult feat of being hugely atmospheric and diverse while also being hook laden. This is an act that captures people with their onstage energy \u2014 and gets them talking afterwards about the songs that they just heard.\n\nFollowing in the long tradition of innovative Aotearoa indie bands, Echo Children craft a distinctive sound by melding psychedelic pop harmonies with sharp alt-country songwriting.\n\nGather your pals and get ready for good times! A thursday, sure, but what a chance to digest some upbeat goodness hailing from the big smoke and with some local goodness to boot.\n\n",

MESSIE\u2019s sets are guaranteed to be bootleg heavy with something for everyone as she draws from her own music taste of rap and grime, to early 2000\u2019s singalongs, girl-boss anthems and queer music culture in the form of edits you\u2019d never expect.\n\nAlongside her headline tour around Aotearoa in mid 2024, MESSIE has now brought her fresh, high-energy club music internationally to Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, R&V, Beyond The Valley, Wildlands, Love Saves The Day, Gemfest & Outro Festival. With slots at Pohoda Festival, Hidden Festival, Motion, Truck Festival, AIASOUND and All Points East already this year, there is no slowing her down.",

From local music students to top-notch international artists we\u2019ve seen it all.\nIt\u2019s a huge milestone - 20 years of high quality music played by a massive variety of talented people.\nThe exciting programme is largely finalised and is pasted below.\nMark the date!\nTable bookings 04 974 2207 or info.therealm@nzvenueco.nz or therealm.co.nz and click on \u2018book a table\u2019\nGreat ambience, good company, superb kai and stellar music.

This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\n",

The Magnificat is a world favourite, arguably Bach's best choral piece that has transcended the ages, celebrating Luke's description of Mary's pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, the choir and orchestra perform Ritchie's Then I Understood. When a child of seven to nine, Laura Rangers sketched eight poems centred on summers at Otaki Beach, Ritchie seized the opportunity to add the musical dimension and the result are dual choirs - the Renaissance Singers split - accompanied by the Sinfonia to set off Rangers' delightful insights, so elegantly displayed. The magic that can be childhood.\n\nThe concert has a celebratory theme, it being the 50th anniversary of the choir. Thus the inclusion of Forrest's Three Nocturnes that express the wonderment involved when examining the heavens and the universe full of stars. Throughout this piece the percussionists alone from the Sinfonia provide whimsical accompaniment with a celeste providing the heavenly tones - a hit when played on the last occasion the choir sang the piece.\n\nOpening the concert will be Carl Orff's O Fortuna from his popular Carmina Burana. While O Fortuna laments the role of fate it is set in the larger piece that celebrates life with gusto.\n\nWith the performers in great form (two choristers just back from singing with the world's best choir) this concert will no doubt build the sense of celebration - full of life and wonderment.\n\nGeneral Admission $25, Concession $20, Secondary School $15,\nUnder 13 Free.\n\n",

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience. As she continues to evolve as an artist, Araiyah\u2019s music promises to touch the hearts of many, leaving a lasting impact on all who have the privilege of listening.\n\nAraiyah will be accompanied by guitarist Izzy and Laura Chester-Murphy on percussion.\n\nRain and the Urban Bohemians:\n\nFormed around the music of singer-songwriter Cathy Elizabeth aka Rain, supported by her band of Urban Bohemians, this group has been able to weave together many different influences and styles to create something quite unique and beautiful.\n\nPeppered with contemplations of our existence and the fleetingness of time, Rain & the UBs bring the magic with a folk-rock edge and an alluring authenticity at its centre. Spiritual undertones and overtones give way to an uplifting joyfulness, of triumph over difficulties and life lessons learned and expressed through music.\n\nWith Cathy Elizabeth on vocals & acoustic guitar, Chris Ewers on bass, Murray James on drums and Izzy and Dion on guitars, these guys have got the goods and are ready to deliver!\n\nSo come along and allow yourself to be immersed and transported, moved and entertained.

It draws inspiration from urban isolation and the weight of expectations. Tracks from the EP have landed on major Spotify and Apple playlists. Reflecting the office environment, familiar to many, this performance will bring to life the themes from the EP in a host of ways.\n\nWith over 2.2 million streams across platforms and 1.8 million on Spotify alone, his impact is growing. Releases have landed on global and regional editorial playlists. His EPs\u2014Fantasy, Monarch, SugarCoated and now F.O.M.O \u2014have consistently showcased his range and evolution as an artist.\n\nSig Wilder & Friends blend kiwi authenticity with American grit, bringing you a well-worn handwritten journal of lived experiences rendered through metaphor, poetic prose, and the stylistic conventions of folk, alt-country and late-night heartbreak radio.\n\nJosh Glennie is a soulful singer/songwriter based in Wellington, New Zealand. He's made a name for himself playing in bands around Wellington and is now striking out with his own solo material. Together with Tarn, they have produced a new EP of songs that cut to the bone, focused around acoustic guitar and Josh's striking vocals. His New EP is expected late 2025/early 2026.\n\n",

Next up is local producer, musician and songwriter Phil Riley, followed by a good 50 mins of toe-tapping grooving with The Grey Dog Band.\n\nMore about the artists:\n\nRachel Hird is a Wellington based singer-songwriter. She grew up playing the piano and studying classical music. Nowadays she writes and performs her own songs, best described as \u2018songs from the heart'. She is constantly inspired by people she meets in the world of music such as musician, vocalist, songwriter and mentor Brenda Shearer, and sing-songwriter Charlotte Yates whose songwriting school is a place where many songs have been crafted. Rachel's songs are inspired by people, places and events of the past and present. She is planning an EP release early 2026.\n\nPhil Riley is a full-time writer /producer with a recording studio in Korokoro. He's a wordsmith and melodic songwriter with influences from the Beatles and Paul Simon to Coldplay. Phil started on the English Club circuit as a guitarist, then drummer and keyboard player/singer in NZ bands.\nRiley got to know Grammy winner Jon Mark of White Cloud Records (Naxos), and this led to a series of 6 Celtic and World music albums for the label, including The Blessing Tree, which reached #11 on the US radio play charts and was nominated for 5 NZ Tui music awards.\n\nRiley has tracks on European and US albums alongside artists such as Enya, Sarah McLachlan, Sinead O\u2019Connor, Secret Garden and Clannad. The compilation \u2018Celtic Journey\u2019 reached #1 on the American Billboard charts.\n\nOver the past few years, the art and craft of songwriting has become a priority, driving his recording and performing focus and moving his musical centre of gravity. His first \u2019new\u2019 indie album \u2018Five Dollar Rockets\u2019 featured a stellar cast of instrumentalists and singers.\nIn this unplugged \u2018sneak preview\u2019 of songs from the first and upcoming second album he\u2019ll be joined by long-time talented music buddies Charlie Harter and Marty Parlane on guitars and the wonderful Brenda Shearer on vocals.\n\nThe Grey Dog are a deluded bunch of cork-sniffers who think they will improve with age.

They often play around Courtenay Place, where they use their music to lure passing sailors to their doom. Their musical style is wide-ranging, but basically Boomer. They hope their music will provide some fuel for your hearts, heads, and toes.\n\nThe Realm is a family friendly venue with a great vibe, good food, including children's menu and a good range of refreshing beverages available at the bar.

Once you have been guided to let go of any tension held in your body, all that is required is for you to pay attention to your breath, becoming aware of any thoughts that may arise, and then gently releasing them.\n\nThis restful practice calms both mind and body, allowing the nervous system to enter its parasympathetic state \u2013 the state of \u201crest and digest\u201d, in which healing is enabled and enhanced.\n\nAbout Cacao\nCacao is a superfood. It is plant medicine at its finest. Its scientific name, Theobroma cacao, translates to \"food of the Gods.\" Containing many minerals, vitamins and phytonutrients such as flavonoids and antioxidants, it is also an extremely potent adaptogen that encourages the body to come into balance.\n\nCacao has a particularly strong influence on the heart \u2013 both physiologically and energetically. Cacao anecdotally is reported to enhance connection in community, hence its beauty in being shared in circle.\n\nIn Jenny's experience, cacao seems to enhance whatever it is that you are doing \u2013 be it running a marathon or meditating \u2013 cacao can make you go deeper, further, longer, stronger. However she does seem to have a mind of her own so be open to the experience she offers you \u2013 it may not always go quite how you planned!\n\nCacao is very safe and tolerated well by most people. However it is to be used with caution by people who are taking high doses of SSRIs. Cacao releases serotonin, so it works as a mild antidepressant. When taken with SSRIs that release serotonin chemically it can lead to serotonin syndrome. Individuals taking MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should avoid consuming ceremonial cacao due to potential interactions.\n\nThis workshop is part of Pukerua Bay Hub's 2025 Pop-up Parlour - thanks for your support.\n\n____________________________________\nWHAT IS THE POP-UP PARLOUR?\nA chance to create and connect in our pop-up community space. From 1-30 September we've got a jam-packed schedule with 65+ events for kids, families, rangatahi and adults to learn, hang out and have fun.\n\nCheck out all the free/koha events too -\nhttps://www.pkbhub.org.nz/whatson\n\nWaiho i te toipoto, kaua i te toi roa \u2013\nLet us keep close together, not far apart.\n\n",

Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.\nAs Glinda\u2019s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba\u2019s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives.\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

It draws inspiration from urban isolation and the weight of expectations. Tracks from the EP have landed on major Spotify and Apple playlists. Reflecting the office environment, familiar to many, this performance will bring to life the themes from the EP in a host of ways.\n\nWith over 2.2 million streams across platforms and 1.8 million on Spotify alone, his impact is growing. Releases have landed on global and regional editorial playlists. His EPs\u2014Fantasy, Monarch, SugarCoated and now F.O.M.O \u2014have consistently showcased his range and evolution as an artist.\n\nSig Wilder & Friends blend kiwi authenticity with American grit, bringing you a well-worn handwritten journal of lived experiences rendered through metaphor, poetic prose, and the stylistic conventions of folk, alt-country and late-night heartbreak radio.\n\nJosh Glennie is a soulful singer/songwriter based in Wellington, New Zealand. He's made a name for himself playing in bands around Wellington and is now striking out with his own solo material. Together with Tarn, they have produced a new EP of songs that cut to the bone, focused around acoustic guitar and Josh's striking vocals. His New EP is expected late 2025/early 2026.\n\n",

    "description": "the Jesus Lizard, After initially calling it a day in 1999, the Jesus Lizard officially return full time to save us from the current state of musical mediocrity with their latest album, Rack. A blistering resurgence of the so-called \u2018noise rock\u2019 they helped define alongside contemporaries Big Black, Flipper, The Birthday Party, with their previous and most noted albums Head, Goat and Liar. For those of us who live in fear of the reunion album and subsequent tour, the Jesus Lizard thankfully display not only the same chaotic and dark nihilism of their earlier careers but also the maturity and seasoning of a band riding a wave of renewed and reinvigorated form.\n\nOnce slated by famed engineer Steve Albini as \u201cthe greatest band I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019 the Jesus Lizard not only lived up to this lofty praise in their prime but continue to do so in their advancing years. David Yow still leads the charge as the maniacally possessed frontman entering crowds with reckless abandon and a stamina that much younger vocalists would kill for. The original rhythm section of David Wm Sims and Mac McNeilly further continue to prove why they were and are the best bass & drum combo since Jones and Bonham, anchoring the ship as Captain Yow and first mate Denison navigate the wild seas of their songs. And while he may not always feature (as he rightly should) on many modern music journalists \u2018best guitarists lists\u2019, Duane Denison could perhaps be the most innovative and idiosyncratic punk rock guitarist EVER. However, each member is a sum of their parts but combined they are as Albini also once said \u201cthe purest melding of the sublime and profane.\u201d\n\nWhether you are a longtime disciple of the Jesus Lizard, seeing them when last here in \u201898, or perhaps your fandom is more recent and have only seen videos of their legendary live performances, you will know that these shows are not to be missed.\n\nSaturday 11th October 2025 - The Tuning Fork, Auckland (All ages)\n\nSunday 12th October 2025 - San Fran, Wellington (R18 unless accompanied by your legal guardian)",

Whilst there is some faster efforts needed to come out on top of any of these \u201cdisciplines\u201d, the aim of the game is just to get out there and enjoy yourself at whatever pace suits you.\n\nThe added extra this time is not only an extra hour, explained below, but the plan is to tie this into the elevation for a group effort for a BTR Everest Challenge, more details around this when I can get a team entry together, but really keen to try and pudh the limits of what has been done before.\n\nDetails:\nDate: 26th October - Backup date is the week after\nTime: 6am-1pm - (1 hr per week it too Hialry to conquer everest!)\nLocation: The Wither Hills, Basecamp: Sutherland Stream picnic area - this will be where we have the whiteboard & a bit of an \"Aid station/Bag drop\" situation going on.\n\nDisciplines:\n- \"Vernon Vert Masters\" Highest total elevation (solo/team) - pretty self explanatory, but between the hours of 6 am- 1pm any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day (solo or in a team) counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n\n- \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop (solo/team) - Crush the covenant Loop is a 3.75km, 300m vert loop running from Sutherland Stream Picnic Area to the Mt Vernon Summit & then back down again, the loops can be run in whichever direction you would like, just be aware that this is a 2-way track and there will be a bit more traffic than you would usually see up on it.

Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor. This is despite his daughter being one of the pupils benefiting most from the free expression encouraged by Antonio\u2019s Freinet method teachings. Meanwhile, Ariadna teeters between hope and despair in her search for closure \u2013 a human vessel embodying the plight of a nation still wrestling with the consequences of a brutal conflict.\n\nThe closing credits remark that the remains of 12,000 people have been exhumed across the country. Like Ariadna, the film attempts to seek answers from the horrors of a war that took place almost a century ago \u2013 one driven by political sentiments that feel unsettlingly familiar as some of today\u2019s most powerful nations shift towards fascism. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\n",

Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience.

Instead of being talked at with boring slides, you\u2019ll step into three carefully designed games that let you actually practice leadership.\nYou\u2019ll be experimenting, problem-solving, laughing (a lot), and walking away with insights that stick because you\u2019ve lived them, not just heard them.\nThis isn\u2019t theory. It\u2019s leadership in action.\nLearn more at our website.\nHow it works\nThe day is made up of three 2-hour games. You can book individual sessions ($99 each), or join us for the full day ($297) to play all three and unlock The Leadership Playbook - a bonus 60-minute facilitated debrief where we connect the dots and help you take away a clear set of personal leadership shifts.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s on in Wellington:\nThe Moonlit Market (8:30\u201310:30am)\nPitch, trade, and negotiate under pressure. Build agility, creativity, and bold decision-making in a playful, high-energy marketplace.\nThe Broken Bridge (11:00am\u20131:00pm)\nA fantasy quest to practice difficult conversations. Explore courage, clarity, and how you show up when the stakes feel high.\nThe Inner Tides (1:45\u20133:45pm)\nUse the Emotional Culture Deck in a role-playing game to strengthen emotional awareness, resilience, and confidence in leading with empathy.\nThe Leadership Playbook (4:00\u20135:00pm)\nAvailable only with a full-day pass. A guided reflection session to connect your learning, extract insights, and leave with a practical playbook you can use back at work.\nWhy you should join\nPractical skills, not theory - you\u2019ll walk away with tools and insights you can use immediately.\nSafe practice, real challenges - rehearse tough moments without real-world consequences.\nEnergy + engagement - no sitting back, you\u2019ll be on your feet, in the mix, learning by doing.\nUnique approach - game-based leadership development you won\u2019t find anywhere else in NZ.\nWhether you\u2019re a leader, facilitator, HR/People professional, or just someone curious about growing your leadership edge - this day is designed for you.\nTickets\nIndividual game session: $99\nFull day pass (all 3 games + Leadership Playbook debrief): $297\n\ud83d\udc49 Ready to roll the dice on your leadership?\n\nSpots are limited - grab your ticket today.",

    "description": "Wendyhouse / DSLB / vegetable.machine.animal, Wendyhouse / DSLB / vegetable.machine.animal\nWendyhouse are Bryce Galloway and Daniel Powell (AKA Mr Pudding and EE monk). The pair met at the Elam School of Fine Arts. Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995. Wendyhouse output has been somewhat sporadic ever since, but with EE monk\u2019s recent return, the pair have returned to performing live.\n\nWendyhouse music was initially played on toy musical instruments, the kind that fit inside a Wendy house. Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\n\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo. Guitar, toy keyboard and vocals are the Wendyhouse instruments of choice.\n\n---\n\n\nDSLB\n\nDSLB is the solo project of Chrissie Butler (the shouty bass playing half of the now sleeping duo, mr sterile Assembly). An offshoot from Chrissie's other band Ditzy Squall, DSLB (Ditzy Squall's Lunch Box) is a showcase for a love of long endings and the hum things make when you hold them close to your ear. Performed live, DSLB is an improvised mash-up of ancient record players, purring keyboards, kitchen utensils and found objects. Soundtracks for short films and hand drawn comics are also residents in the lunch box. Recordings are released by skirted Records.\n\nhttps://skirtedrecords.com/dslb/\n\n---\n\nvegetable.machine.animal\n\nNew solo project courtesy of Mr Sterile, in which living fungal and plantlife inform a modular synthesiser with biofeedback. This signal acts upon the synth changing the pitch, tone, rate and more in the delivery of sound. These \u2018curated\u2019 sounds are then responded to with percussion. VMA explores the intersections between spontaneous playing, electronic music, and science-informed inter-species collaboration.\n\nhttps://mrsterileassembly.bandcamp.com/album/my-daughter-the-spider\n\n\n$17.50 presales available via UTR\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

It is a world that, despite its historical setting, feels unnervingly close to our own.\nWith only ten dynamic performers, this is Henry the Fifth like never before: stripped back, sharp, and driven by the raw intensity of Shakespeare\u2019s text.\nExpect fast-paced storytelling, immersive staging, and a production that puts the audience at the heart of the battle.\nFull show duration: 95 min including a 15 min intermission.\n\u201cThis production epitomises what can be achieved when talent, teamwork, hard work, opportunity and passion combine.\u2019\u201d\nNZ Herald on The Tragedy of Macbeth ",

    "description": "MINUIT : The Reunion Shows | P\u014cNEKE (Wellington), SOLD OUT!!!!\nAfter over a decade away, legendary NZ electronic act Minuit are back \u2013 and bringing their iconic live show to Wellington.\n..................................................................................................\nThis reunion makes us very happy because we thought it might never happen \u2013 \u2018the Kiwi band with the French name\u2019 are back together for a series of shows.\nSinger, Ruth, describes the gigs as: \"a chance to dance, laugh and sing (in my case, often the wrong words), together live one more time.\"\nMinuit (minwee) became a must-see live act through the 2000s. Fronted by the enigmatic Ruth Carr, her coy persona ignites while bandmates Ryan Beehre and Paul Dodge forge rib-rattling beats around her.\nTheir debut album, The 88, released in 2003, achieved gold status in New Zealand, quickly followed up by the 'I Hate Guns' EP.\nOver the following decade, the trio toured their synths and samplers from Helsinki to Hanoi crafting their own refreshing sound \u2013 storming The Crystal Method's club night in LA, the FabricLive birthday bash in London, and headlining the Hanoi Music Festival in Vietnam. Along with festivals and shows up and down Aotearoa.\nHaving been retired since 2014, we\u2019re excited to announce that Minuit are back onstage for a limited number of reunion shows.\nThese reunion performances will pay tribute to classic tunes from all four albums 'The Boy with the Aubergine Hair', 'Except You', 'Fuji', 'Menace', \u2018Aotearoa\u2019, \u2018I Hate Guns\u2019, \u2018A Room Full of Cute\u2019, 'Last Night You Saw This Band', \u201825 Bucks\u2019 \u2013 everything gets a look in, plus a couple of other surprises.\nThe show will be supported by Western Haikus and JOLA BURNS.\nMinuit has a heart. And it beats loud. Real loud.",

    "description": "The Racket Lounge: Session Four, Grab a spot on our couch and enjoy the noise at The Racket Lounge, a chill classical music series featuring up-and-coming P\u014dneke classical and jazz musicians.\n\nLast year the NZSQ Trust launched the Racket Lounge, a concert series for classical and jazz musicians with experience ranging from students to pros to freely express their creativity in a non-traditional concert setting. It was a huge success, with over 250 audience members and 52 artists over our four sessions. Audiences were raving about the musical variety and great talent they found at the Racket Lounge, and as one audience member commented; \u201cWell done\u2026do it again!\u201d So, we listened, and the Racket Lounge is back for round two! Once again hosted at Bedlam & Squalor (above the Rogue & Vagabond), we welcome audiences, composers and performers back for another four concerts full of innovative, fun, and chill music. From classical to pop covers, video game soundtracks to original compositions, there's something for everyone to sink their teeth into at The Racket Lounge!\n\nEven if you've never been to a classical music concert before, this one is for you. With a 'Choose your price' model you can afford to give it a go - and you might even find something you like!\n\nA Flexible Price, So You Can Take A Chance on Something New:\nOur prices range from $5 to $100, just pick the ticket price you feel like paying. At The Racket Lounge, we believe everyone should have access to high-quality but affordable art. If you're a bit strapped for cash right now, but still want a good night out, no worries! Just book yourself a $5 ticket! If you can afford to pay a little more and want to do some good for your community, then pick one of our higher ticket prices and rest assured that your dollars are going towards funding great, accessible art in your city.\n\nAll proceeds from ticket sales will go directly into presenting the next Racket Lounge, including paying musicians and artists, hiring instruments and marketing costs. Plus, by choosing a higher price point, you're ensuring that we're able to continue to offer tickets at a lower price point for those who need it.\n\nPlease note: Bedlam & Squalor is a licenced venue, so under 18s must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.

    "description": "First Reserve, Dropper & Elly Mae, Get ready for another memorable night out as First Reserve & Dropper share the bill with rising star Elly Mae. This will be an evening to feast your ears on a diverse soundscape of angular guitars, melodic goodness, and glorious noise.\n\nHere\u2019s the lo-down:\n\nFirst Reserve is inevitable. Before adopting the moniker in 2023, Ryan Connaghan had been prolifically writing music that communicated their experiences in life, love, and loneliness. These themes are all approached on songs like \u201cLast One\u201d and \u201cMe & My Friends\u201d \u2013 the first offerings from First Reserve\u2019s debut EP set for release in late 2025. On stage, their sound is both intimate and larger-than-life, combining influences from alt-rock, indie-folk, and pop.\n\nDropper combines intuitive songwriting sensibilities with wall-of-sound, guitar.  Blending noise and melody, Dropper is dynamic, song-centred, high-energy indie rock. Often compared to Bob Mould\u2019s work with H\u00fcsker D\u00fc or Lou Barlow's early Sebadoh, they\u2019ve been described by one review as having a \"high energy stage performance punctuated by flawless musicianship and songwriting skills that seems beyond the years...Honestly, it\u2019s hard to overstate how impressed I was with Dropper and am eagerly awaiting my next chance to see them live.\u201d\n\nElly Mae's music encapsulates the bittersweet complexities of growth, relationships, time escaping, and the nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, shoegaze and whatnot.\n\nGrab your general release tickets online for just $15! Or, even better, grab an early bird ticket for only $10 and secure your spot for a night of unforgettable live music. Doors at 8pm, first act on at 8:30pm. ",

(Unfortunately, the blood thinners used to prevent such blood clots can increase the risk of bleeding in the brain, a cause of hemorrhagic stroke).\n-Pregnancy or possible pregnancy\n-Asthma\n-Mental Contraindications\n-Substance dependence & addiction (Deep breathwork journeys are not always appropriate for those who are still addicted to a substance, as it tends to raise suppressed or repressed material for processing. However, if you\u2019re currently in recovery, this can be extremely healing, and help you discover the deeper patterns that gave rise to this addiction.

Gamma brainwaves are associated with states of deep meditation, heightened awareness, and higher brain functions.\n\nBreathwork and other deeply meditative practices activate gamma waves and there is a correlation between gamma waves and DMT release, with one seeming to stimulate the other.\n\nBreathwork experiences and benefits so often parallel those of DMT and other psychedelic plant-medicines, DMT is produced naturally in the brain, and is released during Breathwork.\n\n\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude46 \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4e:\n\n\u2022 Anxiety, depression and stress\n\n\u2022 Increase energy & boost immunity\n\n\u2022 Improves sleep\n\n\u2022 Lowers blood pressure & improves circulation\n\n\u2022 Improves mood & self esteem & helps manage depression\n\n\u2022 Relese toxins\n\n\u2022 Helps manage pain & restrictions in the body\n\n\u2022 Releasing trauma & emotion & manage PTSD\n\n\u2022 Gaining body awareness\n\n\u2022 Connecting to intuition and receiving guidance\n\n\u2022 Past life clearing and understanding\n\n\u2022 Spiritual awakening and expansion\n\n\u2022 Karmic release and ancestral work\n\n\u2022 Increasing creativity and self-expression\n\n\u2022 Life purpose clarity\n\nA breathwork journey is unique to each person and and the results are profound.\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a \ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4f:\n\n\u2022 Doors will open at 11.45am and you will have a few moments to get grounded and set up for your \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b experience.\n\n\u2022 We will open up with an introduction to this \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b technique and prepare to start the Breathwork Medicine Journey.\n\n\u2022 You will then be guided through a 90 minute experience recieving healing & expansion bridging the gap between your human self & higher self.\n\n\u2022 Your only job is to be open minded, relax, and let your breath guide you on this medicine journey be open to receive any healing or guidance that comes up throughout the journey.\n\n\u2022 We will close of with an intergration circle finishing up at 2.30PM leaving light grounded and open and with feelings one oneness connected to the universe.\n\n\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude68:\n\nBreathwork results in certain specific physiological changes in the body and also can result in intense physical and emotional release.\n\nAs a precaution, the following conditions are contraindicated in certain breathwork practices.\n\nIt is crucial that you inform your breathwork practitioner if any of the following conditions are relevant to you:\n\n\u2022 Pregnancy (at any stage)\n\n\u2022 Severe PTSD or trauma\n\n\u2022 Currently using recreational drugs\n\n\u2022 Recent surgery\n\n\u2022 Taking any medication that alters brain chemistry like anti-anxiety,anti-depressant, ADD, OCD medications, etc.\n\n\u2022Detached Retina\n\n\u2022Glaucoma\n\n\u2022Kidney disease\n\n\u2022High Blood Pressure\n\n\u2022Cardiovascular disease, including angina, previous heart attack or stroke\n\u2022Diagnosis of aneurysm in the brain or abdomen\n\n\u2022Uncontrolled thyroid conditions\n\n\u2022Diabetes\n\n\u2022Severe Asthma\u2014 for mild to moderate asthma, we can discuss but you must bring your inhaler to the session.\n\n\u2022 Epilepsy\n\n\u2022 History of Seizures\n\n\u2022 Prior diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or previous psychiatric condition.\n\n\u2022Any other medical, psychiatric or physical conditions which would impair or affect the ability to engage in any activities that involve deep physical and/or emotional release.\n\n\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4c\u2019\ud835\ude68:\n\nWhat can I expect?\n\nThere will be a short guided meditation, explanation of conscious connected breathwork (how to do it, tetany, things that may happen etc), a full 60 min breathwork journey and space afterwards for a few to share about their experience and any questions asked and support given if needed.\n\nI have one or more of the listed contraindications -

Dr Barrie has recently revamped the Glendronach lineup, and we're going to see how she's doing: we'll try the previous 12 and 15 year--old bottlings against her new releases. She's worked her magic at Ben Riach, and we'll see how she's doing at Glendronach (I suspect quite well!). Additionally, we'll try the highland peated Glendronach, a departure from the familiar smokey peat of Islay. We'll expect a sweeter, softer style, bolstered by some sherry maturation.\nPlease join me for this wonderful tasting of Glendronachs:\nTuesday, September 9\n7:30pm Start time (arrive early to get a beer and a seat)\n$60 per person\nSeatoun Clubhouse (16 Dundas Street, Seatoun)\nSee you then,\nMatt\nMatt & the Clubhouse Team\n\n*** Please note you need to be a member or a guest of a member to attend.

Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes and troubleshoot guide\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 6-8pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. If for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though. In extenuating circumstances I may be able to hold your ticket for a future workshop; this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n*Payment to clear in bank account two days after ticket bought, after which time your ticket will be released on to someone else. Please pay immediately upon purchasing ticket.\n**All workshop info you need to know ahead of time is in the confirmation email. Please ensure you read this down to the bottom.\n***I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\n\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight! From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody",

    "description": "Intro to 2D Traditional Animation, This is a beginners course in 2D animation where you'll learn the time-honoured principles of hand-drawn animation and how to apply them to your own animation project. You may work on a project incorporating your own ideas, or if you'd rather, an assigned a project from your tutor.\n\nYour tutor, Ross Payne, is a 30-year veteran of traditional 2D animation, and loves to share his knowledge about it for you to love it as much as he does.\n\nIn each lesson there will be examples and demonstrations of the animation principles with follow up exercises to put your new skills into practice. You'll work on your project both during class and at home, applying the animation principles to your individualised project.\n\nYou can choose to draw your animation on paper then scan/capture into your device, or choose to draw your animation digitally, directly into an animation programme. whichever you choose instructions in class will be provided to give you the skills needed for this step.\n\nYou can use any device, ipad or laptop you already own (except a mobile \u2013 it's really not big enough to do good animation on). The school does not provide any digital equipment. It's important that the app/programme is installed on the student's device before the course begins, and that they have had a play on it to get used to how it works. This is so that the student is at least a little familiar with their chosen software so that it's enough to begin learning animation techniques on day one. Additional information found at our website.\n\nRoss will advise you on a variety of animation apps/programmes available online to use, ranging in price from free to not very much. Note - A computer mouse can be used for 2D animation, but digital pens are much easier to use. Prior to the course commencing, you'll receive details of recommended programmes to use for the course.\n\nSuitable for a range of ages, from teens to adults.\n\nTuesday evenings, 14 October - 2 December, 6:30-8:30 pm",

    "description": "Book Launch - South by South by Charles Ferrall, Join us to celebrate the publication of Charles Ferrall's South by South: New Zealand and the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The book will be launched by Harry Ricketts.\n\n- Thursday 18 September, 6pm\n- Unity Books Wellington\n- Free event \u2013 all welcome!\n\nJoseph Kinsey is not a name many of us know \u2013 or not as well as we know the name Robert Falcon Scott. But from his base in Christchurch, Kinsey \u2013 book and art collector, philanthropist, science enthusiast, businessman \u2013 forged deep connections with the Antarctic expeditions and the explorers themselves through his tireless work as the agent for various expeditions. Two other New Zealanders also formed close friendships: Charles Bowen, a former politician, and Wellington lawyer Leonard Tripp, to whom Shackleton declared: \u2018I love you as David and Jonathan loved.\u2019\n\nSouth by South tells the story of New Zealand\u2019s role in \u2018the Heroic Age\u2019, that wave of exploration beginning at the end of the nineteenth century in which men set out to traverse the continent of Antarctica and, if they survived, to bring home their findings. The members of this New Zealander triumvirate were all believers in the British Empire, but the southern voyages were to an uninhabited land.\n\nSouth by South brings to light many letters, newspaper articles, and pieces of official correspondence, much of which has not been published before, during the five expeditions of 1901\u20131916: the Discovery, Nimrod, Terra Nova, Aurora, and Endurance. In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship.

Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

Upon reaching the gods of Mictl\u00e1n, an offering had to be made to them in order to obtain eternal rest.\n\nWhat to Expect\nClaudio will explain why it is important to celebrate and take the time to honour and remember the members of your family, ancestors and loved ones who have passed away. He will also explain the mysticism and spirituality around the Day of the Dead celebration.\n\nWe\u2019ll also learn how to set up your ofrenda, or altar, and which elements are important for it (as well their meaning).\n\nIt's very common for an ofrenda of the dead to be placed inside Mexican homes, decorated with papel picado, food, traditional sweets, and photos of loved ones. Candles and marigold flowers are also placed as a sign of welcome for our loved ones.\n\nFeel free to bring photos of your beloved ones that have passed away, fruits and flowers for the altar and anything that your beloved ones valued / loved when they were here with us. We will place those on the altar.\n\nThe Evening\u2019s Schedule\nCleansing copal and herbal welcoming.\n\nAn opening ceremony to acknowledge the Tlalmanalli (offering and altar) with the deep sound of the conch shell in the four directions and drums sounds.\n\nHistory of the day of the dead celebration.\n\nExplanation of the altar, and the main elements for an ofrenda.\n\nStorytelling: learn of Mexican legends like Catrinas and Xoloitzcuintle (the Mexican dog that helps the dead to find their way to Mictlan, the Aztec underword).\n\nRemembering and sharing histories about the loved ones that passed away (optional but encouraged)\n\nTraditional Mexican chants for remembering the loved ones\n\nAtole de Chocolate, a traditional prehispanic drink - amazing in flavour, consumed cold or hot\n\nMusic to invoke emotion and imagery of contemplative natural and mystical environments\n\nFinish with a shamanic atmosphere of relaxation and traditional chants.\n\nDetails\nWhen: Saturday 1 November, 7pm -9pm\n\nWhere: AWHI Yoga & Wellbeing - Level 2, 15 Johnston Street, Wellington CBD.\n\nInvestment: $55 (first 5 enrolments - $45!); Children under 16 years old - $35\n\nHaere Mai!\nEveryone is welcome including kids (see special pricing).

After being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition at the age of eleven that left him paralyzed from the waist down, Wes experienced a miraculous recovery for which the doctors themselves had no medical explanation.

This immersive sound journey offers a deeply restorative experience that invites you to settle into stillness, reconnect with the heart, and explore a sense of inner spaciousness through vibration and tone.\nClaudio skilfully layers the sounds of gongs, crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, Native American flutes, and other traditional instruments, enhanced through high-quality audio equipment so the sound can be both heard and felt throughout your body.\nHarmonic sound and vibration offer the nervous system a chance to truly rest.

Born into a family of musicians, he began playing music at a young age and later studied classical guitar. His journey led him to Montreal, where he explored jazz, world music, and spiritual sound traditions.\n\nExtensive travels in Asia and Europe deepened his connection with Indian music and yogic philosophy. He studied Tibetan singing bowls in Kathmandu and Varanasi, and has since worked with a wide range of instruments including the sitar, esraj, bansuri, harmonium, flutes, gongs, and voice.\n\nClaudio\u2019s work blends technical skill, deep presence, and a profound respect for the healing power of sound.\n\nLearn more or listen to Claudio\u2019s music here:\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/claudioescutiasounds\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/claudio_yoga_sound_healing\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/soundhealingyogamusicclaudio\n\n\n",

Maitreya, the World Teacher, and his group The Masters of Wisdom are here - not as religious teachers - to inspire all people to create a civilisation based on sharing, justice and peace; and for humanity to act to do the work to share and save our world.\n\nHumanity at spiritual crossroads\n\nHumanity is at crossroads. One path into the future leads to increasing social and economic division, environmental destruction, war and planetary peril. The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\n\nMaitreya\u2019s priorities\n\nTo help humanity in its task of global transformation, Maitreya has formulated certain priorities. They cover the essential needs of all people, every woman, man and child: an adequate supply of food\u037e housing for all; healthcare and education as basic universal rights. Other top priorities include the restoration of the environment and the establishment of peace.\n\nThe key to achieving these goals requires a major shift of present mind-set and thinking, structures and systems \u2013 and more equitable sharing of the world\u2019s food and resources. To realise humanity is one global family and the planet is a living being. According to Maitreya: \u201cWithout sharing, there can be no justice; without justice, there can be no peace; without peace, there can be no future.\u201d\n\n~ followed by short Transmission Meditation session ~\n\nShare International New Zealand.

After winning all major laurels in Nordic cinema with his impressive fresco Beware of Children (2019), the acclaimed director and author embarkson an Oslo-set trilogy simply called Sex Dreams Love.\n\nThe first instalment opens on one of the most tantalising and unexpected preludes in recent cinema. Two chimney sweeps frankly open up to each other on a coffee break in their office: the first reveals that he dreamt of being intensely looked at by none other than David Bowie, who was inspecting him as if he was a woman; the other confesses that he recently accepted the sexual advances of a male customer who asked him to have sex with him. But both men are \u201cstraight\u201d and married to women. Here, the deft tone of the film and Haugerud\u2019s rules of the game are immediately set.\n\nA fervent admirer of Eric Rohmer\u2019s thickly scripted skirmishes of love and ethics, the Norwegian writer-director infuses irony, depth and compassion in each of his elegantly composed tableaux depicting how the two men cope with the turmoil these experiences bring to their relationships with their partners and family, but most of all with themselves. Featuring some of the brightest and funniest dialogues of 2024, Sex is a real eye-opener. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Unkovski\u2019s loveable debut, the first ever Macedonian film to be awarded at Sundance.\n\nStill reeling from the death of their mother and wife, Ahmet\u2019s family is broken. His father, struggling to come to terms with being sole provider and caretaker for the family, pulls Ahmet from school so he can care for their flock of sheep; meanwhile, his younger brother has become non-verbal since their mother\u2019s death. Music is both medicine and matchmaker for young Ahmet, who escapes his grief and the grim mundanity of life under his oppressive father by blasting beats from the world\u2019s jankiest stereo system to impress local girl Aya, back from Germany to be betrothed to an older man.\n\nIn this modern-day Romeo and Juliet, the Yuruk mountain village of Kodzalia takes the place of Verona, while the Montagues and Capulets make way for an eclectic support cast, with a technophobic imam, a souped-up tractor and a fluorescent pink sheep all taking the stage. If music be the food of love, then DJ Ahmet is a feast of thumping electro and dance-floor anthems that spur on the teenage protagonist as he fumbles through the throes of his first romance.

H\u00e9ctor is not. When she tells them she\u2019s pregnant, her own parents can\u2019t hide their shock \u2013 loving but concerned that their daughter will be unable to tackle the task of motherhood. Will the baby be born deaf? Uncertainty abounds as the due date draws closer, and it\u2019s not just \u00c1ngela\u2019s parents who are beginning to have doubts.\n\nThe foundations for the film\u2019s narrative derive from the personal experiences of first-time actor Miriam Garlo, Libertad\u2019s own sister, as she began to contemplate motherhood as a deaf woman. When surrounded by her other deaf friends, \u00c1ngela is comfortable, alive, vibrant within a community that supports her. Around the local mums in the park, or her husband\u2019s friends, isolation sets in with a painful immediacy that anyone who has ever struggled to understand the language in a foreign country will know all too well. A poignant story bound by the chemistry of its leads, deafness is woven into the film as a lived experience, not a defining label. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

    "description": "Reels for Meals: Prime Minister, September's Reels for Meals movie fundraiser is Prime Minister.\nIn August 2017, in the lead-up to national elections, Jacinda Ardern unexpectedly became New Zealand\u2019s opposition party leader. She had just turned 37. Two frenetic months later, she was Prime Minister. Just before the final vote was in, she discovered she was pregnant. She would become only the second head of state in history to give birth while in office.\nArdern quickly became one of the most recognisable leaders in the world. She drew global attention from people craving a sensitive and compassionate approach to the critical issues of our time. In private, she struggled with being a mother and proving herself to a public skeptical of women\u2019s leadership. A series of crises - the Christchurch massacre, pandemic lockdowns, and disinformation-fueled protests outside Parliament - would test that leadership and the feminine touch she brought to it. She resigned from office in January 2023, shocking her supporters and critics alike.\nGoing behind the scenes of her administration and her private life, Prime Minister follows Jacinda for seven years as she is catapulted to the top of New Zealand politics, becomes a feminist political icon, resigns suddenly from office and continues to champion the fight against isolationism, fear, and the distortion of truth. Intimate home footage shot by her husband and audio interviews that Jacinda did while in office give us unparalleled access. Along with in-depth contemporaneous interviews, these form the emotional backbone of the story, giving viewers an unfiltered window into her years in power.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

    "description": "NZIFF: Dreams (Sex Love), A teenage girl recounts her crush for her teacher through the pages of a memoir. The winner of the Golden Bear 2025 is a lucid and tender chronicle of the unforgettable experience of first love.\n\nOriginally intended as the second chapter in his trilogy and released in Norway as such, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Dreams ended up premiering internationally as the last. But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Set in 1954, the film follows Esmeralda Arboleda, a fiercely intelligent leader who sparks a revolution in a society deeply rooted in patriarchal traditions - a revolution that culminates in a fierce and decisve debate. A women group embarks on a historic struggle to bring the issue of women's right to vote before the National Constituent Assembly. With bold marches, radio appearances, and a brilliant media strategy that puts them on the front page, they achieve their goal, but the real challenge begins during the debate, where they face fierce opposition. Esmeralda Arboleda must endure personal attacks from the assembly members, and just as she is about to speak, she receives a heartbreaking call: her son has suffered a serious accident. She is torn between her duty as a mother and her commitment to the cause, with an unfavorable outcome. Although all seems to be lost, her perseverance leads to a historic victory when women's suffrage is finally approved, marking a turning point in Colombia's history.\n\n",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

    "description": "Electrify Wellington: how to save money on your energy bills feat. Mike Casey, It keeps getting more expensive to heat our homes and water, cook our meals and get around. But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",
