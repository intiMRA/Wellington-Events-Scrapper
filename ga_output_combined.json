    "description": "Voices from the Moana: Amplifying Pacific stories of healing and resilience, Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Paci\ufb01c style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and e\ufb00ective insights. Tai refers to ocean waters, which represent your opportunity to rise through the ebb and \ufb02ow of this learning journey. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from di\ufb00erent communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from Voices from the Moana?\nIn Voices from the Moana, you will explore and share rich narratives of healing and resilience from different Pacific nations and perspectives. The Pacific ocean is a diverse place and we have our own unique stories of healing through traditional practices, beliefs and methods. This Talanoa Tai learning experience invites reflection on your own understanding of different healing modalities from the Pacific and the impact it has on your worldview. It will equip you to advocate for social justice through Pacific voices. You'll gain practical tolls and insights that you can apply directly to your work.\nThis is a 3 hour in-person learning experience.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\n Facilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives.

    "description": "NZIFF: Twinless, A grieving brother finds an unlikely connection at a support group for siblings who have lost a twin, but his burgeoning bromance threatens to turn into something darker in this uncomfortably sharp-witted comedy.\n\nWhen his brother is suddenly killed in a car accident, estranged sibling Roman (Dylan O\u2019Brien) suffers the unique pain of being permanently severed from his twin. Inseparable in childhood, the brothers drifted apart as adults, brother Rocky (also O\u2019Brien) living out and proud in Portland while Roman lived a (decidedly hetero) tradie life in hometown Idaho. It seems he\u2019ll never have the chance to work through his complicated feelings towards his twin until stumbling upon a bereavement group for just such a purpose.\n\nThere he meets Dennis (James Sweeney). Neurotic, sarcastic, gay, he\u2019s the opposite that attracts as the pair bond over trauma and a deep need for attachment. They quickly become each other\u2019s emotional support twin-surrogate, on call for late night grocery trips, afterwork bitch sessions, and road trip singalongs. But odd couple bliss can\u2019t last, as Dennis has more than friendship in mind, Roman grapples with explosive anger issues, and dark secrets inevitably come to light.\n\nSweeny\u2019s sophomore effort as writer, director, and co-star walks an entertaining balance between discomfort and hilarity. With finely calibrated performances from both leads, Twinless is witty, warped, and surprisingly warm hearted. \u2014 Adrian Hatwell",

    "description": "Techno Taster, Techno Taster\nThis year for the first of our annual pre-parties we\u2019ve gone around the country to gather a lineup of creators working at the intersections of techno, delving into influences from bass, breaks, psychedelia, club music and beyond, all underpinned by elements of dance music's most enduring genre.\n\nWe believe each one of these acts is currently pushing the needle forward for underground club culture in Aotearoa, and are thrilled to host them all together at Valhalla to push their vision across the almighty Third Eye Hi-Fi soundsystem.\n\n\nELI H\u00d8FF \u2014 Abyssal Soundworks / PHTM\n\nProducer and DJ, Eli is undoubtedly at the forefront of Aotearoa\u2019s underground dance scene.\nThose who have kept their ears tuned to the innovative underground have no doubt stumbled upon the tribalistic, psychedelic, and focused sounds emanating from the mind of Auckland-based producer Eli H\u00f8ff. With a string of releases on Berlin-based PHTM, T\u0101maki Makaurau-based Gypnotica, and an impressive catalog of self-releases, he consistently showcases his singular and original interpretation of dance music.\n\nInstagram.com/e.li\nelihoff.bandcamp.com\nabyssalsoundworks.bandcamp.com\n\n\nHUNTER \u2014 Hang the Saints / Haven\n\nRaised in Kaik\u014dura, Aotearoa, Hunter's dark and atmospheric sound often contrasts the beautiful environment she grew up in. Her direct approach to techno draws influence from heavy percussion, bold rhythm and industrial soundscapes. After spending two years finding inspiration in clubs overseas, she has returned to \u014ctautahi with a refined style that\u2019s ready to make people dance. As the co-founder of \u201cHang The Saints\u201d and resident of \u201cHaven\u201d, Hunter is all about creating safe, inclusive spaces for people to connect through the music she loves.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sspoonsnake/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hunter-mccrory-334790608\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/bC3qeA6pUxBoMo7P9\n\n\nLUDUS & RIZZO \u2014 Tonic Collective\n\nTonic Collective is the recent endeavour of Ludus and Rizzo, inspired by the people, places and spaces of their experience touring China with BIRDPARTY and Vera Ellen. Both acts are individually known for their versatile and innovative sound, bringing a wide range of influences and inspirations to the dancefloor. In the short time since establishing the collective, they\u2019ve already hosted Kaishandao and Bone Chapel, established a space, and debuted a monthly radio show on Mouthfull that explores sound from across the genre spectrum, both in the club and out.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ludus.etc/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alicerizzoofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tonic.collective/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/l-s-rizzo/416life-support-cl1n1c-chengdu\nhttps://soundcloud.com/racquetclub-info/mix-series-016-ludus\n\n\nSHLI \u2014 Echo Train Records / Warehouse Rave / Holding Hands\n\nShli is the alias of \u014ctautahi-via-P\u014dneke DJ and Producer Tim Ward. Steadily releasing works over recent years through local labels like Echo Train and the Big Fresh Collective, he is carving out a sound of his own.\n\nStitching together infectious rhythms layered over low-end pressure, Shli\u2019s sets draw influence from across the hardcore continuum and beyond.

Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it\u2019s going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa.

Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you're a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show digs deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, family, and the undeniable need to keep moving\u2014no matter how creaky your knees may be.\n\nGet ready to laugh, reflect, and maybe even wince in recognition as GOMIL pedals its way across the country this spring. It\u2019s more than a show\u2014it\u2019s a celebration of growing older (and slightly wider) with humour, heart, and a healthy dose of spandex.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next chapter in this iconic Kiwi comedy saga. GOMIL is coming to a theatre near you - lycra, laughter and all.\n\n--\nFor accessibility seating information and wheelchair space bookings please email or call 04)9740535 during office hours.\n\n",

Nothing is ever so simple.\n\nThis genre-defying work of dance, theatre, live film, clown and absurd philosophising takes the idea of the \u2018trigger warning\u2019 to its absurdist extreme to question how \u2018informed\u2019 consent can really be, and asking \u2018How much do you really want to know?\u2019\n\nCreated and performed by multi-award-winning maverick of the stage Eliza Sanders, Manage Your Expectations helps us to see the limits of the power to communicate and our failures to say what we mean. Through movement, multimedia, and razor-sharp wit, it examines the impossibility of perfect communication, musing on the influence of context, identity and personal history while creating something beautiful from our collective mess.\n\n\u201cClever, witty, evocative, subversive, immersive, despairing, poignant, personal and universal\u201d \u2014 Deirdre Tarrant, Theatreview\n\n\u201cBeautifully vulnerable\u201d \u2013 Chloe Jaques, Theatreview, 2024\n\nFull of vigour, energy, chaos and a hint of confrontation, Manage Your Expectations is a mind (and body) bending show about how we connect in an increasingly complex world. And you decide the ending\u2026\n\nContent warning: this show contains explicit content, mild coarse language, heavy nudity, themes of abortion and rape.\n\nWINNER: Best Performer, Whang\u0101rei Fringe 2024\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance, NZ Fringe 2024\nWINNER: San Diego Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Best in Fringe, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Innovative Work, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Sydney Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Auckland Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Melbourne Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Adelaide Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Original Production, Wellington Theatre Awards 2024\n\nTues 16 \u2013 Sat 20 Sept 2025\nQ&A and Choose Your Price Night: Wed 17 Sept\nRelaxed Performance: Thurs 18 Sept\nCirca Two\nTues \u2013 Fri 7.30pm, Sat 20 Sept 2.00pm & 7.30pm\nShow Duration: 75 minutes no interval\nRecommended Age 16+",

    "description": "Messengers, \u2018Animals first entered the imagination as messengers and promises,\u2019 John Berger.\nMessengers explores the enduring gaze shared between humans and other animals. The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

Three mixed-race artists from across Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui \u2014 Carmel Aroha Salmanzadeh, Jessica Miku and Anthony Zemke \u2014 trace the echoes of matrilineal language and culture, reaching for words that live in their mothers\u2019 voices but not their own. The show speaks to the intricacies of love, loss, grief and gratitude. To inherit a tongue but not its fluency is to stand at the threshold of intimacy \u2014 close enough to hear it, yet unable to fully enter. At its heart are nine paintings that pursue a multifaceted visual language that expresses the artists\u2019 ability (or inability) to connect without language.\nTo love without saying \u201cI love you\u201d \u2013 \u201cka nui taku aroha ki a koe\u201d / \u201d\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0645\u201d / \u201c\u3044\u3064\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u201d\nAnthony Zemke (b. 1998, Aotearoa) is an Iranian-P\u0101keh\u0101 illustrator and painter based in T\u0101maki Makaurau.\nWorking within a conceptual framework guided by the Baha\u2019i teachings, Eastern mysticism, and Continental philosophy, Zemke\u2019s practice sees abstraction as the ideal vehicle for communicating psychosocial and spiritual realities. His works explore the boundaries of language, the dialectic of human oneness and diversity, and the various dimensions of radical compassion.\nCarmel Salmanzadeh (b. 2002, T\u0101maki Makaurau) is of M\u0101ori, Iranian, Samoan and Chinese descent. He uri t\u0113nei n\u014d Ng\u0101ti Hauaa, Waikato, Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti, Ng\u0101ti Ira me Ng\u0101ti Porou. Salmanzadeh traces links\nbetween the pictorial languages and motifs used in the traditional and indigenous practices of her multiethnic\nwhakapapa; exploring how visual narratives transcend cultural boundaries. Manifested in large-scale pieces, their works are influenced by the structure and design of Persian carpets, Samoan siapo and M\u0101ori taniko.\nJessica Miku (b. 2000, Whang\u0101rei) is a Japanese/P\u0101keh\u0101 artist based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Using the Japanese cultural anthropological concept Hare-Ke, which harmonises the fantastical with the mundane, they produce paintings of imagined female figures within ecological fantasy. These portals of otherworldliness are used to explore notions of tenderness\u2014in heart, soul, and flesh.\nPromotional Design by Tamara Irvine\nThis exhibition will be accompanied by a written work by Yue Pibrow ",

They trust each other, the audience, improv, and the moment to find their form. Nothing is decided beforehand.\n\nRich and Rebecca Sohn met as improvisers in Chicago over 30 years ago. As long-time teachers, this duo show began when former students asked them to headline a new evening of improv. Students often expressed surprise at how different their teaching styles were and took to saying \u201cyou\u2019re in the Sohn zone\u201d when seeing the couple work together.\n\nD.E.I.'s - Mo Munn & Ralph Hilaga\n\nWhen two besties land jobs at a prestigious company, they discover they\u2019re not there for their skills \u2014 they\u2019re the token hires. What follows is an improvised journey of chaos, corporate jargon, and an earnest attempt to prove they\u2019re more than just the diversity checkbox.\n\nFrom the chaotic minds of Wellington improv duo Mo and Ralph, D.E.I.\u2019s is a sharp, satirical, improvised workplace comedy about tokenism, identity, and the conundrums of modern day allyship. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what happens when the diversity quota starts talking back \u2014 this is it.\n\nAs the Sohn Zone is improvised, we cannot guarantee the presence or absence of specific content or themes beyond what is in the description above. The show may contain mature themes and language, but not gratuitously. D.E.I.'s contains strong language and adult themes, and discussions of topics like racism, queerness, and tokenism. Some material may touch on lived experiences of marginalisation and may be confronting for some audience members.\n\nBoth shows may contain voluntary audience interaction, such as giving a suggestion for a scene.",

Forged by Black and Latinx trans women and queer communities, it began as a protest against the racism they faced from White counterparts within the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as the transphobia and queerphobia they faced from mainstream society.\nIt is a space held to protect trans women of colour. Therefore, guests and participants of this culture alike must uphold respect and honour for this sacred space and those from which it came from. Homophobia, transphobia, or any discriminatory language and/or beliefs will not be tolerated. Remember to check your privilege at the door.\nLearn more about the culture of Underground Ballroom on Google Arts and Culture.\nBe sure to check out the growing Wellington Ballroom scene and community by following @houseofmarama and @ova_collective on Instagram.

Ephemeral, described as \u201cquite spiritually intense music\u201d by The Guardian, explores the transience of human relationships with one another and the natural world through alternatively floating and driving improvisatory impulses of Wilson and his ensemble.\n\nThe quintet for this performance will present the music of Free, Free and Ephemeral in a brand-new configuration: Wilson on saxophone and bass clarinet, Mana Waiariki on violin, Seth Boy on bass, Callum Allardice on guitar, and Abe Baillie on drums.\n\nDave Wilson is a saxophonist, clarinettist, composer, producer, and interdisciplinary scholar. His music bridges avant-garde and experimental music with various groove-oriented styles from the worlds of jazz, R&B, electronic music, and more. Before relocating to Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington in 2016, Dave grew up in the Chicago area, lived for a decade in Los Angeles, and spent several stints living in Skopje, North Macedonia.\n\nPart of the Wellington Jazz Festival 2025",

The goal of these sessions is to spark and support the creation of AI tools and practices that best serve the aspirations of our students and wh\u0101nau, and blend well with the skills and insights of New Zealand's educators.\nPart 1:\nGenerative AI is already in Aotearoa\u2019s primary classrooms.  It is used by many teachers for planning and by \u0101konga both in and out of school.  However, policy, training, and culturally safe practice haven\u2019t always kept pace.\nIn this talk, David Coblentz will provide research-based insights into:\nteacher adoption patterns,\nwhat students say they\u2019re doing (and worrying about), and\nwhere schools are missing guidance.\nWe'll also discuss what AI sovereignty could mean in education in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nThen we can close with some practical steps for boards, leaders, kaiako, and wh\u0101nau to support constructive and equitable AI use in Years 5\u20138.\n*While the formal (and online) event will finish at 5pm, those attending in person are encouraged to stay on for snacks and drinks to share. Stay till 6pm or later, and get into the ideas more deeply, in a room full of good people.\nDavid Coblentz is a Senior Statistician at NZCER. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics, David holds advanced degrees in Biostatistics (MS), History (PhD), and International Studies (MA) from the University of Washington in Seattle. Prior to coming to NZCER and transitioning into an educational research career in 2021, David worked as a biostatistician, data analytics director, and statistical consultant. David also has university teaching experience in history. His areas of interest include data analysis and data science, history education, evaluation, and AI in education.\nPart 2 will follow within two weeks of David Coblentz's presentation. It will be an online event that features two or three local AI in education developers, talking about their current development projects.\nWe intend to record both parts and make them available via our community site - https://community.sovereignai.nz/",

I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect.

Jem's debut graphic novel Folk Remedy Book 1 releases in September 2025, and she's busy working on Book 2. When not making comics you can find Jem dreaming up more story ideas and hanging out with her black cat. You can find her on social media @jemyoshioka most places (Instagram, BlueSky, TikTok, X)\nBuilding Sustainable Art Practices:\nIn 2025 it feels like it's challenging enough to survive as a person, let alone thrive as an artist. But art has the unique power to nourish us in ways nothing else can. In this workshop Jem will share some of the strategies, habits and tools she uses to fit in making graphic novels alongside full time employment without burning out. This session is practice-agnostic, and is designed to facilitate discussion about what a sustainable art practice can look like, how to build one, and how we can support each other when things are tough. No resources required but feel free to bring any notebooks or tools you use to manage your art or your time\n\nAfter that, we\u2019ll share some kai (potluck style), have a relaxed k\u014drero\nThe gathering will be held at a cozy private space in Wellington CBD, easily accessible by public transport.\nMessage us for the exact location: easternsoundcollective@gmail.com\nOr reach out on Instagram/Facebook: @easternsoundcollective\n",

    "description": "Hands-on Sourdough Workshop (Neil's), Sourdough for Beginners - $120 (paid via internet banking)\nCome join us for a hands-on, in-person sourdough workshop at Willow Corner Collective headquarters (aka my home)! This workshop is currently the only hands-on sourdough workshop being offered in the Nelson region - I teach and demonstrate to you and then you get to mix and practice on your own dough as we go along.\nWhether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this event is perfect for anyone looking to master the art of making sourdough bread, learning from someone who has 10+ years of experience. Perhaps you've found all the Youtube tutorials and Instagram how-to's overwhelming and are keen to learn via an in-person class. Then this is for you! I've baked hundreds of loaves in the last year alone, sold at a market, and hosted a pop-up shop. However, my passion really lies with teaching others to bake their own sourdough in their own homes, for their own families (or small businesses - one day!).You will be taught, demonstrated to, and then you get to have a go yourself; whilst learning my tips and tricks along the way. Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes and troubleshoot guide\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 6-8pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. If for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though. In extenuating circumstances I may be able to hold your ticket for a future workshop; this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n*Payment to clear in bank account two days after ticket bought, after which time your ticket will be released on to someone else. Please pay immediately upon purchasing ticket.\n**All workshop info you need to know ahead of time is in the confirmation email. Please ensure you read this down to the bottom.\n***I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight! From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody",

Please bring along a journal or laptop.\n\nCOURSE CONTENT\nEach session presents a key idea backed by research or concrete examples, followed by practical writing exercises with optional sharing.

Figuring out what matters to you, then learning how to grow your fragmented ideas into something whole. For example, how do you turn a feeling, or a fleeting moment in time into a story? Into a painting? Into a work of art? What are the building blocks you need?\n3. Inspiration from other creative sources: people, music, poetry, reading, random incidents. Ways to generate fresh ideas. How to clarify and focus in writing and art.\n4. Structure and boundaries. Dreaming big but being real. How do you find and stick to a creative process?

Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years. She directed One Night Band which won 'Most Original Production' at the Wellington Theatre Awards 2023, and performs regularly as both a player and musician for POPROX.\nISAAC THOMAS has been an improviser and improv musician for a decade in P\u014dneke and Whakat\u016b/Nelson. He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2025. We'll giveaway any spots remaining a few days before the first workshop of the course, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email poproximprov@gmail.com and we'll pop you on the SBL. Everyone on the list will be notified whether there was a place available for them 3 days before the first workshop. ",

Hot drinks will be available, or you can pop out if you need a barista made flat white!\nIf you\u2019re not staying for the full day, we\u2019ll say farewell after lunch and the rest of us will prepare to greet those coming in for the afternoon session.\nThe afternoon will start with a Strong Fit session which will contain elements of our Thursday night class.

Following the session, we\u2019ll have a decent stretch and take the time to review what we\u2019ve learned, chat amongst ourselves, and say farewell before our day concludes at 4pm. ",

    "description": "Financial Planning for Retirement, Financially successful people don\u2019t achieve their wealth by accident \u2013 they make and execute clear plans. Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".\n\n1 Day\nPresented by Paul and Mary-Ellen Gadd.",

The Griegol is a dark fantasy in the vein of Spirited Away, for older children and adults. Drawing from the techniques of silent film, it utilises silhouettes, smoke, puppetry, live music, and live animation. With the operation kept in sight, audiences see both the stage effects and how they are made. Combining hi-fi with lo-fi technology, and the mythic with the everyday, The Griegol is a show without words about death, love, and monsters. After winning Director, Composer, and Production of the Year at the 2022 Wellington Theatre Awards, and touring to the USA, The Griegol returns to the Hannah Playhouse this October.\n\nRecommended for ages 7+\nContains references to death and grief",

    "description": "You Spot It You Got It: Unpacking cultural conditioning and turning the mirror inwards, Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Pacific style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and effective insights. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from different communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from You Spot It, You Got It?\nIn You Spot It, You Got It, you will deepen self-awareness by being encouraged to recognise some of your own conditioning and impacts of this in your daily life/practices. When we are not conscious of the things that might not sit right within us then we unknowingly or knowingly project them onto others. What we reject, we project. By examining patterns and recognising our conditioning, then we can truly understand how we can live in more conscious ways. This Talanoa Tai learning experience offers space for talanoa, tools and exercises to facilitate introspection and personal growth by turning the mirror inwards.\nThis is a 3.5 hour in-person learning experience. The day will start with a mihi whakatau to welcome you into the space.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\nFacilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives.

    "description": "Electrify Wellington: how to save money on your energy bills feat. Mike Casey, It keeps getting more expensive to heat our homes and water, cook our meals and get around. But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

Drawing on the insights of Carl Jung, we\u2019ll uncover how the unconscious mind, shadow, and how unresolved inner conflicts fuel over-thinking. You\u2019ll also learn how the body and nervous system become conditioned to repeat these mental patterns, creating the familiar cycle of racing thoughts and restless emotions.\n\nThrough a guided exercise, you\u2019ll experience practical tools from FasterEFT and the science of neuroplasticity\u2014methods that help rewire the brain and bring the mind back to calm clarity.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, you\u2019ll not only understand the deeper roots of over-thinking, but you\u2019ll also walk away with simple, repeatable techniques to interrupt mental loops, ease the nervous system, and create a lasting sense of inner peace.\n\n\u201cThis is an interactive workshop where you\u2019ll connect with others and see that many of us face the same challenges beneath the surface\u2014making growth and healing easier when we explore them together :)\n\n\u201cThis is an interactive workshop that offers the chance to connect with others on a similar journey.

Gaining international attention after opening for one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most coveted DJs Fred again.. and remixing his song \u2018places to be\u2019, which now has over 2.6M listens on Spotify alone, MESSIE is quickly becoming one of the most exciting new names to watch in New Zealand.\n\nAudiences will be able to enjoy MESSIE\u2019s high-energy, electrifying All Night Long sets in Auckland and Wellington until the early hours of the morning. Saturday, 13 September, will see her take over Auckland\u2019s Studio the Venue, before heading to Wellington\u2019s San Fran the following Saturday, for a sold-out show on 20 September. She\u2019ll return for a second San Fran show on Friday, 26 September, before continuing the TEETH TOUR at Gisborne\u2019s Smash Palace on Friday, 7 November, and Christchurch\u2019s Hide Club on Saturday, 8 November.\n\nMESSIE is taking Aotearoa\u2019s electronic dance music scene to filthy new levels. As a former drummer, her passion for drumming was the pipeline for her falling in love with genres like Garage, Breakbeat, and Jungle. She has since expanded her sound and it\u2019s safe to say each set will keep you guessing what will come next as she effortlessly merges genres such as Baile Funk, Ghetto Tech, Jersey Club, Juke, Afro beat inspired drums, Techno and many more global club soundscapes that encompass her high energy DJ sets. MESSIE\u2019s sets are guaranteed to be bootleg heavy with something for everyone as she draws from her own music taste of rap and grime, to early 2000\u2019s singalongs, girl-boss anthems and queer music culture in the form of edits you\u2019d never expect.\n\nAlongside her headline tour around Aotearoa in mid 2024, MESSIE has now brought her fresh, high-energy club music internationally to Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, R&V, Beyond The Valley, Wildlands, Love Saves The Day, Gemfest & Outro Festival. With slots at Pohoda Festival, Hidden Festival, Motion, Truck Festival, AIASOUND and All Points East already this year, there is no slowing her down.",

Devonshire Teas and home baking served in the Rathkeale Homestead rose garden is a time-honoured tradition while refreshing cold drinks can be sipped on as visitors listen to live music performed by students at various times throughout the day. The popular Christmas cake stall features again this year - but visitors are encouraged to get in early as the cakes often sell out by midday.\n\nThe beauty of this F\u00eate is that it\u2019s a day out for the whole family. In addition to the 120 plus stalls, there is plenty to entertain the children including facepainting and magic shows throughout the day.\n\nVisitors can also explore the beautiful, expansive grounds of Rathkeale College including the school gardens designed by Alfred Buxton, the Greek Amphitheatre and the 3km eco-trail which weaves through large stands of native trees, including ancient kahikatea.\n\nEftpos is available, but we strongly recommend that visitors bring cash.\n\nKoha/gold coin entry.\nRathkeale College is a five-minute drive north of Masterton in the Wairarapa.",

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa. This annual public lecture series recognises the legacy of the late Dr Michael Volkerling who was one of the principal architects of New Zealand's cultural and creative sectors.",

Dame Anne Salmond writes of \u2018competing cosmologies\u2019 and \u2018ontological collisions\u2019 \u2014 European missionaries arriving in Aotearoa in the early 19th century brought a Biblical cosmology that began such a collision.

    "description": "the Jesus Lizard, After initially calling it a day in 1999, the Jesus Lizard officially return full time to save us from the current state of musical mediocrity with their latest album, Rack. A blistering resurgence of the so-called \u2018noise rock\u2019 they helped define alongside contemporaries Big Black, Flipper, The Birthday Party, with their previous and most noted albums Head, Goat and Liar. For those of us who live in fear of the reunion album and subsequent tour, the Jesus Lizard thankfully display not only the same chaotic and dark nihilism of their earlier careers but also the maturity and seasoning of a band riding a wave of renewed and reinvigorated form.\n\nOnce slated by famed engineer Steve Albini as \u201cthe greatest band I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019 the Jesus Lizard not only lived up to this lofty praise in their prime but continue to do so in their advancing years. David Yow still leads the charge as the maniacally possessed frontman entering crowds with reckless abandon and a stamina that much younger vocalists would kill for. The original rhythm section of David Wm Sims and Mac McNeilly further continue to prove why they were and are the best bass & drum combo since Jones and Bonham, anchoring the ship as Captain Yow and first mate Denison navigate the wild seas of their songs. And while he may not always feature (as he rightly should) on many modern music journalists \u2018best guitarists lists\u2019, Duane Denison could perhaps be the most innovative and idiosyncratic punk rock guitarist EVER. However, each member is a sum of their parts but combined they are as Albini also once said \u201cthe purest melding of the sublime and profane.\u201d\n\nWhether you are a longtime disciple of the Jesus Lizard, seeing them when last here in \u201898, or perhaps your fandom is more recent and have only seen videos of their legendary live performances, you will know that these shows are not to be missed.\n\nSaturday 11th October 2025 - The Tuning Fork, Auckland (All ages)\n\nSunday 12th October 2025 - San Fran, Wellington (R18 unless accompanied by your legal guardian)",

    "description": "Treasury Guest Lecture with Michael Keen: IN-PERSON attendance, Join us for our special Fiscal Policy for the Future seminar\nNew Zealand faces significant long-term fiscal challenges, including the rising costs associated with an ageing population, increasing demand for public services, and the need to adapt to a changing global economy. These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand. The Trust was established to support leading tax policy thinking in New Zealand. You can read about the Trust\u2019s work here.\nAbout the presenter\nMichael (Mick) Keen is a former Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, where for over twenty years he played a central role in shaping and delivering IMF policies and advice on tax matters.\nHe has advised finance ministries in all parts of the world, including missions to over forty countries, and led the preparation of influential papers for the G20 and the Executive Board of the IMF.\nBefore joining the Fund, Mick was Professor of Economics at the universities of Essex (UK), Queens (Canada) and Kyoto, and is now Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo.\nMick was the keynote speaker at the 2014 conference on the Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand and has provided peer review for Inland Revenue\u2019s previous Long-Term Insights Briefing.\nMick has jointly authored, with Joel Slemrod, Rebellion, Rascals and Revenue \u2013 an entertaining account of how history illuminates the perennial challenges and timeless principles of taxation\u2014and how the past holds clues to solving the tax problems of today.\nAbout this seminar series\nNew ideas, innovative concepts, research evidence and expert advice are all crucial to stimulate and inform the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis and advice. Our current theme for guest lectures - Fiscal Policy for the Future - explores the role of stabilising, sustainable and effective fiscal policy. Speakers provide insights into how fiscal policy can be designed to support government to meet its current and future objectives and obligations while adapting to changing circumstances and delivering value to the New Zealand public.\nFiscal policy has a stabilising role in helping to smooth the business cycle, while sustainability in fiscal policy is foundational for resilience to both shocks and longstanding challenges, such as climate change, technological advancements, and demographic trends. Ensuring effective and value for money expenditure is important so that fiscal policy contributes to the living standards of New Zealanders, both now and in the future.\nPlease note that the views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series are those of the individual presenters. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the New Zealand Treasury or the New Zealand Government.\nFor updates and our latest research visit: www.treasury.govt.nz\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to be the first to hear about our upcoming events in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series, please SUBSCRIBE to stay up to date.",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene and GIB.\nCPD points: 10\nTIMING:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLECTURE DATES:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

No fancy moves or any previous experience required: our caller will explain each dance, and we\u2019ll all walk it through a couple of times before adding the music.\n\nThis is social dancing so bring all your friends! No need to bring a specific partner - there\u2019ll be lots of friendly people to dance with.\n\nDiscounted online tickets are available on Humanitix until midnight on September 26th: $24 / $16 concession\nhttps://events.humanitix.com/beag-ceili-spring-ceili-2025\n\nSome door sales may be available on the day: $30 / $20 concession (cash only)\n\n\u2014\n\nDoors open 7:30pm\n\nAdults and age 10+ welcome. Under 16s accompanied by an adult.\n\nLight refreshments will be available. We recommend bringing a water bottle to grab a quick drink between dances - hydration is key!\nThis is an alcohol-free event.\n\nGetting here: St Michael\u2019s Hall is located at 81 Upland Road in Kelburn Village, just behind the church.\nThere is very limited on-street parking in the village. We recommend public transport: the 4, 18, 21, and 22 buses stop regularly right outside coming up from Te Aro or down from Northland and Karori.\n\nBe safe online: Tickets are only available online from the Humanitix event. Do not buy tickets from other sources such as Facebook comments or resale sites - these are always scams. If you can no longer attend, please contact us via Humanitix, our socials, or email to discuss refunds.\n\nHealth notice: C\u00e9il\u00ed dancing is a great way to meet lots of people. If you are feeling unwell then please stay home and rest this time, we will see you at the next one.\n\n",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene.\nTiming:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLecture dates:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought.

By 1917 the system had grown and 17 was rebuilt into its current form adding a set of trucks converting the tram to 8 wheels. Tram tram saw regular service until the 1940\u2019s where it was eventually use for peak time travel, before being withdrawn in the late 50\u2019s.\nIt was then sold, and taken to Bell road in Raumati on the Kapiti coast where it served as a beach hutt until the 80\u2019s where it was donated to the Wellington tramway museum for display and eventual restoration.\n2014 a conservation and restoration plan was put together, and the tram was shipped out to the Wheelwright Shop in the Wairarapa for a full body overhaul. It was transported back to the museum in 2017 and put on public display until new trucks (wheelsets) could be manufacturedby A&G price in Thames.\nSince 2019 the tram has undergone new wiring, and extensive testing and running in and is now ready to take passengers along our museum.\nTram 17 is a wonderful achievement by all\nThose involved, and we cannot wait to welcome you this Father\u2019s Day to enjoy a ride on this heritage tram, saved from the scrap heap, and then saved again from rotting away.\nPlease note: We intend to run tram 17, however due to the nature and style of the tram, its operation is weather dependent. If we deem that the tram cannot run, we will advise accordingly. ",

(Unfortunately, the blood thinners used to prevent such blood clots can increase the risk of bleeding in the brain, a cause of hemorrhagic stroke).\n-Pregnancy or possible pregnancy\n-Asthma\n-Mental Contraindications\n-Substance dependence & addiction (Deep breathwork journeys are not always appropriate for those who are still addicted to a substance, as it tends to raise suppressed or repressed material for processing.

Supported by solo sets from ambient/glitch sound wizard Jack Woodbury, and explorer-of-distant-noises Alter Natural sculpting a live set with his homemade suite of digital granular synthesis tools.\n\nThe Temple is a trio composed of producer Jack Woodbury, drummer/percussionist Nathan Carter (aka Alter Natural), and saxophonist Peter Liley, based in P\u014dneke. The Temple's broad palette of influences reaches into minimalism, electronica, ambient, funk, doom metal, new age, sound art, and jungle, creating a beguiling, kaleidoscopic sound. Their shows explore vast musical territories, and every performance is a ritual devoted to the present moment.\n\n---\n\nJack Woodbury is a Wellington-based composer and audio engineer. His compositional work focuses on juxtaposing noise and glitch textures against ambient materials. His work has been presented in the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n---\n\nAlter Natural is a New Zealand-based musician, composer/producer of electronic music, and multi-media sonic artist. As a music composer/producer, much of my work takes inspiration from visual art and real-world subject matter, driven by my deep passion to express beauty and philosophical sublimity through sound.\n\n---\n\nPeter Liley is a saxophonist (alto/bass) exploring the far reaches of technique on the instrument, known for unflinching brutalist soundscapes and endless rippling sequences, achieved using circular breathing.\n\n\nhttps://templenz.bandcamp.com/album/vastness-vastness\n\n$20 presales via UTR\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme.\n\n",

    "description": "Film screening: GAGA, Film screening: GAGA\nJoin us for a special screening of the 2022 Taiwanese comedy-drama film GAGA, featuring a Q&A with the award-winning Director, Laha Mebow\n\nAbout this Event\n\nGaga\u300a\u54c8\u52c7\u5bb6\u300b(2022)\nDirected by Laha Mebow 112 mins, Mandarin/Atayal/Taiwanese, English subtitles\nAmong the Atayal indigenous people of Taiwan, gaga is the traditional law and custom, the way of living with the land and organising society, the source of values. When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

Over half of the country has been liberated by opposition armed groups, but the regime hangs on, using air strikes, forced conscription and brutality to control the main cities and areas of economic value. Amongst the opposition is the punk movement that has led protests, organised Food not Bombs groups, food gardens, social centres and other projects, both inside and outside the country, all run on the smell of an oily rag. Your dollar goes further when it\u2019s in the hands of punks.\n\nWe are screening Linda Linda Linda \u2013 a low-key, cheerful but by no means saccharine, 2005 Japanese film that actually gets punk. It has the same plot as every other rock movie, except this one is believable. Four grumpy teenagers are empowered through a willingness to accept outsiders, music and friendship.\n\nBurmese food from 6pm, a short talk about the situation at 7pm followed by the film.",

The winner of the Golden Bear 2025 is a lucid and tender chronicle of the unforgettable experience of first love.\n\nOriginally intended as the second chapter in his trilogy and released in Norway as such, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Dreams ended up premiering internationally as the last. But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

After winning all major laurels in Nordic cinema with his impressive fresco Beware of Children (2019), the acclaimed director and author embarkson an Oslo-set trilogy simply called Sex Dreams Love.\n\nThe first instalment opens on one of the most tantalising and unexpected preludes in recent cinema. Two chimney sweeps frankly open up to each other on a coffee break in their office: the first reveals that he dreamt of being intensely looked at by none other than David Bowie, who was inspecting him as if he was a woman; the other confesses that he recently accepted the sexual advances of a male customer who asked him to have sex with him. But both men are \u201cstraight\u201d and married to women. Here, the deft tone of the film and Haugerud\u2019s rules of the game are immediately set.\n\nA fervent admirer of Eric Rohmer\u2019s thickly scripted skirmishes of love and ethics, the Norwegian writer-director infuses irony, depth and compassion in each of his elegantly composed tableaux depicting how the two men cope with the turmoil these experiences bring to their relationships with their partners and family, but most of all with themselves. Featuring some of the brightest and funniest dialogues of 2024, Sex is a real eye-opener. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

    "description": "NZIFF: Twinless, A grieving brother finds an unlikely connection at a support group for siblings who have lost a twin, but his burgeoning bromance threatens to turn into something darker in this uncomfortably sharp-witted comedy.\n\nWhen his brother is suddenly killed in a car accident, estranged sibling Roman (Dylan O\u2019Brien) suffers the unique pain of being permanently severed from his twin. Inseparable in childhood, the brothers drifted apart as adults, brother Rocky (also O\u2019Brien) living out and proud in Portland while Roman lived a (decidedly hetero) tradie life in hometown Idaho. It seems he\u2019ll never have the chance to work through his complicated feelings towards his twin until stumbling upon a bereavement group for just such a purpose.\n\nThere he meets Dennis (James Sweeney). Neurotic, sarcastic, gay, he\u2019s the opposite that attracts as the pair bond over trauma and a deep need for attachment. They quickly become each other\u2019s emotional support twin-surrogate, on call for late night grocery trips, afterwork bitch sessions, and road trip singalongs. But odd couple bliss can\u2019t last, as Dennis has more than friendship in mind, Roman grapples with explosive anger issues, and dark secrets inevitably come to light.\n\nSweeny\u2019s sophomore effort as writer, director, and co-star walks an entertaining balance between discomfort and hilarity. With finely calibrated performances from both leads, Twinless is witty, warped, and surprisingly warm hearted. \u2014 Adrian Hatwell",

Despite barely being able to feed themselves due to crippling food shortages caused by international sanctions, the family is randomly selected to prepare a cake as part of the forced national spectacle observing Saddam Hussein\u2019s birthday.\n\nFrom bucolic wetlands to bustling city streets, Lamia embarks on an ingredient-hunting odyssey that mixes equal parts sweet absurdity and bitter reality. Bartering with hawkers, dodging authorities, and begging the kindness of strangers, the young girl encounters the full gamut of humanity, from good to grotesque, as she approaches her ludicrous mission with innocent determination.\n\nDirector Hasan Hadi deftly evokes humour and open heartedness against a bleak background of oppression and war. Cinematographer Tudor Vladimir Panduru summons rich texture from the gorgeous locations, beautifully backed by a flowing soundtrack of traditional strings. \u2014 Adrian Hatwell",

Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor. This is despite his daughter being one of the pupils benefiting most from the free expression encouraged by Antonio\u2019s Freinet method teachings. Meanwhile, Ariadna teeters between hope and despair in her search for closure \u2013 a human vessel embodying the plight of a nation still wrestling with the consequences of a brutal conflict.\n\nThe closing credits remark that the remains of 12,000 people have been exhumed across the country. Like Ariadna, the film attempts to seek answers from the horrors of a war that took place almost a century ago \u2013 one driven by political sentiments that feel unsettlingly familiar as some of today\u2019s most powerful nations shift towards fascism. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.\nAs Glinda\u2019s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba\u2019s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives.\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it's going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa. Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you're a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show digs deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, family, and the undeniable need to keep moving\u2014no matter how creaky your knees may be.\n\nGet ready to laugh, reflect, and maybe even wince in recognition as GOMIL pedals its way across the country this spring. It\u2019s more than a show\u2014it\u2019s a celebration of growing older (and slightly wider) with humour, heart, and a healthy dose of spandex.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next chapter in this iconic Kiwi comedy saga.

The group is now actively\nworking towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\nRomi Wrights\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring\nstories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke\nfestival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release\nmid to late 2025.\n\n",

    "description": "Teaching Well - A supportive school for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), Growing attention to staff wellbeing has resulted in many workplace mental wellbeing initiatives. Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 20% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions. Post workshop consulting services such as mentoring the development of or reviewing a staff wellbeing plan can also be provided.\nPost Workshop Consult:\nSchools and Kuras have the option of a 90 minute consult with Barry in 2026 to review their staff wellbeing plan.\nAN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNING WITH INTERNATIONALLY RESPECTED AND AWARD WINNING MENTAL WELLBEING PRACTITIONER AND SUICIDOLOGIST, BARRY TAYLOR\nBarry has worked in mental wellbeing promotion and suicide prevention/postvention for 37 years at the local, national and international levels.

Dr Barrie has recently revamped the Glendronach lineup, and we're going to see how she's doing: we'll try the previous 12 and 15 year--old bottlings against her new releases.

Additionally, we'll try the highland peated Glendronach, a departure from the familiar smokey peat of Islay. We'll expect a sweeter, softer style, bolstered by some sherry maturation.\nPlease join me for this wonderful tasting of Glendronachs:\nTuesday, September 9\n7:30pm Start time (arrive early to get a beer and a seat)\n$60 per person\nSeatoun Clubhouse (16 Dundas Street, Seatoun)\nSee you then,\nMatt\nMatt & the Clubhouse Team\n\n*** Please note you need to be a member or a guest of a member to attend.

Swapping textbooks for tongs, she left her degree behind to dive headfirst into the kitchen. Now a chef de partie at Loretta, Jessie brings a grounded, fresh perspective to one of the city\u2019s most beloved eateries.\r\n\r\n11 August \u2014 Felipe Molina, El Matador\r\nHailing from Chile, Felipe Molina is a professional chef with over 15 years of experience in kitchens around the world.

From there, he headed to Queenstown, learning from a wide range of chefs and kitchen styles before challenging himself with a move to Wellington. Since then, he\u2019s worked at some of the city\u2019s top restaurants and now brings his thoughtful, evolving style to Graze Wine Bar.\r\n\r\n25 August \u2014 Lulu Temmuyin, Mr Go\u2019s\r\nLulu Temmuyin is a chef who loves pushing boundaries, even when they\u2019re unexpected.

MESSIE\u2019s sets are guaranteed to be bootleg heavy with something for everyone as she draws from her own music taste of rap and grime, to early 2000\u2019s singalongs, girl-boss anthems and queer music culture in the form of edits you\u2019d never expect.\n\nAlongside her headline tour around Aotearoa in mid 2024, MESSIE has now brought her fresh, high-energy club music to Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, R&V, Beyond The Valley, Wildlands, Love Saves The Day, Gemfest & Outro Festival.

    "description": "Katie Knowles PAM, Title:\nSelf-Disclosure of Sexual Dysfunction to Romantic Partners.\n\nAbstract:\nSexual dysfunctions (e.g., distress about levels of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain) are linked with poorer individual and relational wellbeing. Disclosing these dysfunctions to a romantic partner helps to mitigate these effects, however, such disclosures also risk rejection or relationship conflict. Existing models of disclosure do not adequately capture the complexities of disclosing sexual dysfunction, such as how costs and benefits are weighed simultaneously, the role of contextual factors, or how partner responses shape future disclosures. Three studies test a model of people\u2019s disclosure of sexual dysfunction. Study 1 reports a thematic analysis of people\u2019s social scripts about disclosing sexual dysfunction. Subsequent studies will test the influence of positive and negative partner responses and develop a scale to measure the anticipated costs and benefits of disclosing dysfunctions. Altogether, these studies build a framework explaining how and when people will disclose sexual dysfunction to romantic partners.\nPrimary supervisor: Dr Matt Hammond\nSecond supervisor: Dr Ally Gibson\nStaff and postgraduate students are cordially invited to attend. There will be an opportunity at the end of the presentation for audience to observe the panel questioning the candidate about the presentation and proposed research, and for audience members themselves to ask questions of the candidate.\n",

In this public lecture Bradford Haami will explore the interactions between Biblical and M\u0101ori cultural and spiritual worldviews that continue to evolve up to the present.\n\n* How do Biblical and M\u0101ori cultural and spiritual beliefs and thought relate?\n* How 19th century rangatira negotiate between traditional beliefs and the Biblical narratives?\n* Where do Christian and M\u0101ori ways of knowing and seeing clash, compete or enrich each other?\n* What does being M\u0101ori and Christian look like today?\n\n\nBradford Haami (Ng\u0101ti Awa) is a M\u0101ori historian, researcher and author with research interests in M\u0101ori worldviews, spirituality, Christianity and cultural preservation. He is Pou Amorangi (M\u0101ori Director) at Laidlaw College in Auckland, New Zealand, where he lectures in biculturalism and sits on the governing board of the college. Haami has written several books on M\u0101ori history, culture and spirituality, with recent works including Urban M\u0101ori: The Second Great Migration (Oratia Media 2018) and Bringing Culture into Care (Huia 2019). He was the M\u0101ori curator/expert on the acclaimed Te Taiao / Nature exhibition at Te Papa Tongarewa Museum.\n\n--\nTo browse the Ramsey Library catalogue, and sign up to borrow books (free), go to https://library.chaplaincyvuw.org.nz\n\n",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

The establishment of a nuclear free zone has served as inspiration\nworldwide, yet, despite this, the nuclear issue remains relevant to New Zealand. As long as\nnuclear weapons exist, their environmental, humanitarian and geopolitical impacts extend far\nbeyond the borders of nuclear weapon states.\nThis panel and fireside chat seeks to situate New Zealand\u2019s position within the global\nnuclear landscape, exploring why the issue continues to matter to a nuclear free country,\nhighlighting the interconnected impacts of these weapons, whilst also considering New\nZealand\u2019s role as a disarmament leader.",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced.

Dr Storey assesses the legacy of the Soviet Union, charts the evolution of Putin\u2019s foreign policy and identifies the drivers behind the Kremlin\u2019s \u2018Turn to the East\u2019 or Asia pivot. His book also examines Russia\u2019s dialogue partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the development of Moscow\u2019s political, economic and military ties with each of the 11 regional states over the past 25 years. A large part of the book is devoted to Southeast Asia\u2019s responses to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At the end of the talk Dr Storey will also provide an update of Russia-Southeast Asia relations in 2025 and how the region views the on-going Russia-Ukraine War.\nDr Ian Storey is a Senior Fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Singapore.

The album drops 19 September on streaming & vinyl.\n\nNever overblown or overproduced, Dreams That Feel Like Falling is direct and intimate. 11 tracks of warmth, sincerity and brashness that strike a balance of breeze and overdrive.\n\nTo celebrate the release, Cowboy Dan are heading out for a run of shows throughout Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui in September and October.\n\nThis Te Whanganui-a-Tara will be the second outing in the capital for Cowboy Dan, who are delighted to bring Echo Children along for the ride from T\u0101maki to share their special tunes and infectous harmoines, along with Te Whanganui-a-Tara local legends Search For Yeti...STACKED!\n\nOnce aptly described as The Bats on the right amount of Red Bull, Cowboy Dan has been treating audiences across the motu to energetic, emotionally charged tunes since 2015. Their live shows have consistently delivered good times to fans and new friends alike.\n\nOff the back of two delightful EPs: We Will Hesitate, When We Eventually Wait (2017, Mixed by Jonathan Pearce); Sentimental Now That We're Leaving (2021, Mixed by Rohan Evans), the debut LP, Dreams That Feel Like Falling, is a continuation and a few steps forward, showcasing the bands expansive sonic pallet, with a mix of distortion, introspection, heart and bite.\n\nSearch For Yeti draws from a deep range of influences to create a sound that achieves the difficult feat of being hugely atmospheric and diverse while also being hook laden. This is an act that captures people with their onstage energy \u2014 and gets them talking afterwards about the songs that they just heard.\n\nFollowing in the long tradition of innovative Aotearoa indie bands, Echo Children craft a distinctive sound by melding psychedelic pop harmonies with sharp alt-country songwriting.\n\nGather your pals and get ready for good times! A thursday, sure, but what a chance to digest some upbeat goodness hailing from the big smoke and with some local goodness to boot.\n\n",

But what if they could actually paint the scene?\n\nThanks to the generous support of Resene Paints, we'll be doing just that: actually painting our scenes onto the stage and walls at BATS. Come send off the Festival with a messy, beautiful explosion of colour!\n\nAs this show is improvised, we cannot guarantee the presence or absence of specific content or themes beyond what is in the description above. The show may contain mature themes and language, but not gratuitously. The show may contain voluntary audience interaction, such as giving a suggestion for a scene.\n\n",

The inclusion of considerable footage from Jacinda's partner Clarke Gayford provides a deeply personal view of life as the Prime Minister in very challenging times.\n(Los Angeles Times review) 'Prime Minister' is not interested in wrangling, dealing and lawmaking, or even the nuts and bolts or her progressive views. ..

    "description": "Katie Knowles PAM, Title:\nSelf-Disclosure of Sexual Dysfunction to Romantic Partners.\n\nAbstract:\nSexual dysfunctions (e.g., distress about levels of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain) are linked with poorer individual and relational wellbeing. Disclosing these dysfunctions to a romantic partner helps to mitigate these effects, however, such disclosures also risk rejection or relationship conflict. Existing models of disclosure do not adequately capture the complexities of disclosing sexual dysfunction, such as how costs and benefits are weighed simultaneously, the role of contextual factors, or how partner responses shape future disclosures. Three studies test a model of people\u2019s disclosure of sexual dysfunction. Study 1 reports a thematic analysis of people\u2019s social scripts about disclosing sexual dysfunction. Subsequent studies will test the influence of positive and negative partner responses and develop a scale to measure the anticipated costs and benefits of disclosing dysfunctions. Altogether, these studies build a framework explaining how and when people will disclose sexual dysfunction to romantic partners.\nPrimary supervisor: Dr Matt Hammond\nSecond supervisor: Dr Ally Gibson\nStaff and postgraduate students are cordially invited to attend. There will be an opportunity at the end of the presentation for audience to observe the panel questioning the candidate about the presentation and proposed research, and for audience members themselves to ask questions of the candidate.\n",

    "description": "Electrify Wellington: how to save money on your energy bills feat. Mike Casey, It keeps getting more expensive to heat our homes and water, cook our meals and get around. But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

Set in the Belmont Regional Park, the three courses take you through a mix of lush native bush, open ridgelines, and rolling farmland with epic views across the Wellington harbour, Hutt Valley, and out to the coast. The short course is a compact loop with punchy climbs and flowing descents, while the long course gives you the full Boulder Hill experience \u2014 a steady climb from the valley floor to the summit, followed by sweeping downhills and one final sting in the tail before you loop back to base. A true taste of the terrain that makes this region so special.\n\nhttps://barefootxtrail.co.nz/\n\n",

There\u2019s no pressure to join, but sitting down to eat together is a simple, powerful way to deepen the sense of connection. Andre & Sri Jiva aren\u2019t running this circle for profit and they are genuinely invested in creating real, meaningful spaces for men to connect.\nThe Men\u2019s Circle is a gathering where men are able to connect in a safe, supportive space to share experiences, express emotions, and foster personal growth. Free from societal expectations of stoicism or self-sufficiency. Through open sharing and mutual support, participants are empowered to build resilience, self-reflection, and a stronger sense of identity and purpose.\nStructure of the Circle\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.A short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center. Only the personholding the object may speak, ensuring uninterrupted sharing.\nOpen Sharing: Anyone may choose to share while holding the object. Sharing is op-tional, and passing is always respected.\nActive Listening: While one person shares, others listen attentively without speaking,interrupting, or offering advice. The focus is on witnessing and being present.\nNo Judgments or Advice: Participants refrain from judging or offering unsolicitedadvice, creating a safe space for authentic expression.\nClosing: The circle may conclude with a group reflection, a moment of gratitude, or a simple acknowledgment of the shared experience.\nCircle Agreements\nSupportive Environment: We are here to uplift and support one another, fosteringtrust and brotherhood.\nFocus on the Present: Share whats alive for you now, focusing on your emotions and experiences to deepen emotional awareness.\nUse \"I\" Statements: Speak from your personal perspective using \"I\" statements topromote authenticity and responsibility.

That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 05:45 PM\nArrive to Bhakti Lounge\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:45 PM - 07:15 PM\nMen's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\nHost: Andre\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:15 PM - 08:15 PM\nPlant-based dinner and dessert!\n\n\n",

Whether you are single or partnered, whether your past experiences were harmonious or painful, each relationship reflects the inner dance of the masculine and feminine within us.\n\nThroughout history, these sacred energies\u2014Yin and Yang\u2014were meant to complement and support each other. Yet, distortions, suppression, and separation have created wounds that echo through generations. Many of us carry beliefs such as:\n\nMen cannot be trusted.\nWomen are not safe.\nLove must be earned.\n......\n\nRarely do we pause to sit with these wounds and meet the unhealed parts of our inner feminine and masculine.

From suicidal depression to shamanic path, my spirituality is not based on how many trainings, meditations, and ceremonies I have done, it\u2019s coming from a deep embodied experience to transform pain into wisdom and empowerment. The shamanic path is a way of being; we allow ourselves to go deeper within to connect all things that come from oneness. I loved my work, which has been proven to help people really change their lives. If you are curious about what this mini workshop could bring, having an open mind and open heart, you will be surprised by how much can be done just in this brief journey within.\n\n\n\nWith love,\nFery Qiu\n\n",

When triggered, these unconscious \u201cprograms\u201d hijack our reactions, leaving us feeling stuck even when we want to move forward. In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore how trauma influences the nervous system and why awareness alone isn\u2019t enough to create lasting change.\nIn this 75 minute workshop, you\u2019ll discover how trauma impacts the nervous system and learn FasterEFT tools to release triggers, reframe old memories, and reset your stress response. You\u2019ll walk away with simple, science-backed practices you can use every day to build resilience and emotional freedom.\n\u201cThis is an interactive workshop where you\u2019ll connect with others. It\u2019s a powerful reminder that, beneath the surface, we generally share the same challenges and struggles\u2014and that healing becomes easier when we explore them together.\u201d\nMeet your host, Krishnaloka\nIntroducing Krishnaloka, who is driven to help others overcome their issues within their mind and pyschology. As a mind technician trained in eutaptics (Faster EFT), she employs the fastest and most powerful method to create lasting change by addressing the root causes of issues rather than just the symptoms. Her warm and caring nature makes every interaction with her both comforting and transformative.\n\n\n6.15pm Tuesday 7th of October\nEnd the session on a high note with a delicious plant-based dinner, dessert, and good conversation.\nTickets available here~ bit.ly/eventTickets\nBhakti Lounge 1/175 Vivian Street, Te Aro, Wellington. http://www.bhaktilounge.org.nz ",

We were also making experimental attempts into the world of radio, with the birth of Mouthfull\u2019s first international streaming server, playing music 24/7 (also live events a few times a week).\nIf we travel even further back in time, 2017 was the debut of the \u201cMouthfull Radio\u201d episodic series (~20eps) - but we consider the ongoingness the real thing to celebrate.\nMoving towards present day ~ through a vast richness of hosts, events, music, shows, zines, selectors, connections, pop ups, and story-times. It is a real joy to help community contemporary radio ripple out from this Pacific Island nation to the world wide web.\n\n5 Years goes so fast, and so we shall honour this time with a great celebration in the capital city of Aotearoa! We will bring together all of the elements of Mouthfull you have known to love; make some books, make up some new dance moves with friends, and make our ears glisten in the sounds of live and selected music.\nWhiro // New Moon. The last dark night of winter. A time for reflection; an invitation to come together as friends and wh\u0101nau and plant intentional seeds for future flowers to bloom, as well as rest in deep listening and shared beingness.\n\nLineup:\n*\u00baJuniper May\n*\u00baStar Time\n*\u00baajhoneysuckle (t\u0101maki)\n*\u00baMystery Waitress (duo)\n*\u00baDJ B.Lo (wh\u0101katu)\n*\u00b0Benny Salvador\n\n\nWe are also releasing our first ever compilation. This special event will be opened with a premiere listening session of the full CD, playing the album all the way through. You can purchase a physical copy at the show, or on bandcamp (preorders open September 1st).\n5PM sharp CD push play. Some divine collaborators with unique new releases on offer.\n\nThis is a fundraiser to support the sustainability of Mouthfull. We are only able to pay the bills due to events like this, and are fundraising to support a long awaited update of our digital infrastructure to enable future support. THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT - you can support us by purchasing a ticket (extra donation if you are balling), a tshirt, a raffle ticket, or a zine - it all goes to the same goal of enabling & uplifting one another.\n",

Nothing is ever so simple.\n\nThis genre-defying work of dance, theatre, live film, clown and absurd philosophising takes the idea of the \u2018trigger warning\u2019 to its absurdist extreme to question how \u2018informed\u2019 consent can really be, and asking \u2018How much do you really want to know?\u2019\n\nCreated and performed by multi-award-winning maverick of the stage Eliza Sanders, Manage Your Expectations helps us to see the limits of the power to communicate and our failures to say what we mean. Through movement, multimedia, and razor-sharp wit, it examines the impossibility of perfect communication, musing on the influence of context, identity and personal history while creating something beautiful from our collective mess.\n\n\u201cClever, witty, evocative, subversive, immersive, despairing, poignant, personal and universal\u201d \u2014 Deirdre Tarrant, Theatreview\n\n\u201cBeautifully vulnerable\u201d \u2013 Chloe Jaques, Theatreview, 2024\n\nFull of vigour, energy, chaos and a hint of confrontation, Manage Your Expectations is a mind (and body) bending show about how we connect in an increasingly complex world. And you decide the ending\u2026\n\nContent warning: this show contains explicit content, mild coarse language, heavy nudity, themes of abortion and rape.\n\nWINNER: Best Performer, Whang\u0101rei Fringe 2024\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance, NZ Fringe 2024\nWINNER: San Diego Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Best in Fringe, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Innovative Work, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Sydney Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Auckland Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Melbourne Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Adelaide Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Original Production, Wellington Theatre Awards 2024\n\nTues 16 \u2013 Sat 20 Sept 2025\nQ&A and Choose Your Price Night: Wed 17 Sept\nRelaxed Performance: Thurs 18 Sept\nCirca Two\nTues \u2013 Fri 7.30pm, Sat 20 Sept 2.00pm & 7.30pm\nShow Duration: 75 minutes no interval\nRecommended Age 16+",

They will learn to cut the glass, and prepare it before foiling and soldering each piece, creating a simple elegant colourful glass project.\n\nThe aim of this one day class is to leave with a completed small leadlight glass item.\nMore experienced students may bring existing projects to work on in class - though emphasis will be placed on focusing on the same techniques of flat, nicely soldered simple designs.\n\nThis is a warm and friendly class with excellent support and learning for complete beginners and more advanced students. All tools are supplied, though you are welcome to bring your own tools and glass if you have them.\n\nYour materials for your beginner project are supplied as part of your course fee.\nAdditional materials and tools are available to purchase.\n\nNot suitable for children. Older teenagers (16+) are welcome.",

    "description": "Inner Marlborough Sounds Kayak Trip, Inner Marlborough Sounds Kayak Trip\n\n\nHi this is a trip through the Inner Marlborough Sounds, suitable for beginners who have gone to at least one SKISL and be OK with rescues. The focus is on camping, coffee, and having a fun time with relatively short kayaking times on the water.\n\nThe schedule for Wellingtonians is: on the Thursday 29th Ferry over to Picton, in at 12:30, launch from Picton beach head over to Kumoto, tents up, Friday - paddle around the Bay of Many Coves, stop for coffee / lunch / chips / shower at Punga Cove, stay at Camp Bay. Maybe a quick trip over to Bumine Island with empty boats. Saturday night at Ratimira for camping / snoozing. Sunday - up early, on water at 8am, paddle back to Picton in by 12, lunch, on 1pm sailing. So 4 days with Blumine as an optional paddle, mostly shortish trips. We might shift the plan around depending on the weather, but that sets out the general plan.\n\nFor the ferry you need to book your own tickets and I would urge you to get your ferry tickets now as they go fast. If you are concerned about the weather get the fully refundable tickets. When you buy your ticket select the \"kayak\" option. Any questions ask them in the comments below.\n\n",

After the short break, we\u2019ll regroup for a Q&A session and finish with a tote bag-making activity led by Paek\u0101k\u0101riki artist Selina Tuomey.\n\nHe Kura Toi Tangata exhibition ends Sunday 12 October.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Gaayathri\n\nGaayathri Nair is a double diaspora person hailing from the southwest of India via Malaysia and coming to Aotearoa through economic migration in the 1980's under Rogernomics. She grew up in T\u0101maki Makaurau and now lives in Te Awakairangi and works in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. She is a counsellor and facilitator, novice gardener, passionate knitter, frazzled PhD student, and shares a home with a delightfully awkward greyhound named Kevin.\n\n\n\nAbout Krissi\n\nKrissi Smith is of primarily Scottish (Clans McColl, Ross, Hogarth, Sutherland, Buchanan, Mactavish), Irish and English descent, but she grew up in Te Upoko o te Ika on Taranaki Wh\u0101nui land. She currently lives in Te Ngaengae in Te Awakairangi, still on Taranaki Wh\u0101nui land, and close to Waiwhet\u016b. Krissi is a Tiriti educator, an accredited interpreter and translator, and a teacher of te reo M\u0101ori. She co-directs K\u016bwaha Ltd, with two of her besties: T\u0101whana Chadwick and Raih\u0101nia Tipoki. She's also a m\u0101m\u0101 to one kid, one step kid, and Nanna to one moko. She has three dogs and five chickens. She loves growing kai and cooking it for people, singing karaoke, and sewing. She's a lover of learning and is getting pretty damn comfortable with not knowing the answers!\n\n\n\nAbout Selina\n\nSelina Tuomey has an Irish father and an English mother. She came to Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa for the love of this land and a man. As a child in England, her most cherished possession was an Air New Zealand green, plastic tiki sent to her by her pen friend.\n\nShe is a mother to three sixth-generation, beautiful, young P\u0101keh\u0101 people. Selina has a Fine Art BA Hons and is all about art and nature, acting, painting, murals, clay play and drawing. She has a love of colour, growing trees, food and going bush. Selina is a mermaid and loves people. He tangata, he tangata, he tangata.",

Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

This characterful work depicts a short and unsuccessful attempt at seduction. We finish with Schubert's mighty and virtuosic Octet, a work filled with jaunty dances, singable melodies and heart-rending moments.\n\nAroha String Quartet:\nHaihong Liu & Konstanze Artmann - violins\nZhongxian Jin - viola\nRobert Ibell - cello\nAcclaimed as demonstrating \"accomplished brilliance, soulfulness and sublime intensity in perfect balance and tonal unity\" (The Dominion Post), the Aroha String Quartet is firmly established as one of New Zealand's finest chamber music ensembles. Founded in 2004, this versatile Wellington-based quartet is known for its passionate musicality, impressive technique, and multicultural innovation.\n\nNick Walshe - clarinet\nNick Walshe is a clarinettist, music teacher and arts administrator based in Te Whanganui a Tara/Wellington.

    "description": "PANEL TALK: BALLROOM CULTURE, Ballroom is a queer subculture. The Ballroom scene today was created by Black and Latinx trans women in the late 1960s in Harlem, New York. Since then, ballroom has taken over the world with scenes in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania.\nThe Aotearoa Ballroom scene was ignited by M\u0101ori and MVPFAFF+ youth in T\u0101maki Makaurau over 10 years ago, and has since inspired other leaders across the motu to forge their own Ballroom communities in their respective cities. \nIn preparation for The Grand Kiki House of Marama Ball, hear from influential figures who have made significant contributions to their own scenes. With international Icons and Legends coming to Aotearoa for the first time, there has never been a better time to learn and enhance our own knowledge and experience of Ballroom. \nFeaturing ballroom leaders Arturo Mulan (NYC, USA), Matyouz Royalty (Paris, EU), Jaycee Iman (Auckland, NZ), Karamera Marama and Rom\u00e9 Marama.\nPanellists\nIcon Arturo Mulan (NYC Father of the International House of Miyake-Mugler) (he/him) is a ballroom Icon and Legend from the beating heart of Ballroom, NYC. Arturo has been involved in Ballroom since 1996 and has established himself as a visionary choreographer and community leader, with the title of NYC father of the international mainstream House of Miyake Mugler. His influence spans competitive wins, global workshops, and has dedicated his time to bringing diverse artistry into ballroom culture, and ballroom culture into diverse arts opportunities; such as Legendary - Season 2 (HBO Max), Brooklyn Nets performances, Cats the Jellicle Ball on Broadway and more.\nIcon Tantine Matyouz Royalty (International Godmother of the International House of Gorgeous Gucci) (he/she/they) is a ballroom Icon and Legend from the Paris Ballroom scene and is the creator of the \u2018Fashion Killa\u2019 category.

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

Max 5 people.\nCome and have a go at wet-plate collodion photography, using authentic materials to produce your own heirloom image as were made 170 years ago. This almost lost art produces one-of-a-kind images on tin or glass plates, which you create and have an image you\u2019ve crafted to take away.\n\nBrian Scadden will be your instructor for this workshop. Brain has been passionate about photography for over 40 years, beginning his career at the National Film Unit in the 1970s before joining Park Road Post Production as Head of Laboratory, Head of Picture, and Restoration Manager. His work in film sparked an interest in early photographic techniques, prompting him to master wet-plate collodion photography. In 2006, he was invited to assist leading wet-plate experts in the USA and has since taught many New Zealanders this challenging process. Jane, who attended Brian\u2019s workshop in 2014, later married him in 2019 and completed a photographic project in Carterton in 2016.\nAlthough Brian retired in 2015, he returned for short-term assignments at Park Road Post and part-time work at Archive NZ, supporting film archiving until mid-2023. Both Brian and Jane continue to shoot with 35mm and 120mm film using vintage cameras from their collection.\n\nNOTE: Link for booking tickets coming soon.\n\nEmail:\nwww.greytownarttown.com\n\n",

    "description": "Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour, Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour\nIndie-Folk Artist Colette Rivers and her band will be performing her intimate new album, The Backyard Wonder.\n\nIndependent artist Colette Rivers is releasing her second full-length album, The Backyard Wonder, an intimate exploration of healing, change, and the quiet beauty of ordinary moments.\n\nThis album holds special meaning for Rivers: after being diagnosed with cancer in July 2023, her planned sophomore release had to take a back seat to recovery. But when the cancer returned in early 2025, she felt compelled to finish and release the album, not just as a legacy project, also as a celebration after hard times, with a focus on how \u201cyou can find the wonder in life, even in your backyard.\u201d\n\nA lifelong creative, Rivers records, mixes, and produces in her home studio in Masterton, and plays every instrument heard on The Backyard Wonder. Her debut album, Memory Lake (2020), was shaped by early years spent in the US, and her move to Taup\u014d at age 11; this was followed by a nationwide tour. Now based in the Wairarapa and working as a secondary school drama teacher, Rivers continues to move between solo performance and full band sets, while staying rooted in the acoustic traditions that define her sound.\n\nWith her right arm partially paralysed following recent treatment, Rivers has gathered a group of close friends to help bring the songs of The Backyard Wonder to life (especially its intricate fingerpicking parts) for a run of live shows. She\u2019ll be touring the Wellington and Wairarapa regions from August through October, finishing with a set at the Wellington Folk Festival.\n\nFor updates, and behind-the-scenes glimpses, visit www.coletteriversmusic.com or follow @colettemusic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nOpening for Rivers are artists:\n\nPhil Masters\nPhil Lively-Masters is an experienced, well travelled singer songwriter who specialises in writing the sort of Sun Kissed West Coast Laurel Canyon Americana that made Neil Young, Stephen Stills and the Byrds famous. With a powerful, honey soaked voice that has won praise and support slots from legendary American country rock pioneers like The Jayhawks and original cosmic cowboy Steve Young, Phil has 20 years worth of road worn original songs to pull on, including tracks from the critically acclaimed CANYON RYDE album 'Free To Be' and some choice country rock covers to weave a spell on any listener.\n\nSaali Marks\nA singer, songwriter, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, Saali Marks hails originally from the\nSouth Island, but has made Wairarapa his home for the last 20 years, where he lives on a farm\nwith his family and teaches music at Kuranui College.\nSaali has played in numerous bands over the years, in a wide range of styles from proto-punk\nto psychedelic dub, covers, originals and fully improvised music with no discernible genre, on\nstages throughout Aotearoa since 1991. Currently he fronts the Wellington ska band Battleska\nGalactica.\nThroughout and alongside it all Saali has indulged his love for songwriting and solo\nperforming, developing a unique style, rooted in folk and blues, and inspired by greats from\nacross the decades. A skilled guitarist, Saali rarely plays straight ahead chords, and an\neducation in jazz has informed his ear for harmony, the beauty of dissonance, tension and\nresolution, with unconventional song structures, alternate tunings and intriguing melodies.\nAlthough not adverse to penning the odd love song, most of Saali\u2019s lyrics tend to focus on\nother aspects of the human condition, from religion and politics to our relationships with the\nenvironment and our own minds.\n\n",

From local music students to top-notch international artists we\u2019ve seen it all.\nIt\u2019s a huge milestone - 20 years of high quality music played by a massive variety of talented people.\nThe exciting programme is largely finalised and is pasted below.\nMark the date!\nTable bookings 04 974 2207 or info.therealm@nzvenueco.nz or therealm.co.nz and click on \u2018book a table\u2019\nGreat ambience, good company, superb kai and stellar music.

    "description": "Jazz Orchestra Composer Series Presents Louisa Williamson, The ninth concert in this series of Aotearoa composers features the multi-talented saxophonist/composer Louisa Williamson.\n\nSince completing a Masters of Music in Composition in 2020, she has released two albums of original music (What Dreams May Come and Groundwork). In 2023 Louisa won the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award for her piece Dream Within A Dream, and in 2024 Louisa received a composition commission from the Wellington Jazz Festival and headlined the festival with the new work, The Chasm Where We Fall Into Each Other.  Louisa has worked with L.A.B, Bret McKenzie, AJA, The Rodger Fox Big Band, Royal NZ Air Force Band, Trinity Roots and Lord Echo.\n\n\"This commission opportunity has come at a perfect time for me to process some recent grief and pain that\u2019s inhabited my circles. Whilst composing this music, I\u2019ve thought about ideas around mental health, specifically with youth in Aotearoa, and also honouring some friends who have passed. I think artists have the ability to turn heartbreak into beauty, and this music is an attempt at that. Although the inspiration which generated the music is heavy, the performance itself will hopefully feel light and reflective (turning heartbreak into beauty = darkness into light!), and will embrace and celebrate the talents of the musicians who are playing. I\u2019ve brought together a beautiful group of people who I know will handle this music with care and fortitude\"\n\nBryn van Vliet - alto/flute\nTyaan Singh - alto sax\nLouisa Williamson - tenor/flute\nEilish Wilson - baritone sax\nSylvester Green - trumpet\nKaia Johnstone - trumpet\nKaito Walley - trombone\nJakob Elijas - trombone\nAnna Lee - euphonium\nSam Zhu - tuba\nLeonardo Coghini - piano\nJacob Hurst - bass\nMax Sheehan - drums\n\nThe Jazz Orchestra Composer Series showcases original music for large jazz ensemble by New Zealand composers.

The pair met at the Elam School of Fine Arts. Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995. Wendyhouse output has been somewhat sporadic ever since, but with EE monk\u2019s recent return, the pair have returned to performing live.\n\nWendyhouse music was initially played on toy musical instruments, the kind that fit inside a Wendy house. Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\n\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo. Guitar, toy keyboard and vocals are the Wendyhouse instruments of choice.\n\n---\n\n\nDSLB\n\nDSLB is the solo project of Chrissie Butler (the shouty bass playing half of the now sleeping duo, mr sterile Assembly). An offshoot from Chrissie's other band Ditzy Squall, DSLB (Ditzy Squall's Lunch Box) is a showcase for a love of long endings and the hum things make when you hold them close to your ear. Performed live, DSLB is an improvised mash-up of ancient record players, purring keyboards, kitchen utensils and found objects. Soundtracks for short films and hand drawn comics are also residents in the lunch box. Recordings are released by skirted Records.\n\nhttps://skirtedrecords.com/dslb/\n\n---\n\nvegetable.machine.animal\n\nNew solo project courtesy of Mr Sterile, in which living fungal and plantlife inform a modular synthesiser with biofeedback.

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa. This annual public lecture series recognises the legacy of the late Dr Michael Volkerling who was one of the principal architects of New Zealand's cultural and creative sectors.",

    "description": "The Greatest Story - A Group of Wise Teachers Returning, Public Talk & Workshop\n\nThroughout history, especially at times of crisis, great spiritual teachers have emerged to show humanity the next step forward.\n\nAccording to British artist, author and esotericist Benjamin Creme, a group of such spiritual teachers is now living in the modern world. Maitreya, the World Teacher, and his group The Masters of Wisdom are here - not as religious teachers - to inspire all people to create a civilisation based on sharing, justice and peace; and for humanity to act to do the work to share and save our world.\n\nHumanity at spiritual crossroads\n\nHumanity is at crossroads. One path into the future leads to increasing social and economic division, environmental destruction, war and planetary peril. The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\n\nMaitreya\u2019s priorities\n\nTo help humanity in its task of global transformation, Maitreya has formulated certain priorities. They cover the essential needs of all people, every woman, man and child: an adequate supply of food\u037e housing for all; healthcare and education as basic universal rights. Other top priorities include the restoration of the environment and the establishment of peace.\n\nThe key to achieving these goals requires a major shift of present mind-set and thinking, structures and systems \u2013 and more equitable sharing of the world\u2019s food and resources. To realise humanity is one global family and the planet is a living being. According to Maitreya: \u201cWithout sharing, there can be no justice; without justice, there can be no peace; without peace, there can be no future.\u201d\n\n~ followed by short Transmission Meditation session ~\n\nShare International New Zealand.

The Magnificat is a world favourite, arguably Bach's best choral piece that has transcended the ages, celebrating Luke's description of Mary's pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, the choir and orchestra perform Ritchie's Then I Understood. When a child of seven to nine, Laura Rangers sketched eight poems centred on summers at Otaki Beach, Ritchie seized the opportunity to add the musical dimension and the result are dual choirs - the Renaissance Singers split - accompanied by the Sinfonia to set off Rangers' delightful insights, so elegantly displayed. The magic that can be childhood.\n\nThe concert has a celebratory theme, it being the 50th anniversary of the choir. Thus the inclusion of Forrest's Three Nocturnes that express the wonderment involved when examining the heavens and the universe full of stars. Throughout this piece the percussionists alone from the Sinfonia provide whimsical accompaniment with a celeste providing the heavenly tones - a hit when played on the last occasion the choir sang the piece.\n\nOpening the concert will be Carl Orff's O Fortuna from his popular Carmina Burana. While O Fortuna laments the role of fate it is set in the larger piece that celebrates life with gusto.\n\nWith the performers in great form (two choristers just back from singing with the world's best choir) this concert will no doubt build the sense of celebration - full of life and wonderment.\n\nGeneral Admission $25, Concession $20, Secondary School $15,\nUnder 13 Free.\n\n",

This work offers a moment of balance \u2014 a conversation between violin and viola, full of warmth and understanding, reminding us of beauty even in troubled times.\nWith generous support from the Orchestra Wellington Foundation we also reveal a brand-new secret: the world premiere of \"House of the Faun\" by WIlliam Philipson, the 2025 SOUNZ Commission for Orchestra and Sistema Youth Orchestra | Te Tono Mahinga a SOUNZ m\u0101 te R\u0101ngi Puoro me te R\u0101ngi Puoro Taiohi a Sistema.

    "description": "Electrify Wellington: how to save money on your energy bills feat. Mike Casey, It keeps getting more expensive to heat our homes and water, cook our meals and get around. But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

Ephemeral, described as \u201cquite spiritually intense music\u201d by The Guardian, explores the transience of human relationships with one another and the natural world through alternatively floating and driving improvisatory impulses of Wilson and his ensemble.\n\nThe quintet for this performance will present the music of Free, Free and Ephemeral in a brand-new configuration: Wilson on saxophone and bass clarinet, Mana Waiariki on violin, Seth Boy on bass, Callum Allardice on guitar, and Abe Baillie on drums.\n\nDave Wilson is a saxophonist, clarinettist, composer, producer, and interdisciplinary scholar. His music bridges avant-garde and experimental music with various groove-oriented styles from the worlds of jazz, R&B, electronic music, and more. Before relocating to Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington in 2016, Dave grew up in the Chicago area, lived for a decade in Los Angeles, and spent several stints living in Skopje, North Macedonia.\n\nPart of the Wellington Jazz Festival 2025",

Since we will be viewing and discussing potentially sensitive topics, the event will have an Open Door Policy, which means that you may leave the venue any time, for any reason, and will not be judged for doing so.\nWHAT IS MARTIAL LAW?\n\"Martial law refers to the replacement of civil rule by military rule. This may be characterized by curfews, the dispensation of military tribunal rulings on civilians, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, which in Latin refers to \u201chaving the body\u201d, is a citizen\u2019s protection against unlawful imprisonment. This is suspended in times of crisis to expedite justice\" (Martial Law Museum).\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY?\nHuman rights violations and extrajudicial killings are still on-going in the Philippines under President Bongbong Marcos, the son of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. who proclaimed Martial Law in 1972, and Vice President Sara Duterte, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte who spearheaded the violent War on Drugs in 2016 (Karapatan).\nWHY WOULD I WANT TO JOIN THE FILM SCREENING?\nThe film screening is for anyone who is keen to learn about the Martial Law Era, wants to share their experience during the Martial Law (or something similar) through group discussion, wants to meet new people, wants to watch a Philippine film/documentary, or just wants to have snacks.\nI WANT TO JOIN BUT I'M FROM T\u0100MAKI MAKAURAU / CHRISTCHURCH / THE PHILIPPINES.\nWe will stream the film through Zoom for viewers outside Te Whanganui-a-Tara, however, there may be internet and other technical difficulties during the event itself. Also please make sure to select the \"Online\" ticket option when RSVPing.\nHOW MUCH IS THE TICKET?\nThe film screening is free but we appreciate koha for the venue/snacks/donations to Philippine non-governmental organisations (NGOs).\nNOTE: This is an LGBTQ+ friendly event.",

    "description": "Wendyhouse / DSLB / vegetable.machine.animal, Wendyhouse / DSLB / vegetable.machine.animal\nWendyhouse are Bryce Galloway and Daniel Powell (AKA Mr Pudding and EE monk). The pair met at the Elam School of Fine Arts. Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995. Wendyhouse output has been somewhat sporadic ever since, but with EE monk\u2019s recent return, the pair have returned to performing live.\n\nWendyhouse music was initially played on toy musical instruments, the kind that fit inside a Wendy house. Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\n\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo. Guitar, toy keyboard and vocals are the Wendyhouse instruments of choice.\n\n---\n\n\nDSLB\n\nDSLB is the solo project of Chrissie Butler (the shouty bass playing half of the now sleeping duo, mr sterile Assembly). An offshoot from Chrissie's other band Ditzy Squall, DSLB (Ditzy Squall's Lunch Box) is a showcase for a love of long endings and the hum things make when you hold them close to your ear. Performed live, DSLB is an improvised mash-up of ancient record players, purring keyboards, kitchen utensils and found objects. Soundtracks for short films and hand drawn comics are also residents in the lunch box. Recordings are released by skirted Records.\n\nhttps://skirtedrecords.com/dslb/\n\n---\n\nvegetable.machine.animal\n\nNew solo project courtesy of Mr Sterile, in which living fungal and plantlife inform a modular synthesiser with biofeedback. This signal acts upon the synth changing the pitch, tone, rate and more in the delivery of sound. These \u2018curated\u2019 sounds are then responded to with percussion. VMA explores the intersections between spontaneous playing, electronic music, and science-informed inter-species collaboration.\n\nhttps://mrsterileassembly.bandcamp.com/album/my-daughter-the-spider\n\n\n$17.50 presales available via UTR\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

This immersive sound journey offers a deeply restorative experience that invites you to settle into stillness, reconnect with the heart, and explore a sense of inner spaciousness through vibration and tone.\nClaudio skilfully layers the sounds of gongs, crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, Native American flutes, and other traditional instruments, enhanced through high-quality audio equipment so the sound can be both heard and felt throughout your body.\nHarmonic sound and vibration offer the nervous system a chance to truly rest. In this state of relaxation, the thinking mind softens, and we find connection to citta \u2014 the heart-mind. From this place, silence arises naturally through the vehicle of sound.\nThis experience is open to everyone. No previous yoga or meditation practice is needed.\n\nWhat to bring:\nYou are welcome to bring your own yoga mat, though studio mats are also available. We will provide bolsters, blankets, and eye pillows for your comfort.\n\nBooking is essential \u2014 spaces are limited and this event often fills quickly.\n\nAbout Claudio\nClaudio is a multi-instrumentalist musician originally from Mexico City and now based in Wellington. Born into a family of musicians, he began playing music at a young age and later studied classical guitar. His journey led him to Montreal, where he explored jazz, world music, and spiritual sound traditions.\n\nExtensive travels in Asia and Europe deepened his connection with Indian music and yogic philosophy. He studied Tibetan singing bowls in Kathmandu and Varanasi, and has since worked with a wide range of instruments including the sitar, esraj, bansuri, harmonium, flutes, gongs, and voice.\n\nClaudio\u2019s work blends technical skill, deep presence, and a profound respect for the healing power of sound.\n\nLearn more or listen to Claudio\u2019s music here:\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/claudioescutiasounds\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/claudio_yoga_sound_healing\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/soundhealingyogamusicclaudio\n\n\n",

Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor. This is despite his daughter being one of the pupils benefiting most from the free expression encouraged by Antonio\u2019s Freinet method teachings. Meanwhile, Ariadna teeters between hope and despair in her search for closure \u2013 a human vessel embodying the plight of a nation still wrestling with the consequences of a brutal conflict.\n\nThe closing credits remark that the remains of 12,000 people have been exhumed across the country. Like Ariadna, the film attempts to seek answers from the horrors of a war that took place almost a century ago \u2013 one driven by political sentiments that feel unsettlingly familiar as some of today\u2019s most powerful nations shift towards fascism. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

Unique sounds encourage reflection, connection, and inner calm, while gentle karakia and mindful intention weave the journey together, creating a meditative space to pause and breathe.\n\nAfter the sound bath, enjoy a nourishing plant-based dinner and dessert included in your ticket \u2014 a wholesome way to close the evening in good company.\n\nMeet your hosts & musicians, Smita & Peter, Smita (Ng\u0101i Te Rangi) was born and raised in Aotearoa. From a young age she was drawn to music as a means for reflection and self-expression. During her music studies at university, she was introduced to taonga p\u016boro, and this sparked a personal journey of reconnection to te ao M\u0101ori and her own whakapapa. Following university, she lived in an ashram for several years where she was introduced to the wonderful practice of bhakti yoga. She now lives with her husband in the Wellington region, where they regularly participate in kirtan (mantra music meditation) at Bhakti Lounge.\n\nPeter is P\u0101keh\u0101, with grandparents from England and Ireland, and has been on a four-year journey learning the art of taonga p\u016boro \u2014 the traditional M\u0101ori musical instruments of Aotearoa. Guided by the wisdom and generosity of expert makers and players, he has learned both to craft and to play these unique instruments. For Peter, taonga p\u016boro offer a way to connect deeply with sound, story, and the natural world, and he is excited to share their voices as part of this sound bath experience.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the menu?\nJackfruit Rendang\n\nSatay Seitan Skewer\n\nGado Gado salad with peanut sauce\n\nRice\n\nBanana cake with caramel sauce\n\nHot \"chocolate\"",

The tent is lovely during the day, but as it gets dark, it takes on a magical feeling. Fairy lights and crystals lit by gently changing coloured lights. We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle. Arniya then dances the energy in with Celestial Energy Movement, for the group. This creates a vortex of Divine power into the middle of the tent. Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\n",

    "description": "Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2, Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2\nThe Second coming of the \"Crush the Vernon\" Vert Day is just around the corner, We had such a great time last time and its smack bang into the point where everyone needs elevation for events so i thought it would be silly not to bring it back!\n\n\"Crush the Vernon\" is a couple of fun endurance challeges to get us up into the Wither Hills for a big vert day!\nThis event will push you to the red line, boasting both as much high-level uphill suffering as you can possibly endure whilst building a steady accumulation of regret over 6 hours on the trails.\nIt\u2019s an event that's built to stretch the boundaries of what you think you can do uphill, but overall, it\u2019s a chance to get out there and have some fun, whether solo or in a team. Whilst there is some faster efforts needed to come out on top of any of these \u201cdisciplines\u201d, the aim of the game is just to get out there and enjoy yourself at whatever pace suits you.\n\nThe added extra this time is not only an extra hour, explained below, but the plan is to tie this into the elevation for a group effort for a BTR Everest Challenge, more details around this when I can get a team entry together, but really keen to try and pudh the limits of what has been done before.\n\nDetails:\nDate: 26th October - Backup date is the week after\nTime: 6am-1pm - (1 hr per week it too Hialry to conquer everest!)\nLocation: The Wither Hills, Basecamp: Sutherland Stream picnic area - this will be where we have the whiteboard & a bit of an \"Aid station/Bag drop\" situation going on.\n\nDisciplines:\n- \"Vernon Vert Masters\" Highest total elevation (solo/team) - pretty self explanatory, but between the hours of 6 am- 1pm any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day (solo or in a team) counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n\n- \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop (solo/team) - Crush the covenant Loop is a 3.75km, 300m vert loop running from Sutherland Stream Picnic Area to the Mt Vernon Summit & then back down again, the loops can be run in whichever direction you would like, just be aware that this is a 2-way track and there will be a bit more traffic than you would usually see up on it. The aim of the game here is to get as many laps in as possible between 6 am-1pm; this will also count toward your elevation total for the \"Vernon Vert Masters\"\n\nThe Basics:\n- This is an open event to anyone who wants to participate\n- The event is open from 6am-1pm - any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n- We will have a basecamp/aid station at the Sutherland stream picnic spot. This will be the hub for the meet-up and the start/finish line for the laps of \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d.\n- No minimum time, you can start whenever you like in the 6 am-1pm timeframe and go for as long as you would like.\n-You can do as many laps/summits/cumulative elevation as you like/can within the timeframe.\n- Teams - Teams can be between 2-5 people for the overall elevation challenge, and your total elevation will be your total accumulated. You will need to pre-register your team with Mikey before the day so that we can have you on the scoreboard.\n- You will need to confirm your solo/teams total elevation with Basecamp by 1.30pm on the day, in person. If you are unable to do this for whatever reason, you will need to confirm and prove details via message or screenshots so we can add them to the total tally.\n\n\nWho's up for some hills?\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nWe at Blenheim Trail Runners don\u2019t see ourselves as event organisers and as such, do not have any consent or insurance; we deem this as a \u201cClub Meet-up\u201d.\nWith that, the expectation is that you are 100% responsible for yourself and take part at your own risk.\nBe aware, as this isn't a formal event, there won't be any official timekeeping, marshals or trail markers. There will be DIY DIY-type whiteboard to note down your shared laps & elevation, and we will provide details via trail maps for the \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop.\nWe are unable to provide any/can not be held responsible for: Urgent medical attention (we will however, assist wherever possible, there will be a first aid kit at base camp), nutrition, hydration ( there is public access throughout the hills and in two points on the \u201ccrush the Covenant\u201d loop), the condition of the trail on the day or the weather.\n\n",

After being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition at the age of eleven that left him paralyzed from the waist down, Wes experienced a miraculous recovery for which the doctors themselves had no medical explanation.

He spent his high school years in Northern Ontario and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and three children.\n\nWesley is currently the Central Canada Director for Apologetics Canada and has been a guest on a variety of public platforms, from The Joe Rogan Experience and Piers Morgan Uncensored, to Apologia Radio and Daily Dose of Wisdom. He has participated in numerous public dialogues, debates, and interfaith events on issues of belief and religion globally.\n\nHe holds a BA in sociology from York University, a Masters of Theological Studies from Tyndale University, and is currently doing a PhD in New Testament at the University of Toronto\u2019s Wycliffe College.\n\n",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene and GIB.\nCPD points: 10\nTIMING:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLECTURE DATES:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

    "description": "Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2, Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2\nThe Second coming of the \"Crush the Vernon\" Vert Day is just around the corner, We had such a great time last time and its smack bang into the point where everyone needs elevation for events so i thought it would be silly not to bring it back!\n\n\"Crush the Vernon\" is a couple of fun endurance challeges to get us up into the Wither Hills for a big vert day!\nThis event will push you to the red line, boasting both as much high-level uphill suffering as you can possibly endure whilst building a steady accumulation of regret over 6 hours on the trails.\nIt\u2019s an event that's built to stretch the boundaries of what you think you can do uphill, but overall, it\u2019s a chance to get out there and have some fun, whether solo or in a team. Whilst there is some faster efforts needed to come out on top of any of these \u201cdisciplines\u201d, the aim of the game is just to get out there and enjoy yourself at whatever pace suits you.\n\nThe added extra this time is not only an extra hour, explained below, but the plan is to tie this into the elevation for a group effort for a BTR Everest Challenge, more details around this when I can get a team entry together, but really keen to try and pudh the limits of what has been done before.\n\nDetails:\nDate: 26th October - Backup date is the week after\nTime: 6am-1pm - (1 hr per week it too Hialry to conquer everest!)\nLocation: The Wither Hills, Basecamp: Sutherland Stream picnic area - this will be where we have the whiteboard & a bit of an \"Aid station/Bag drop\" situation going on.\n\nDisciplines:\n- \"Vernon Vert Masters\" Highest total elevation (solo/team) - pretty self explanatory, but between the hours of 6 am- 1pm any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day (solo or in a team) counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n\n- \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop (solo/team) - Crush the covenant Loop is a 3.75km, 300m vert loop running from Sutherland Stream Picnic Area to the Mt Vernon Summit & then back down again, the loops can be run in whichever direction you would like, just be aware that this is a 2-way track and there will be a bit more traffic than you would usually see up on it. The aim of the game here is to get as many laps in as possible between 6 am-1pm; this will also count toward your elevation total for the \"Vernon Vert Masters\"\n\nThe Basics:\n- This is an open event to anyone who wants to participate\n- The event is open from 6am-1pm - any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n- We will have a basecamp/aid station at the Sutherland stream picnic spot. This will be the hub for the meet-up and the start/finish line for the laps of \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d.\n- No minimum time, you can start whenever you like in the 6 am-1pm timeframe and go for as long as you would like.\n-You can do as many laps/summits/cumulative elevation as you like/can within the timeframe.\n- Teams - Teams can be between 2-5 people for the overall elevation challenge, and your total elevation will be your total accumulated. You will need to pre-register your team with Mikey before the day so that we can have you on the scoreboard.\n- You will need to confirm your solo/teams total elevation with Basecamp by 1.30pm on the day, in person. If you are unable to do this for whatever reason, you will need to confirm and prove details via message or screenshots so we can add them to the total tally.\n\n\nWho's up for some hills?\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nWe at Blenheim Trail Runners don\u2019t see ourselves as event organisers and as such, do not have any consent or insurance; we deem this as a \u201cClub Meet-up\u201d.\nWith that, the expectation is that you are 100% responsible for yourself and take part at your own risk.\nBe aware, as this isn't a formal event, there won't be any official timekeeping, marshals or trail markers. There will be DIY DIY-type whiteboard to note down your shared laps & elevation, and we will provide details via trail maps for the \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop.\nWe are unable to provide any/can not be held responsible for: Urgent medical attention (we will however, assist wherever possible, there will be a first aid kit at base camp), nutrition, hydration ( there is public access throughout the hills and in two points on the \u201ccrush the Covenant\u201d loop), the condition of the trail on the day or the weather.\n\n",

    "description": "Porirua Parkrun, What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

The book will be launched by Always Becominging.\nWednesday 3 September, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nAll welcome!\nWhat would he have wanted? As little fuss as possible. But, reading between the lines: a little help. All the latest gossip and complaints. An arse that is not wrong. Opulence. One leap from the rope ladder. The final word.\nIt\u2019s What He Would\u2019ve Wanted is the sixth book of poetry from the author of the acclaimed The Stupefying. In this hilarious and affecting new work, Nick Ascroft writes of lost friends, new frailties, new braveries, and being stuck in an organ pipe during a recital and not wanting to bother anyone about it. Yes, there are poems of cycling into dead-end utility holes but also poems of trembling resolve and arriving at work as aged as the night sky after completing the morning school drop-off. This is the best collection yet by one of the most exciting and mercurial poets writing in Aotearoa today.\nAbout the author:\nNick Ascroft is the author of five previous poetry collections with Te Herenga Waka University Press, most recently The Stupefying (2022) and Moral Sloth (2019). Living in Thorndon, he is a public servant and the president of Scrabble Wellington.\nCover design by Todd Atticus. ",

    "description": "Teaching Well - A supportive school for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), Growing attention to staff wellbeing has resulted in many workplace mental wellbeing initiatives. Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 20% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions.

Dame Anne Salmond writes of \u2018competing cosmologies\u2019 and \u2018ontological collisions\u2019 \u2014 European missionaries arriving in Aotearoa in the early 19th century brought a Biblical cosmology that began such a collision. In this public lecture Bradford Haami will explore the interactions between Biblical and M\u0101ori cultural and spiritual worldviews that continue to evolve up to the present.\n\n* How do Biblical and M\u0101ori cultural and spiritual beliefs and thought relate?\n* How 19th century rangatira negotiate between traditional beliefs and the Biblical narratives?\n* Where do Christian and M\u0101ori ways of knowing and seeing clash, compete or enrich each other?\n* What does being M\u0101ori and Christian look like today?\n\n\nBradford Haami (Ng\u0101ti Awa) is a M\u0101ori historian, researcher and author with research interests in M\u0101ori worldviews, spirituality, Christianity and cultural preservation. He is Pou Amorangi (M\u0101ori Director) at Laidlaw College in Auckland, New Zealand, where he lectures in biculturalism and sits on the governing board of the college. Haami has written several books on M\u0101ori history, culture and spirituality, with recent works including Urban M\u0101ori: The Second Great Migration (Oratia Media 2018) and Bringing Culture into Care (Huia 2019). He was the M\u0101ori curator/expert on the acclaimed Te Taiao / Nature exhibition at Te Papa Tongarewa Museum.\n\n--\nTo browse the Ramsey Library catalogue, and sign up to borrow books (free), go to https://library.chaplaincyvuw.org.nz\n\n",

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa.

This hands-on interaction brings a sense of movement and authenticity that\u2019s hard to achieve otherwise.\n\nThe sculpting process typically starts by analyzing the model\u2019s proportions and pose. A wire armature is built to support the structure and clay is gradually applied to develop the form to a one-third life size 750mm tall figure. From there the artist refines the shapes focusing on anatomical accuracy and expressive detail that give the sculpture its final character.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in traditional sculpture and the film industry Javier is not just a sculptor \u2014 he\u2019s a mentor.

She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight! From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody",

    "description": "Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days, Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days\nThis workshop is ideal for advanced students who have already learned how to set cabochon stones. Over two three-hour sessions, 20 and 27 September, 10am-1pm, you will be given an understanding of the technique of setting faceted stones using a setting burr, hammers, punches and burnishing tools. This is the first step in learning to flush set facet cut stones so they sit below the surface of the metal.\n\nSession 1 will cover the technique, demonstrations and the basics of preparing and cutting the setting. Students will be shown how to set their stones, and may begin to do this in class, but will then go on to repeat and practice the technique in their own time.\nThey can do this at home, or for a small extra cost, can stay on at the studio to practice setting for the afternoon.\n\nSession 2 will pick up on the setting techniques, reminding and refining essential steps in the process. Troubleshooting can be covered in this class, as well as learning to clean up the settings. The principles of this setting technique will be covered in a few different scenarios, as some students may wish to take this skill into different styles or directions.\n\nThe option for students to have a half-day bench hire after class will also apply to this session.\n\nWhat is provided: class fees cover your practice metal (copper) and stones (CZ) and detailed handouts that are useful for you to take away to refer to when practising and honing your skills.\n\nCorrectly sized drills and setting burrs will be provided in class, but students must purchase their own burrs for practice after class and any future bench hires. These are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nWhat to bring: Advanced students can bring projects to set stones into, but please note the metal must be at least 2mm thick and we do not allow brass to be used as a project or practice for beginners. The metal must be copper or sterling silver.\n\nStudents should bring either a craft magnifier or magnifying lenses/glasses. If you have your own flex shaft tool you plan to use at home for drilling and setting, please also bring this along so that your tutor can advise on the best way to use it. We have two drilling machines in the studio, and these must be shared between the students, so if you have a machine, do bring it.\n\nPractice bench hire after class $20 per person (till 4pm) must be booked in advance.\n\nWorkshop fee $195, Early bird $175 till 24 August.\n\n",

This is truly going to be the most gentle Airhorn you have seen.\nThere will be no flashing lights or threat of epilepsy. There will not be loud noises or gross out humour. There will not be airhorns! This is not a bit. We are sincerely concerned that folks are going to come to think this is a goof and expect the usual madcap, abrasive chaos of our comedy show.\nThere will be no abrasion. There will be no chaos. We are wanting to do the most experimental show we can do, which in our case is a low-key, cozy, warm-hearted hour of quiet reflection and gentle comedy.This is going to be a soft show for everyone who needs a minute to just breathe. You will laugh, but not enough to hurt your side or upset your neighbor. It will be a laugh held in the liminal space between a deep breath and a long sigh.\nFor folks in which this amount of calm is too stressful, we will also have a Stimulation Booth (provided by Wattie's) available at any time to provide the classic Airhorn jolt they need.

Vignettes of characters similar to you, similar to me, similar to someone you may have been or may one day become, all on the path towards the Amber Temple.\nFrom the bowels of the molten earth, to the jowls of the predatory opportunist, to the angel casting light from celestial constellations, you will find yourself wrapped in a web from a sliver of time, a faraway place, perhaps an unknown space, as musician and dancer weave their tall tales of trials and tribulations, mortal life and looming death, unwavering love and venomous hate, environmentalism and satirical social commentary.\nAn original music and interpretive dance collaboration between singer-songwriter Julian Temple and contemporary dancer Amber Stephens.\nTemple, known mostly for his work in the eponymous Julian Temple Band has written all new works for the project while Stephens, a trained contemporary ballet dancer and choreographer who ran her own dance company in Vienna, has choreographed the interpretive dance for this unique performance.\n\u201cA live dancer added a visceral element to an already emotional performance. Having a responsive artist interacting and interpreting the music through movement only heightened the experience. It bridged the gap between performer and audience.\u201d\n- Ed Castelow - Dictaphone Blues\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be a converted fan of The Amber Temple before they\u2019ve even finished their first song. There\u2019s an obvious sense of originality, coupled with carefully crafted dance moments and some of the most intense and outstanding folk songwriting you\u2019ve heard. There\u2019s a feeling though that nothing is premeditated and that improvisation is the star of the show - the kind of performance that requires decades of experience. Luckily for us, Julian and Amber have this in spades. Do yourself a favour, I guarantee you\u2019ve seen nothing like it.\u201d\n- Sam Cullen - Singer/Songwriter\n\u201cEven having an understanding of the type of show The Amber Temple would be putting on when booking them - I was blown away by the amount of drama, tension and world-building Julian & Amber are able to accomplish in such an agile performance. The Amber Temple is a totally unique and utterly engaging experience which should be seen and celebrated.\u201d\n- Chris Scott - Seaside Music\nShow starts at 7 Presale tickets $20 (+BF) via undertheradar.co.nz or $25 on the door\n\"Vogelmorn Upstairs is not a wheelchair accessible building.

    "description": "NZIFF: Mirrors No. 3, In the wake of a traumatic incident, a young woman forms a surrogate mother-daughter relationship with her rescuer. As emotional walls come down, doubts arise: is there more to the care offered than simple kindness?\n\nLaura and Betty seem to be poles apart. Laura, a young, city dwelling music student, lives in an apartment with her boyfriend; Betty has an adult son and lives alone in rural Germany. Their lives are thrown together after a car accident leaves Laura in the care of the older woman. Despite ostensible differences, each recognises a familiar melancholy in the other. As a tentative trust grows, the women find something unlocking within themselves, even as complicating factors emerge, in the form of Betty\u2019s opaque family situation.\n\nMaster dramatist Christian Petzold reunites with frequent acting collaborator Paula Beer (Transit, Undine, Afire) and regular DOP Hans Fromm, turning his pen and camera to a smaller scale domestic drama. Mirrors No. 3 (named for a Ravel piano piece played within) makes visual and thematic echoes back to Petzold\u2019s previous work: from extended bike rides down rural lanes (Barbara), to the centrality of a piano (Phoenix), as well as the thread of mysterious tension that underlies them all. The film revels in the messy, stimulating complexities of human relationships, exploring the way that sometimes even questionable motivations can affect positive outcomes. \u2014 Jacob Powell",

In the Val-d'Oise region, this community, originally from Turkey and Iraq, has lived since the 1980s in a rhythm marked by weddings, church services, and family meals.\nShaped by the exile of their parents and the persecution their community faced under the Turkish dictatorship and Daesh, S\u00e9miramis nurtures her roots in Assyrian civilization, originating from Mesopotamia. But the puzzle of her history no longer fits together as it once did.\nGradually, the elders are disappearing, taking with them an identity and culture that is 6,000 years old. How can this fracture be repaired, and this heritage preserved? Should they consider staying or returning to their ancestral homeland, now that peace has returned? Can one go back after decades of conflict? Can they rebuild and start anew to live in peace with themselves and others?\n\"Return to Babylon\" is a road movie from Sarcelles to Erbil, following S\u00e9miramis and her family on a journey that leads them to question their future in France and the fate of their community in the Middle East.\nA film by Marie Dault, S\u00e9miramis Ide, and S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nDirected by S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nScreen time: 52-minutes; French and Assyrian with subtitles\nLink to the English-subtitled trailer: https://www.instagram.com/p/DDzsYJzt_B9/\nThe screening event will be held at the Cockburn Street Chapel, 1 Cockburn Street, Kilbirnie, Wellington from 5-7pm.\n\nEntrance is free, but please register to confirm your attendance.\n\nWe welcome koha (donations) which will go towards supporting the ACEYA Wellington Branch's youth-focused activities and events.",

    "description": "NZIFF: Dreams (Sex Love), A teenage girl recounts her crush for her teacher through the pages of a memoir. The winner of the Golden Bear 2025 is a lucid and tender chronicle of the unforgettable experience of first love.\n\nOriginally intended as the second chapter in his trilogy and released in Norway as such, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Dreams ended up premiering internationally as the last. But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

    "description": "Voices from the Moana: Amplifying Pacific stories of healing and resilience, Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Paci\ufb01c style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and e\ufb00ective insights. Tai refers to ocean waters, which represent your opportunity to rise through the ebb and \ufb02ow of this learning journey. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from di\ufb00erent communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from Voices from the Moana?\nIn Voices from the Moana, you will explore and share rich narratives of healing and resilience from different Pacific nations and perspectives. The Pacific ocean is a diverse place and we have our own unique stories of healing through traditional practices, beliefs and methods. This Talanoa Tai learning experience invites reflection on your own understanding of different healing modalities from the Pacific and the impact it has on your worldview. It will equip you to advocate for social justice through Pacific voices. You'll gain practical tolls and insights that you can apply directly to your work.\nThis is a 3 hour in-person learning experience.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\n Facilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives. Fa\u2019aeafale\u2019upolu (Polu) Samuelu is the facilitator of this Talanoa Tai Learning experience.",

Just outside Martinborough, Ruamahanga Farm Foundation are bringing the local community together to help restore wetlands and provide greater access to the awa. The restoration is a foundation for Te Reo o te Wai, an arts and conservation programme for local primary schools.\n\n\nOur hosts Jane Riddiford and Rod Sugden will share the story of the land and the conversion of a traditional stock and crop farm into a regenerative, community oriented venture. They will involve us in some of the experiential ways they are helping children and young people connect to hidden places along the Ruam\u0101hanga. The day will include planting trees and grasses along a new wetland walk combined with nature based story telling, art and creative writing. We will have a shared lunch by the awa or under canvas if it is wet.",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods.

But who says? Whose progress and whose AI is it anyway? Is societal progress really bound to technological innovation, or are there other ways of reading - and even shaping - positive social change?\nTechnological Determinism is described as the belief system that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an \"inevitable\" course.\" This panel will take a good hard look at this 'inevitabilism' - its forces and politics - with a view to our shared future in Aotearoa and the Pacific.\nJoin us for a rigorous evening of discussion with a view to how we might gain more understanding - and more say - as to the reach and influence new technologies have over our autonomy, dignity, communities and cultures.",

Maitreya, the World Teacher, and his group The Masters of Wisdom are here - not as religious teachers - to inspire all people to create a civilisation based on sharing, justice and peace; and for humanity to act to do the work to share and save our world.\n\nHumanity at spiritual crossroads\n\nHumanity is at crossroads. One path into the future leads to increasing social and economic division, environmental destruction, war and planetary peril. The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\n\nMaitreya\u2019s priorities\n\nTo help humanity in its task of global transformation, Maitreya has formulated certain priorities. They cover the essential needs of all people, every woman, man and child: an adequate supply of food\u037e housing for all; healthcare and education as basic universal rights. Other top priorities include the restoration of the environment and the establishment of peace.\n\nThe key to achieving these goals requires a major shift of present mind-set and thinking, structures and systems \u2013 and more equitable sharing of the world\u2019s food and resources. To realise humanity is one global family and the planet is a living being. According to Maitreya: \u201cWithout sharing, there can be no justice; without justice, there can be no peace; without peace, there can be no future.\u201d\n\n~ followed by short Transmission Meditation session ~\n\nShare International New Zealand.
