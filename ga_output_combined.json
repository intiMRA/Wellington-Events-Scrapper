Superior Donuts by Tracy Letts\nStagecraft presents: \u201cSuperior Donuts\u201d\nBy Tracy Letts\nDirected by James Kiesel\n26 November \u2013 6 December 2025\n\n\u201cWhat could be more human, than to be scared, and keep it a secret.\u201d\n\nArthur Przybyszewski (that's (p)Shub-er-shef-ski), is the proprietor of a modest, behind-the-times donut shop in uptown Chicago. He can't seem to find joy in anything these days, not even the donuts he used to take such pride in making by hand. Vandals armed with spray paint, predatory landlords, and that nefarious Starbucks down the road all threaten to unceremoniously snuff out the only thing he's got left.\n\nThat is, until an upstart, ambitious young man shoulders his way into becoming a Superior Donuts employee, and an unlikely friendship (or is it a rivalry?) develops, inspiring both to face the demons they've been hiding from all this time.\n\nThis is a sharp-witted, heartfelt comedy by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts (\u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d) offering a warm and wry take on depression, diversity, and bravery that will leave you feeling all fluffy and sugary on the inside. Plus, who knows, you might get a donut!\n\nGo to the Stagecraft website to book your spot!\n\nhttps://www.stagecraft.co.nz/auditions\n\nAUDITIONS:\nAuditions will be on Saturday 13th & Sunday 14th September, with callbacks the evening of Monday 15th September.\n\nTo book an audition, please fill out the form by 10th September - we'll be in touch to confirm your audition date, time and location. If you have any questions please get in touch at .\n\nRoles (just try your best with accents, coaching available once casting is complete)\n\nArthur Przybyszewski [Male, Polish, 50s - 60s]\nThe owner and operator of Superior Donuts. Old, grumpy, and more than a little depressed. Secretly an artisan and a scholar, he\u2019s spent his whole life running from conflict. Until now? [Has a scene involving some violence]\n\nFranco Wicks [Male, African-American, 20s]\nYoung, idealistic, a little pushy, and full of attitude and energy. Franco believes that good things will happen to him despite all odds, and evidence, to the contrary. A former employee of Luther.\n\nMax [Male, Russian, 40s - 60s]\nOwner of the DVD shop next door, Max is interested in buying Superior Donuts to expand his (tiny) capitalist empire. Fancies himself a self-made man. [Speaks in a Russian accent, along with some dialogue in Russian]\n\nRandy [Female, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nRaised in the middle of 7 brothers and working as a cop in the Chicago Police Department, Randy\u2019s always been \u2018one of the boys\u2019. Big hockey fan. Has a soft spot for Arthur.\n\nJames [Male, African-American, 30s - 40s]\nAnother cop with the Chicago Police Department and Randy\u2019s beat partner. Well-respected in the community and [not so] secretly a giant Star Trek nerd. [Will consider any and all BIPOC actors for this role]\n\nLady [Female, Irish-American, 60s - 70s]\nLikely homeless and definitely a little hard-of-hearing, Lady is a well-known as a confusing-but-likeable, perhaps even mascot-like figure in the Uptown community. Well past the point of giving a crap about what other people think.\n\nLuther [Male, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nLocal bookie and crime-syndicate everyman, Luther has scratched out his living taking money from gambling addicts, which he finds troubling because he\u2019d like to consider himself a good, fair man. Has a stomach ulcer which is probably somehow representative of this inner conflict. [Has a scene involving some violence]\n\nKevin [Male, Irish, 20s]\nAnother of Luther\u2019s employees, Kevin\u2019s probably fallen into the wrong crowd as a young man, but it doesn\u2019t seem to trouble him that much. Seems to care mostly about getting paid and drinking Coca-Cola.\n\nKiril [Male, Russian, 20s - 30s]\nA shy man of few words (mostly \u2018hello\u2019), Kiril is an intimidating figure with a big soft heart beating beneath his tall muscular frame. Brought into the fold to be a construction worker and bodyguard, he\u2019s mostly interested in falling in love with the local bartender. [Most dialogue is in Russian]\n\n",

Shut her eyes. Rolled their names around her brain. Stacked each person in order like folded laundry, warm and crisp from the sun. She wondered how her name would sound amongst them.\n\nIn the rural reaches of Auckland, the women of the eclectic Gordon family gather for Christmas. They may push each other\u2019s buttons, but know precisely when to offer tea (or a tipple). Rita, the 50-year-old baby of the family, is planning to tell them she has cancer. Drifting between past and present, she considers the lives of women in their community and reckons with what it all means for her future and her family.\n\nFeaturing elderly lesbians, twins who aren\u2019t twins, and several dogs named Roger, Hoods Landing is about shoddy pasts, ambiguous futures and the imperfect bonds that tie family together.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nLaura Vincent (Ng\u0101ti M\u0101hanga, Ng\u0101puhi) is an author whose work spans fiction, poetry and food writing. She has written the food blog hungryandfrozen.com since 2007, and her debut cookbook was published by Penguin Random House in 2013. Laura\u2019s poetry has appeared in anthologies published by \u0100poro Press, Auckland University Press and Muswell Press, and she completed her Master of Creative Writing at Auckland University of Technology in 2022. Born in Waiuku, Laura currently lives in T\u0101maki Makaurau. Hoods Landing is her first novel.\n\n",

    "description": "Auditions! Superior Donuts by Tracy Letts, Auditions! Superior Donuts by Tracy Letts\nStagecraft presents: \u201cSuperior Donuts\u201d\nBy Tracy Letts\nDirected by James Kiesel\n26 November \u2013 6 December 2025\n\n\u201cWhat could be more human, than to be scared, and keep it a secret.\u201d\n\nArthur Przybyszewski (that's (p)Shub-er-shef-ski), is the proprietor of a modest, behind-the-times donut shop in uptown Chicago. He can't seem to find joy in anything these days, not even the donuts he used to take such pride in making by hand. Vandals armed with spray paint, predatory landlords, and that nefarious Starbucks down the road all threaten to unceremoniously snuff out the only thing he's got left.\n\nThat is, until an upstart, ambitious young man shoulders his way into becoming a Superior Donuts employee, and an unlikely friendship (or is it a rivalry?) develops, inspiring both to face the demons they've been hiding from all this time.\n\nThis is a sharp-witted, heartfelt comedy by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts (\u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d) offering a warm and wry take on depression, diversity, and bravery that will leave you feeling all fluffy and sugary on the inside. Plus, who knows, you might get a donut!\n\nGo to the Stagecraft website to book your spot!\n\nhttps://www.stagecraft.co.nz/auditions\n\nAUDITIONS:\nAuditions will be on Saturday 13th & Sunday 14th September, with callbacks the evening of Monday 15th September.\n\nTo book an audition, please fill out the form by 10th September - we'll be in touch to confirm your audition date, time and location. If you have any questions please get in touch at .\n\nRoles (just try your best with accents, coaching available once casting is complete)\n\nArthur Przybyszewski [Male, Polish, 50s - 60s]\nThe owner and operator of Superior Donuts. Old, grumpy, and more than a little depressed. Secretly an artisan and a scholar, he\u2019s spent his whole life running from conflict. Until now? [Has a scene involving some violence]\n\nFranco Wicks [Male, African-American, 20s]\nYoung, idealistic, a little pushy, and full of attitude and energy. Franco believes that good things will happen to him despite all odds, and evidence, to the contrary. A former employee of Luther.\n\nMax [Male, Russian, 40s - 60s]\nOwner of the DVD shop next door, Max is interested in buying Superior Donuts to expand his (tiny) capitalist empire. Fancies himself a self-made man. [Speaks in a Russian accent, along with some dialogue in Russian]\n\nRandy [Female, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nRaised in the middle of 7 brothers and working as a cop in the Chicago Police Department, Randy\u2019s always been \u2018one of the boys\u2019. Big hockey fan. Has a soft spot for Arthur.\n\nJames [Male, African-American, 30s - 40s]\nAnother cop with the Chicago Police Department and Randy\u2019s beat partner. Well-respected in the community and [not so] secretly a giant Star Trek nerd. [Will consider any and all BIPOC actors for this role]\n\nLady [Female, Irish-American, 60s - 70s]\nLikely homeless and definitely a little hard-of-hearing, Lady is a well-known as a confusing-but-likeable, perhaps even mascot-like figure in the Uptown community. Well past the point of giving a crap about what other people think.\n\nLuther [Male, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nLocal bookie and crime-syndicate everyman, Luther has scratched out his living taking money from gambling addicts, which he finds troubling because he\u2019d like to consider himself a good, fair man. Has a stomach ulcer which is probably somehow representative of this inner conflict. [Has a scene involving some violence]\n\nKevin [Male, Irish, 20s]\nAnother of Luther\u2019s employees, Kevin\u2019s probably fallen into the wrong crowd as a young man, but it doesn\u2019t seem to trouble him that much. Seems to care mostly about getting paid and drinking Coca-Cola.\n\nKiril [Male, Russian, 20s - 30s]\nA shy man of few words (mostly \u2018hello\u2019), Kiril is an intimidating figure with a big soft heart beating beneath his tall muscular frame. Brought into the fold to be a construction worker and bodyguard, he\u2019s mostly interested in falling in love with the local bartender. [Most dialogue is in Russian]\n\n",

Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it's going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa. Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you're a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show digs deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, family, and the undeniable need to keep moving\u2014no matter how creaky your knees may be.\n\nGet ready to laugh, reflect, and maybe even wince in recognition as GOMIL pedals its way across the country this spring. It\u2019s more than a show\u2014it\u2019s a celebration of growing older (and slightly wider) with humour, heart, and a healthy dose of spandex.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next chapter in this iconic Kiwi comedy saga. GOMIL is coming to a theatre near you - lycra, laughter and all.\n\n--\nFor accessibility seating information and wheelchair space bookings please email or call 04)9740535 during office hours.\n\n",

    "description": "Messengers, \u2018Animals first entered the imagination as messengers and promises,\u2019 John Berger.\nMessengers explores the enduring gaze shared between humans and other animals. The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

    "description": "The Overthinking Mind - Break Free From Mental Loops, Tuesday Wellbeing Seminars\n\nThe Overthinking Mind - Tap to break free from mental loops\n\nThis workshop explores why our thoughts get stuck in loops of worry, doubt, and replay.  Drawing on the insights of Carl Jung, we\u2019ll uncover how the unconscious mind, shadow, and how unresolved inner conflicts fuel over-thinking. You\u2019ll also learn how the body and nervous system become conditioned to repeat these mental patterns, creating the familiar cycle of racing thoughts and restless emotions.\n\nThrough a guided exercise, you\u2019ll experience practical tools from FasterEFT and the science of neuroplasticity\u2014methods that help rewire the brain and bring the mind back to calm clarity.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, you\u2019ll not only understand the deeper roots of over-thinking, but you\u2019ll also walk away with simple, repeatable techniques to interrupt mental loops, ease the nervous system, and create a lasting sense of inner peace.\n\n\u201cThis is an interactive workshop where you\u2019ll connect with others and see that many of us face the same challenges beneath the surface\u2014making growth and healing easier when we explore them together :)\n\n\u201cThis is an interactive workshop that offers the chance to connect with others on a similar journey. It\u2019s powerful to know, that beneath the surface, we often share the same challenges and struggles\u2014and that healing becomes easier when we explore them together.\u201d\n\nMeet your host, Krishnaloka\n\nIntroducing Krishnaloka, who is driven to help others overcome their issues within their mind and pyschology. As a mind technician trained in eutaptics (Faster EFT), she employs the fastest and most powerful method to create lasting change by addressing the root causes of issues rather than just the symptoms. Her warm and caring nature makes every interaction with her both comforting and transformative.",

In Over and Out, premiering at the 2025 TAHI Festival, Burling brings a real interview, a big character, and even bigger questions to the stage.\n\nOne actor. 50 minutes. Countless emotional potholes. Along the way, we get a rare look into the gritty, heartfelt, and often-overlooked life of one of Aotearoa\u2019s essential workers: the truck driver. Is the open road calling \u2014 or is the stage his true destination? Buckle up. This is verbatim theatre with serious mileage.\n\nAudience Care: Contains coarse language and mature themes.",

Amy Marguerite (over under fed), Sophie van Waardenberg (No Good), and Emma Barnes (IF WE KNEW HOW TO WE WOULD) talk with Anna Jackson about the conditionality of rapture, the loveliness of loneliness, the difficulty of living in a hungry body, how it has felt to keep writing through a pandemic, heart-break and grief, and why it matters to make space for metaphor and memory, for sparrows and bees and a guinea-pig, eating a dandelion, its mouth full of gold.\nWriters on Mondays is presented by the International Institute of Modern Letters and Te Papa Tongarewa. The 2025 series will run from 12.15\u20141.15 pm each Monday from 7 July to 29 September at Te Papa Tongarewa and Circa Theatre, with two special evening sessions at Meow.

    "description": "Temporal Aria, Temporal Aria\nA breathtaking contemporary circus spectacle exploring the profound tension between control and surrender.\n\nAbout this Event\n\n\nWINNER - Momentous Movement Award (NZ Fringe 2025)\nWINNER - Take Your Breath Away Award (Reykjavik Fringe 2025)\n\nStep into a world where gravity bends and the boundaries of the human body are redefined. Temporal Aria is a breathtaking contemporary circus experience that fuses the ancient art of hair suspension with acrobatics to explore the profound tension between control and surrender.\nInspired by performer Nicole Maisey\u2019s recent ADHD diagnosis, the show becomes a deeply personal exploration of distractibility, executive dysfunction, and the pursuit of inner peace. Through feats of extraordinary strength and vulnerability, Nicole transforms struggle into artistry, expressing a journey toward balance and self-acceptance.\nAt its heart, Temporal Aria is about learning to release control and accept support, a powerful shift from isolation to connection. As Nicole navigates the physical and emotional extremes of her art, she discovers that surrender is not weakness, but a pathway to strength, resilience, and unexpected grace.\nSet to a mesmerizing soundscape, Temporal Aria is both a spectacle and a meditation. a poetic intersection of circus, emotion, and identity. It\u2019s not just about the act of letting go, but about what we discover in the process: joy, contentment, and the redefinition of success as peace within.\nPrepare to be captivated by a performance that truly takes your breath away.\n\n",

    "description": "The Monster in the Maze, The myth of the Minotaur is a tale almost as old as storytelling itself, but with The Monster in the Maze Jonathan Dove and Alisdair Middleton have excavated rich, new life from this classic. In this brand new staging by director Anapela Polataivao (Red White and Brass, Wild Dogs Under My Skirt), this story will be told as never before.\n\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he metes out his punishment in the cruellest way possible: by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth, to be fed to the terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze: the Minotaur. As King Minos triumphs, his great monster \u201cwill eat your future, it will rip your hope, it will stamp your youth, your children in the sand.\u201d\n\nAs the vindictive king will soon learn, however, these youth will not accept their fate without a fierce challenge. The Monster in the Maze is a story about resistance; about justice; about finding power not in oppression, but in collectivism. Fittingly, then, it\u2019s also a groundbreaking work in its form: a community-focused and community-driven opera in which young and community singers and players stand proudly shoulder-to-shoulder with their professional counterparts, and in which both are integral.\n\nThe Monster in the Maze has been roundly praised by audiences, participants and reviewers worldwide, and in its Aotearoa debut season, it will serve as a gorgeous articulation of New Zealand Opera\u2019s reciprocal community kaupapa.\n\nSung in English with surtitles.",

    "description": "The Liberal International Order as a Core-Periphery Order: An Alternative History with Multiple Deep Contestations, I offer an alternative macrohistory of the Liberal International Order (LIO) that was explicitly designed to perpetuate Western dominance and American hegemony. The LIO is better understood as a core-periphery order because inequality between the Western-core and the \u2018Restern\u2019-periphery was constitutive of it. (Re-)Imperialism\u2014not just liberalism\u2014remained a central ordering mechanism well after 1945. I show the two-way deep contestations between the liberal and anticolonial ordering projects, especially at the 1955 Bandung Conference. Contra the post-LIO pessimism of disorder/chaos, I argue that the normative agency of the Southeast Asian states informed by the legacy of Bandung is heralding a multiplex, multi-regional world order. As the declining inequality between the West and Asia transforms the core-periphery LIO, the emergent decentered world order will lack a core, whether Western/liberal or Asian. This deep transformation should be welcomed, not deeply contested, although coexistence and global integration require embracing deep pluralism, not liberalism.\nManjeet S. Pardesi is Associate Professor of International Relations in the Political Science and International Relations Programme, and Asia Research Fellow at the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. His research interests include World Orders and World/Global History, Great Power Politics, Asian security, and the Sino-Indian rivalry. His most recent book, Divergent Worlds: What the Ancient Mediterranean and Indian Ocean Can Tell Us About the Future of International Order (co-authored with Amitav Acharya) was published by Yale University Press in 2025.",

We had sessions ranging from how to use AI in your org, founder transitions, and even a photographer taking new head shots for folk. \nThe price of the ticket covers a koha to the venue and for some coffee/snacks.

This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations.

I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible.

    "description": "5 days Figure Sculpting workshop with model, 5 days Figure Sculpting workshop with model\nThe immediacy of the model\u2019s presence encourages close observation and instinctive decision-making leading to work that is expressive and real. This hands-on interaction brings a sense of movement and authenticity that\u2019s hard to achieve otherwise.\n\nThe sculpting process typically starts by analyzing the model\u2019s proportions and pose. A wire armature is built to support the structure and clay is gradually applied to develop the form to a one-third life size 750mm tall figure. From there the artist refines the shapes focusing on anatomical accuracy and expressive detail that give the sculpture its final character.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in traditional sculpture and the film industry Javier is not just a sculptor \u2014 he\u2019s a mentor. Trained in classical techniques he studied fine arts and took anatomy courses at medical school developing a rare combination of artistic and anatomical knowledge. He spent over five years at the world-renowned Weta Workshop contributing to major films and exhibitions and has worked across materials scales and digital technologies.\n\nMaterial is included in the price.\nArmature is supplied during the workshop.\nYou can buy our tools during the workshop if you like.\nTea\n\n",

Over five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nDescription\nMany of us live sedentary lifestyles, sitting for up to eight hours or more a day hunched over our keyboard - all the while rarely taking a proper breath! Even if we wanted to take a deep enriching breath into the lower lobes of our lungs, we are limited due to our posture. Often due to the stresses and strains of a busy work and life balance, our unconscious brain can develop a pattern of holding, irregular and shadow breaths.\n\nDoes this sound like your experience?\n\nNot being able to breathe properly is the key cause of many chronic respiratory diseases (Nestor, 2020)\n\nCalligratherapy combines science journalist James Nestor's theory on proper breathing with the philosophy of ancient Chinese calligraphy to promote a state of optimal wellbeing.\n\nCalligratherapy has been developed specifically for those who have never practiced calligraphy before and who are interested in deriving the benefits without having to learn the language or all the characters. It integrates the simple and intuitive act of inhaling and exhaling into calligraphy practice with Eastern philosophy behind it.\n\nA range of different breathing exercises are embedded into each 90-minute session focusing on different calligraphy scripts. Over the five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing, while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nAll materials included in course fee.\n\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:\n\nStart a new creative practice in Chinese soft brush calligraphy\nDevelop your own mindfulness strategy\nBetter manage everyday stress levels and access a calm, empowered and positive state of mind\nFind ways to explore eastern philosophy and develop deeper connections with your spiritual self.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

And cracks are showing everywhere. So much that we thought was secure is shifting and changing. \nBut here in Aotearoa, we have an extraordinary pou\u2014Te Tiriti o Waitangi.\nCome along for a day of depth; exploring the amazing potential that the relational space of Te Tiriti has for us all. This one is for tangata Tiriti who are deeply committed to an ethic of restoration in Aotearoa and want to go beyond an intellectual understanding.\nJoin Rebecca and Mel from The P\u0101keh\u0101 Project for this one-day workshop exploring the mahi we as tangata Tiriti can do in the journey towards a Tiriti-led future. Using practices of Haumanu, a healing-centred approach to systems change, we\u2019ll be inquiring into our own roles in reweaving the relational fabric that Te Tiriti o Waitangi offered to all people in Aotearoa, but that did not happen at the time.\nWe invite you into a space for gently inquiring into your unique place in the system rewiring itself. How do we show up where M\u0101ori are calling us to be? We'll be exploring relationality and worldview; the nervous system as map for working with activation; systemic racism, the orthodox Western worldview\u2014its whakapapa and how it shows up in ourselves, our systems and society; and our roles in restorative systems change for a Tiriti-based future. It will be interactive, embodied, and nourishing.\nLet's create islands of coherence in this turbulent world.\nWe'll host you upstairs at Vogelmorn Bowling Club, in the beautiful hills of Brooklyn, Te Whanganui-a-Tara. There'll be delicious kai, and a chance to resource yourself, in communion with others.

Over five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nDescription\nMany of us live sedentary lifestyles, sitting for up to eight hours or more a day hunched over our keyboard - all the while rarely taking a proper breath! Even if we wanted to take a deep enriching breath into the lower lobes of our lungs, we are limited due to our posture. Often due to the stresses and strains of a busy work and life balance, our unconscious brain can develop a pattern of holding, irregular and shadow breaths.\n\nDoes this sound like your experience?\n\nNot being able to breathe properly is the key cause of many chronic respiratory diseases (Nestor, 2020)\n\nCalligratherapy combines science journalist James Nestor's theory on proper breathing with the philosophy of ancient Chinese calligraphy to promote a state of optimal wellbeing.\n\nCalligratherapy has been developed specifically for those who have never practiced calligraphy before and who are interested in deriving the benefits without having to learn the language or all the characters. It integrates the simple and intuitive act of inhaling and exhaling into calligraphy practice with Eastern philosophy behind it.\n\nA range of different breathing exercises are embedded into each 90-minute session focusing on different calligraphy scripts. Over the five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing, while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nAll materials included in course fee.\n\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:\n\nStart a new creative practice in Chinese soft brush calligraphy\nDevelop your own mindfulness strategy\nBetter manage everyday stress levels and access a calm, empowered and positive state of mind\nFind ways to explore eastern philosophy and develop deeper connections with your spiritual self.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

Jem's debut graphic novel Folk Remedy Book 1 releases in September 2025, and she's busy working on Book 2.

In this workshop Jem will share some of the strategies, habits and tools she uses to fit in making graphic novels alongside full time employment without burning out. This session is practice-agnostic, and is designed to facilitate discussion about what a sustainable art practice can look like, how to build one, and how we can support each other when things are tough. No resources required but feel free to bring any notebooks or tools you use to manage your art or your time\n\nAfter that, we\u2019ll share some kai (potluck style), have a relaxed k\u014drero\nThe gathering will be held at a cozy private space in Wellington CBD, easily accessible by public transport.\nMessage us for the exact location: easternsoundcollective@gmail.com\nOr reach out on Instagram/Facebook: @easternsoundcollective\n",

    "description": "Jewellery-making in 8 weeks - Tuesday Eve Mixed Level, This class is mixed level, allowing beginners to work alongside advanced students. It starts on Tuesday, 14 October and runs for 8 weeks till Tuesday, 2 December, 5.30pm - 8pm.\nOur popular weeknight classes are the best way for beginners to get into jewellery making in a lively, warm and friendly environment.\n\nBeginners start with basic ring-making and stone-setting in copper or brass. Students will learn measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting and soldering. Then we move on to making a practice-ring set with a Cabochon stone (cabochon means it has a flat bottom and a smooth domed top) in a Bezel Setting. The stone-setting process teaches you many fundamental techniques in one project! As you work through your practice-ring and setting, you can move onto working in silver and produce another ring with a cabachon stone that you really love. This way you will learn the basics as you go on your practice-ring, before taking the next step in costly silver.\n\nLevel 2 students learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking as a way to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project so they have something to hone their skills that they are familiar with, as well as taking on a new skill. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet or a more complex bezel setting - for example a teardrop or soft square stone to take on bezels with corners!\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple projects they can work on self-directed in class: more chains or simple bezel settings are ideal - to help them strengthen their soldering skills - alongside a challenge project that might be a shelf setting (an adaptation of a bezel setting that can take faceted stones), a tube setting or a larger bezel setting for a box or brooch. Our tutors will work with you to discover your passions in the world of making, and to support your skills so you grow your understanding with each block you take. We recommend that students from level 3 and up take the occasional Technique class (for example - claw setting, enamelling, flush setting) and then bring those techniques into their projects in their block class to be supported in their practice and skill by their regular tutor.\n\nThis class fee does NOT include materials for any student.\nBeginners should expect to spend at least $60 on materials for their ring making project.\nAll metals and stones as well as quality findings and chains are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it thriftily in future projects!\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time please email us to arrange this ;)",

    "description": "Jewellery Making - Precious Stones in Cast Rings, Create sculptural rings studded with dazzling precious gemstones!

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene and GIB.\nCPD points: 10\nTIMING:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLECTURE DATES:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

This will be an evening to feast your ears on a diverse soundscape of angular guitars, melodic goodness, and glorious noise.\n\nHere\u2019s the lo-down:\n\nFirst Reserve is inevitable. Before adopting the moniker in 2023, Ryan Connaghan had been prolifically writing music that communicated their experiences in life, love, and loneliness. These themes are all approached on songs like \u201cLast One\u201d and \u201cMe & My Friends\u201d \u2013 the first offerings from First Reserve\u2019s debut EP set for release in late 2025. On stage, their sound is both intimate and larger-than-life, combining influences from alt-rock, indie-folk, and pop.\n\nDropper combines intuitive songwriting sensibilities with wall-of-sound, guitar.  Blending noise and melody, Dropper is dynamic, song-centred, high-energy indie rock. Often compared to Bob Mould\u2019s work with H\u00fcsker D\u00fc or Lou Barlow's early Sebadoh, they\u2019ve been described by one review as having a \"high energy stage performance punctuated by flawless musicianship and songwriting skills that seems beyond the years...Honestly, it\u2019s hard to overstate how impressed I was with Dropper and am eagerly awaiting my next chance to see them live.\u201d\n\nElly Mae's music encapsulates the bittersweet complexities of growth, relationships, time escaping, and the nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, shoegaze and whatnot.\n\nGrab your general release tickets online for just $15!

Vignettes of characters similar to you, similar to me, similar to someone you may have been or may one day become, all on the path towards the Amber Temple.\nFrom the bowels of the molten earth, to the jowls of the predatory opportunist, to the angel casting light from celestial constellations, you will find yourself wrapped in a web from a sliver of time, a faraway place, perhaps an unknown space, as musician and dancer weave their tall tales of trials and tribulations, mortal life and looming death, unwavering love and venomous hate, environmentalism and satirical social commentary.\nAn original music and interpretive dance collaboration between singer-songwriter Julian Temple and contemporary dancer Amber Stephens.\nTemple, known mostly for his work in the eponymous Julian Temple Band has written all new works for the project while Stephens, a trained contemporary ballet dancer and choreographer who ran her own dance company in Vienna, has choreographed the interpretive dance for this unique performance.\n\u201cA live dancer added a visceral element to an already emotional performance. Having a responsive artist interacting and interpreting the music through movement only heightened the experience. It bridged the gap between performer and audience.\u201d\n- Ed Castelow - Dictaphone Blues\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be a converted fan of The Amber Temple before they\u2019ve even finished their first song. There\u2019s an obvious sense of originality, coupled with carefully crafted dance moments and some of the most intense and outstanding folk songwriting you\u2019ve heard. There\u2019s a feeling though that nothing is premeditated and that improvisation is the star of the show - the kind of performance that requires decades of experience. Luckily for us, Julian and Amber have this in spades. Do yourself a favour, I guarantee you\u2019ve seen nothing like it.\u201d\n- Sam Cullen - Singer/Songwriter\n\u201cEven having an understanding of the type of show The Amber Temple would be putting on when booking them - I was blown away by the amount of drama, tension and world-building Julian & Amber are able to accomplish in such an agile performance. The Amber Temple is a totally unique and utterly engaging experience which should be seen and celebrated.\u201d\n- Chris Scott - Seaside Music\nShow starts at 7 Presale tickets $20 (+BF) via undertheradar.co.nz or $25 on the door\n\"Vogelmorn Upstairs is not a wheelchair accessible building. There is an accessible\nbathroom in the space. This is an all ages venue but those under the age of 16 must be\naccompanied by a designated adult after 8pm.

If you're like us and have a box of clothing in need of repairs that never seems to empty... this is the club for you. With three events a month we'll inspire each other to creatively care for those pieces we love! This club is also perfect for anyone who loves learning new skills. Techniques we'll cover are lino printing, patching, darning, felting, embroidery, beading, sashiko, fabric painting and more! All materials and tools are supplied at each class - but you are welcome to bring your own. We highly encourage bringing those clothes or other textile items that need some love and repair.\nThere is no need to attend every class. We can catch you up on the skill at which ever class you choose to join us at. There are single class tickets or monthly sign ups available. Both of these have variable pricing options, unwaged/student, waged, and generous. Please choose whichever option feels right for you and your circumstances!\nIn August we are Lino Printing!\nClass 02: 20th August\nAt this class Aisha will take us through the process of designing and cutting our own lino to print with! You're welcome to keep going with the pre cut designs as well. Lino and carving tools will be supplied.\nClass 03: 27th August\nThis class will be open to what you want to work on! Bring in larger project items, print with the lino cuts you made in the previous week, or cut some fresh ones!\nIn September we are patching!\nClass 01: 10th September\nAisha will take us through the process of sewing on patches. Patches that we printed in the August classes will be available for this. You're welcome to bring your own patches as well. Please bring something that needs a patch up or a little bit of decoration.\nClass 02: 17th September\nAt this class we will learn how to appliqu\u00e9, the process of using scrap fabric to make decorative patches. This is a great way to elevate a rip or stain with some visible mending.\nClass 03: 24th September\nAt this last class of the month we'll be open for all the patching needs. Hang out and finish projects we've started or mend some extra items.\nBe sure to check our website or here for updates about techniques coming up in the following months.",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene.\nTiming:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLecture dates:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

Books have played an important role in Mike\u2019s life, taking him from student librarian to author of two books himself.\nMike\u2019s latest book, 'Speaking My Language | Te K\u014drero i T\u014dku Reo', explores his deeply personal journey into Te Reo M\u0101ori and Te Ao M\u0101ori - captured in his acclaimed documentary, 'Kia Ora, Good Evening'.\nThe evening will begin with a glass of Hunter\u2019s Wines\u2019 award-winning MiruMiru\u2122 and delicious canap\u00e9s. A non-alcoholic option will also be available.\nThis event is being held to raise funds for our Category 1 Historic Place and writer\u2019s museum in Thorndon, which is open six days a week. We offer an annual programme of events and activities designed to encourage creativity and we host school and tour groups to share the life, literature and legacy of Katherine Mansfield. ",

Through practical insights, open discussion, and guidance from the Gita\u2019s philosophy, we\u2019ll look at how to build resilience\u2014not only by steadying the nervous system, but by exploring the deeper self beyond the changing body and mind.\nMeet your host, Sivananda\nSivananda\u2019s background is in both science and music, holding a Master's Degree in Data Science, a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a long history of playing and performing on the double bass. His passion for philosophy, music, good food and community attracted him to the bhakti lifestyle.

Hopes and fears steer the young women towards bettering their lives for themselves and their children.\n\nYoung Mothers examines the lives of underprivileged teenagers as they come to terms with motherhood for the first time. Living together temporarily in a group home, they are taught how to care for their babies, while grappling with very different personal circumstances.

Julie considers giving up her daughter for adoption, yet her own troubled mother wishes to raise the child to atone for her past mistakes. Brought up by an alcoholic mother, Perla dreams of a stable family, but her delinquent boyfriend wants nothing to do with her or their child. While Ariane has the privilege of a loving partner, both are recovering drug addicts which presents its own challenges.\n\nThis is a story of hope told through characters looking for a future free from their past. \u2014 Madison Marshall",

John Campbell highlights some consistent themes of Brian Tamaki's Destiny Church: far-right prejudices, manifest anger, and hatred.\nIn Auckland on 21 June, Destiny Church organised a march to take \"a bold public stand for Christian values, Kiwi identity and the future of this nation\".\nOn Saturday, 13 September, Brian Tamaki attended the London \u201cUnite the Kingdom\u201d protest organised by far-right political activist Tommy Robinson that claimed to celebrate 'free speech', but also contained chants of hate, racist conspiracy theories, and Christian nationalist slogans. Among disturbing scenes, some people in the crowd ripped up a flag that read 'Secular Humanism'. To them, the very idea that people of all backgrounds and beliefs can live together with equality and respect is something to fear and destroy. For decades, the far right in the USA has painted humanism as a bogeyman, blaming it for liberal values, the rights of women, and the rights of LGBT people. It shows that those who thrive on fear are deliberately targeting the very values that underpin human rights and human dignity. Humanism is not a fringe or \u2018woke\u2019 idea. It is about fairness. It is about reason. It is about believing in the good that people are capable of when they are free to live their lives without fear or prejudice. These protests, which Brian Tamaki is supporting, are a show of force from those who wish to undo progress, to divide communities, and to undermine cherished freedoms.\nWe have a growing concern for secular values in our community. We cannot be silent. It is essential to keep compassion alive in public life and politics.

We will explore how attitudes have changed since our first baseline survey in 2017, and what these results mean for advancing gender equality in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nWe will be hosting an amazing group of speakers on the day to talk about the Survey results and what that means for gender equality in New Zealand. More information will be available on this page when speakers are confirmed. Watch the space!\nSpeakers\nHost, Suzanne Manning, President, NCWNZ\nSuzanne Manning is the current President of NCWNZ, having been involved for 20 years as a member.

    "description": "October Full Moon Drumming, Please remember this is a ZERO WASTE and *NO ALCOHOL* community gathering.\nKia ora!\nFull Moon Drumming Wellington is a registered public event with the Wellington City Council. We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Driftwood from nearby south coast beaches is often abundant, feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page. The less cars driving the better.\nFeel free to share the event page and send an event invite to whomever you feel would be interested, not everyone sees the notifications and advertising ",

This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day.

This immersive sound journey offers a deeply restorative experience that invites you to settle into stillness, reconnect with the heart, and explore a sense of inner spaciousness through vibration and tone.\nClaudio skilfully layers the sounds of gongs, crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, Native American flutes, and other traditional instruments, enhanced through high-quality audio equipment so the sound can be both heard and felt throughout your body.\nHarmonic sound and vibration offer the nervous system a chance to truly rest. In this state of relaxation, the thinking mind softens, and we find connection to citta \u2014 the heart-mind. From this place, silence arises naturally through the vehicle of sound.\nThis experience is open to everyone. No previous yoga or meditation practice is needed.\n\nWhat to bring:\nYou are welcome to bring your own yoga mat, though studio mats are also available. We will provide bolsters, blankets, and eye pillows for your comfort.\n\nBooking is essential \u2014 spaces are limited and this event often fills quickly.\n\nAbout Claudio\nClaudio is a multi-instrumentalist musician originally from Mexico City and now based in Wellington. Born into a family of musicians, he began playing music at a young age and later studied classical guitar. His journey led him to Montreal, where he explored jazz, world music, and spiritual sound traditions.\n\nExtensive travels in Asia and Europe deepened his connection with Indian music and yogic philosophy. He studied Tibetan singing bowls in Kathmandu and Varanasi, and has since worked with a wide range of instruments including the sitar, esraj, bansuri, harmonium, flutes, gongs, and voice.\n\nClaudio\u2019s work blends technical skill, deep presence, and a profound respect for the healing power of sound.\n\nLearn more or listen to Claudio\u2019s music here:\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/claudioescutiasounds\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/claudio_yoga_sound_healing\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/soundhealingyogamusicclaudio\n\n\n",

    "description": "NZIFF: Went Up the Hill, An unsettling, sinister slow-burn thriller, Samuel Van Grinsven unites rising star Dacre Montgomery with Phantom Thread\u2019s Vicky Krieps and New Zealand\u2019s own Sarah Peirse for a supernatural chiller like no other.\n\nIn the icy, shadow-stricken world of Went Up the Hill\u2019s Christchurch, it would seem that the death of Elizabeth, wife of Jill (Vicky Krieps), has taken with it warmth itself. The unexpected suicide of her partner has left her a hollowed-out shell \u2013 that is, until Jack (Dacre Montgomery), Elizabeth\u2019s long-absent son, arrives at the funeral, apparently invited by Jill herself, though she does not remember doing so.\n\nThe circumstances of Jack\u2019s long absence are unclear \u2013 all that is known is that Jack was given up for adoption at a very young age. Staying the night at Jill and Elizabeth\u2019s oppressive, concrete-clad mountain abode, it quickly becomes clear that the spirit of Elizabeth has not yet departed \u2013 instead, she has gained the ability to possess both wife and son and is utilising this ability to linger and address the needs of either relationship. What initially seems to be a gift from beyond, however, begins to sour when long-hidden secrets of the past begin to emerge, and lines between the two begin to be crossed.\n\nThe sophomore feature of Samuel Van Grinsven, Went Up the Hill is a wintry, gothic affair, and a showcase for the untapped talents of Montgomery, who most will recognise as the golden-haired, ill-fated muscle mutt Billy from Stranger Things. Essentially a two-hander (with occasional, welcome interjection from Kiwi legend Sarah Peirse as Jack\u2019s frosty, mystery-shrouded aunt), Van Grinsven tracks the trajectory of these two adrift people and the spirit between them \u2013 from unexpected refuge, to joy, to dread \u2013 with a purposeful, drip-fed escalation of tension. Questions of control, abuse and the lingering weight of past scars take hold, all while the usually pleasantly scenic Christchurch landscape is transformed into a suffocatingly claustrophobic ice prison. Van Grinsven\u2019s muscular direction bears none of the flashy excesses of an emerging filmmaker \u2013 his vision emerges, stately, imposing and fully-formed. \u2014 Tom Augustine",

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Porirua will show you how.  \nMost Porirua homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nPorirua has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric.

Through slow, mindful stretches, we begin softening tension and grounding into the present.\n\nYou\u2019ll then be guided through two styles of breathwork \u2014 each offering a unique pathway inward. There\u2019s no pressure or expectation, just the freedom to explore what feels right for you:\n\nA dynamic, connected breath for those who wish to build energy, move emotion, or break through internal blockages\n\nA slow, rhythmic breath for those seeking stillness, calm, and deeper grounding\n\nBoth approaches invite a sense of spaciousness \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally \u2014 while supporting nervous system balance and inner clarity.\n\nTo gently close the session, we\u2019ll move into a quiet, nurturing meditation to support integration and leave you feeling steady, clear, and connected.\n\nAfterwards, stay and enjoy a nourishing plant-based dinner and dessert, lovingly prepared to complement the experience \u2014 because healing is also about how we feed and care for ourselves.\n\nWhy Breathwork?\n\nBreathwork has helped so many shift from a state of tension and overwhelm into a place of ease, clarity, and resilience \u2014 often after just one session. It\u2019s a simple, powerful practice that reconnects you to your body, your breath, and your inner stillness.\n\nYou\u2019ll leave feeling more grounded, more present, and more like yourself again.\n\nMeet Karla, your host\nKarla is a breathwork and trauma-somatic facilitator based in Aotearoa (New Zealand), originally from Malta. With over a decade of experience in Reiki and three years facilitating trauma-informed, science-based breathwork, Karla combines holistic tools, meditation, and conscious breathing to support nervous system regulation and deep emotional healing. Her offerings help release stored trauma, reduce stress and anxiety, and activate oxytocin\u2014the \u201clove hormone\u201d\u2014fostering connection, vitality, and a sense of wholeness.

Nothing is ever so simple.\n\nThis genre-defying work of dance, theatre, live film, clown and absurd philosophising takes the idea of the \u2018trigger warning\u2019 to its absurdist extreme to question how \u2018informed\u2019 consent can really be, and asking \u2018How much do you really want to know?\u2019\n\nCreated and performed by multi-award-winning maverick of the stage Eliza Sanders, Manage Your Expectations helps us to see the limits of the power to communicate and our failures to say what we mean. Through movement, multimedia, and razor-sharp wit, it examines the impossibility of perfect communication, musing on the influence of context, identity and personal history while creating something beautiful from our collective mess.\n\n\u201cClever, witty, evocative, subversive, immersive, despairing, poignant, personal and universal\u201d \u2014 Deirdre Tarrant, Theatreview\n\n\u201cBeautifully vulnerable\u201d \u2013 Chloe Jaques, Theatreview, 2024\n\nFull of vigour, energy, chaos and a hint of confrontation, Manage Your Expectations is a mind (and body) bending show about how we connect in an increasingly complex world. And you decide the ending\u2026\n\nContent warning: this show contains explicit content, mild coarse language, heavy nudity, themes of abortion and rape.\n\nWINNER: Best Performer, Whang\u0101rei Fringe 2024\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance, NZ Fringe 2024\nWINNER: San Diego Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Best in Fringe, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Innovative Work, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Sydney Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Auckland Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Melbourne Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Adelaide Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Original Production, Wellington Theatre Awards 2024\n\nTues 16 \u2013 Sat 20 Sept 2025\nQ&A and Choose Your Price Night: Wed 17 Sept\nRelaxed Performance: Thurs 18 Sept\nCirca Two\nTues \u2013 Fri 7.30pm, Sat 20 Sept 2.00pm & 7.30pm\nShow Duration: 75 minutes no interval\nRecommended Age 16+",

This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\n",

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

The handwork room is lovingly and thoughtfully prepared with the sensory experiences and impressions of the young child in mind.\n\nOther parents are busy with tasks like creating Christmas crackers and decorations and researching new and exciting tantalizing recipes for the two cafes.\n\nThe Teaching faculty gathers students' work, from Kindergarten to Class 12 (Year 13), which are on display in the Eurythmy Room. If you have ever wondered what a main lesson book is you are bound to find one, or more, here!\n\nTo ensure there is fun for everyone we even create games to play both indoors and out. Then to add to the atmosphere during the day you will hear the sound of music and singing, and even some dancing while enjoying an organic coffee. The School Fair is a great day for all.\n\nSkip the traffic - There is very limited parking around the school area, so please make use of our Fair Shuttle Bus - every 30 minutes to and from Melling Station.

    "description": "NZIFF: Went Up the Hill, An unsettling, sinister slow-burn thriller, Samuel Van Grinsven unites rising star Dacre Montgomery with Phantom Thread\u2019s Vicky Krieps and New Zealand\u2019s own Sarah Peirse for a supernatural chiller like no other.\n\nIn the icy, shadow-stricken world of Went Up the Hill\u2019s Christchurch, it would seem that the death of Elizabeth, wife of Jill (Vicky Krieps), has taken with it warmth itself. The unexpected suicide of her partner has left her a hollowed-out shell \u2013 that is, until Jack (Dacre Montgomery), Elizabeth\u2019s long-absent son, arrives at the funeral, apparently invited by Jill herself, though she does not remember doing so.\n\nThe circumstances of Jack\u2019s long absence are unclear \u2013 all that is known is that Jack was given up for adoption at a very young age. Staying the night at Jill and Elizabeth\u2019s oppressive, concrete-clad mountain abode, it quickly becomes clear that the spirit of Elizabeth has not yet departed \u2013 instead, she has gained the ability to possess both wife and son and is utilising this ability to linger and address the needs of either relationship. What initially seems to be a gift from beyond, however, begins to sour when long-hidden secrets of the past begin to emerge, and lines between the two begin to be crossed.\n\nThe sophomore feature of Samuel Van Grinsven, Went Up the Hill is a wintry, gothic affair, and a showcase for the untapped talents of Montgomery, who most will recognise as the golden-haired, ill-fated muscle mutt Billy from Stranger Things. Essentially a two-hander (with occasional, welcome interjection from Kiwi legend Sarah Peirse as Jack\u2019s frosty, mystery-shrouded aunt), Van Grinsven tracks the trajectory of these two adrift people and the spirit between them \u2013 from unexpected refuge, to joy, to dread \u2013 with a purposeful, drip-fed escalation of tension. Questions of control, abuse and the lingering weight of past scars take hold, all while the usually pleasantly scenic Christchurch landscape is transformed into a suffocatingly claustrophobic ice prison. Van Grinsven\u2019s muscular direction bears none of the flashy excesses of an emerging filmmaker \u2013 his vision emerges, stately, imposing and fully-formed. \u2014 Tom Augustine",

    "description": "Contact Improvisation with Eliza Sanders & Footnote Dance, Contact Improvisation with Eliza Sanders & Footnote Dance\nFive-Day Intensive Workshop with Eliza Sanders\n\nAbout this Event\n\nThis intensive week offers a rare opportunity to dive deep into the practical tools and nuanced territories of Contact Improvisation. Fresh from three weeks of intensive CI training in Thailand, Eliza returns with new wisdom and embodied understanding to share with our community.\n\nA Unique Learning Community\nThis workshop brings together an extraordinary learning environment where Footnote's four full-time dancers will practice alongside independent dancers and community participants, creating a rich exchange of distinct yet equally valuable body wisdoms. Together, we'll explore the multilayered practice of Contact Improvisation in its depth and complexity.\n\nThe Journey: Progressive Deepening Throughout the Week\nThrough structured explorations and guided improvisation, we'll delve into the physical practice while also discovering the connections between how we move together and how we navigate life with greater ease and joy. As is Eliza\u2019s style, we'll explore both the practical tools of the craft and uncover how this embodied practice offers insights for moving through the world with more presence and connection.\nWe'll venture into advanced techniques and principles of Contact Improvisation. Each day will build organically on the last, allowing for genuine integration and discovery. The specific focus will evolve from the insights and practices Eliza brings back from the Inspiral intensive in Thailand.\n\n\n\nWho This Workshop Is For\nThis intensive creates magic precisely because it brings together diverse perspectives and experience levels. We welcome:\nGraduates of Contact Improvisation foundations workshops ready to deepen their practice\nExperienced movers curious about the broader applications of CI principles\nProffesional dancers eager to nuance and expand their practice\nCommunity dancers eager to learn alongside professional practitioners\nAnyone interested in exploring movement as a pathway to more effective communication and compassionate action\nThose drawn to embodied practices for personal and social transformation\nPrior Contact Improvisation experience recommended but not essential\u2014our kaupapa embraces the wisdom that emerges when professional and community dancers share the learning space.\n\nPractical Details\nWhen: Monday - Friday, October 13-17, 2025 Time: 9am - 5pm daily Where: Footnote Dance Studios Capacity: Maximum 10 participants (alongside our 4 Footnote dancers) What to Bring: Comfortable clothes for dancing, long sleeves and socks recommended Included: Tea and snacks throughout each day (lunch not included)\n\nInvestment\nEarly Bird: $300 (until September 12th) Regular Price: $350\n\nAbout Your Facilitator\nEliza brings years of dedicated Contact Improvisation practice and teaching, known for creating environments where technical skill development and personal discovery flourish together. Her recent intensive training in Thailand with internationally renowned teachers adds fresh depth to her already rich understanding of CI as both movement practice and life practice. Former participants consistently highlight her ability to create space where everyone\u2014from newcomers to experienced dancers\u2014can access new layers of understanding and embodied wisdom.\n\nCome As You Are\nThe most profound discoveries in Contact Improvisation emerge from the unexpected\u2014from the intersection of different bodies, experiences, and ways of moving through the world. Your unique perspective and embodied wisdom are exactly what this learning community needs. Come ready to explore, to be surprised, and to discover how the dance floor becomes a training ground for creating the more compassionate, connected world we all long for.\nNo perfection required. Just openness to the movement.\n\n\n\n",

The streets after 2 a.m. and too many beers are alive with obstacles; cops are grumpy, goth girls are tempting, and the help of the Gods is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought.

Marion and Melanie are sure they\u2019ve committed the perfect murder by killing their friend Norman and hiding his body in a chest, a chest their select group of friends have been invited over to have a murder mystery games night around.

    "description": "Film screening: GAGA, Film screening: GAGA\nJoin us for a special screening of the 2022 Taiwanese comedy-drama film GAGA, featuring a Q&A with the award-winning Director, Laha Mebow\n\nAbout this Event\n\nGaga\u300a\u54c8\u52c7\u5bb6\u300b(2022)\nDirected by Laha Mebow 112 mins, Mandarin/Atayal/Taiwanese, English subtitles\nAmong the Atayal indigenous people of Taiwan, gaga is the traditional law and custom, the way of living with the land and organising society, the source of values. When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

And many are not even able to receive the same treatment options here in NZ.\nSquash has always been a sport of endurance, resilience, and determination. Playing for 24 hours is my way of honoring his fight, raising awareness, and bringing people together to support the cause.\nYou can help by:\nDonating: Any amount you would like to.\nPredicting: Predicting how many points and games will be played in 24 hours.\nJoining me on court: Book a slot to play a game, cheer from the sidelines, or come be part of the atmosphere.\nBuy raffle tickets, or sponsor a prize towards the raffle.\nWe would like to give a shout out to our current sponsors;\nHair Phoria,\nAimee Photography,\nX-Potential,\nMitchells,\nMeaters,\nCBD Eatery,\nForrest Wines and\nFat Tony's\nNo matter how small, your contribution will make a difference. Together we can transform his story of late diagnosis into one of community, awareness, and action.\nI\u2019ll be pushing myself through the night, but I won\u2019t be alone\u2014your support will keep me going with every serve, rally, and game.

One garden has previously featured in the House and Garden magazine. The tour (self-guided) will begin with lunch and an opportunity to buy potted plants in the tranquil St Alban's church garden, 11 Ngaio St Eastbourne, Lower Hutt, Wellington. The tour will end with hors d'oeuvre, wine and live music in the last garden.\nThis is a chance not just to visit amazing gardens but support the earthquake strengthening of St Alban's historic church and hall for a rejuvenated community hub.\nSt Albans church garden\nThe six private gardens all lie within a less than 100 m walk of the 83 Metlink Marine Parade bus route, but a car or bicycle would be more convenient.\nA glimpse of the six separate gardens (a-e).\na\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\nf\nThe garden show is in support of earthquake strengthening of the de Jersey Clere designed St Alban's church and adjacent hall to remake this a community hub.\nFor the last hundred years and more, this beautiful church designed by acclaimed architect Frederick de Jersey Clere has been the heart of Anglican parish life for people in the eastern bays of Wellington. People have rejoiced, prayed and wept in it through happy family milestones and sad occasions, through two world wars and countless celebrations and crises. Along with its parish hall and tranquil garden, it has been the base for social and community services and outreach, and its memorial wall houses the ashes of local residents.\nBut in 2016 the congregation had to suddenly leave the church, which was deemed an earthquake risk.\nSince then, the parish has explored alternatives for continuing its life and service to the people of the eastern bays. In that process it has kept its ministry and worship going through borrowed premises in local schools and other churches. Now, however, the parish has decided it needs to go back to its original base and strengthen both St Alban\u2019s Church and the parish hall so it can continue to serve the community from its heart and home in Ngaio Street, for the next hundred years and more.\nDetailed plans for strengthening the church and hall to meet acceptable safety standards have been drawn up, and fund-raising is under way. The parish is a registered charity (CC22188) and tax-deductible receipts will be issued for all donations.\nPostponement by 1 day to 30 Nov if weather were to dictate and would be announced on this web site.",

Off the back of a monstrous summer, which saw them play 19 shows up and down the country, the pair have spent most of 2025 in the studio finessing their own brand of audio alchemy and preparing to release their label, also named XCOMMUNICATE.\n\nUsually XCOMMUNICATE is a 6 hour journey though decades and sonic realms, however as Heylady is still recovering from a mighty dose of burnout they\u2019ve roped in a couple of their good friends, who happen to be some of Wellington\u2019s finest, to join them as they lay down four hours of four to the floor.\n\nHalo is a mainstay on Wellington dancefloors and it was a no brainer asking her to be on this lineup. A DJ since 2000, she has played festivals across the country and never fails to rock her slot. Her set at Taniwha\u2019s Den last summer was a big highlight and one of the best of the festival. Halo\u2019s ability to drive forward thinking sound and her clever construction of sets are just two reasons you need to be on her floor.\n\nDJ Coda is the godfather of techno in New Zealand. With a career that spans decades, he isn\u2019t just a DJ but a dedicated promoter and one of the trustees of NZ\u2019s longest running student radio station, Radio Active. Part of the COMMUNICATE family from the get go (and a longtime collaborator of Heylady\u2019s), DJ Coda is a master of his craft and never fails to deliver. Armed with knowledge , taste and a hefty love of Detroit, DJ Coda is the man when it comes to rocking the dance floor.\nFirst release tickets are on sale now, grab yours before they are gone and come and dance the evening away with four of the best. We recommend arrive early so you don\u2019t miss out on any of the sets, they are all going to be killer.\n\nIMPORTANT INFO:\nOur event is a safe space for all. If you or someone you know is feeling unsafe or harassed, please approach one of the DJs or bar staff. If you are behaving badly and impacting others ability to have a good time safely, you will be removed. Please act with respect and care for your fellow attendees at all times, no means no and this goes for conversations as well as more intimate requests.\n\n",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\n\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.\n\n",

Raised in Barcelona by her maternal grandparents, Marina visits her paternal family in Galicia, in order to obtain the paternity recognition documents that would allow her to apply for a scholarship. Guided on her journey by the pages of her mother's diary, Marina revisits her parents\u2019 story of love and addiction...\n\nSim\u00f3n brushes with delicate touches the dynamics of a difficult family reconciliation and the motions of post-adolescent desire (the attraction between Marina and her cousin). While she initially draws from the tropes of summertime family dramas, Sim\u00f3n then turns Romer\u00eda into a dreamlike fable where the past comes alive through the present thanks to the simple, yet enchanting true magic of cinema.\u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

    "description": "NZIFF: Sex, Returning from last year\u2019s Festival to screen alongside the rest of his Sex Dreams Love trilogy, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s comic drama takes a candid and refreshing look at modern gender roles.\n\nThere has hardly been any investigation on contemporary male identity and sexuality as candid, insightful and hilarious as Norwegian auteur Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Sex. After winning all major laurels in Nordic cinema with his impressive fresco Beware of Children (2019), the acclaimed director and author embarkson an Oslo-set trilogy simply called Sex Dreams Love.\n\nThe first instalment opens on one of the most tantalising and unexpected preludes in recent cinema. Two chimney sweeps frankly open up to each other on a coffee break in their office: the first reveals that he dreamt of being intensely looked at by none other than David Bowie, who was inspecting him as if he was a woman; the other confesses that he recently accepted the sexual advances of a male customer who asked him to have sex with him. But both men are \u201cstraight\u201d and married to women. Here, the deft tone of the film and Haugerud\u2019s rules of the game are immediately set.\n\nA fervent admirer of Eric Rohmer\u2019s thickly scripted skirmishes of love and ethics, the Norwegian writer-director infuses irony, depth and compassion in each of his elegantly composed tableaux depicting how the two men cope with the turmoil these experiences bring to their relationships with their partners and family, but most of all with themselves. Featuring some of the brightest and funniest dialogues of 2024, Sex is a real eye-opener. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor. This is despite his daughter being one of the pupils benefiting most from the free expression encouraged by Antonio\u2019s Freinet method teachings. Meanwhile, Ariadna teeters between hope and despair in her search for closure \u2013 a human vessel embodying the plight of a nation still wrestling with the consequences of a brutal conflict.\n\nThe closing credits remark that the remains of 12,000 people have been exhumed across the country. Like Ariadna, the film attempts to seek answers from the horrors of a war that took place almost a century ago \u2013 one driven by political sentiments that feel unsettlingly familiar as some of today\u2019s most powerful nations shift towards fascism. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

    "description": "NZIFF: Sentimental Value, This film may touch on the familiar theme of how artists draw from their own lives, but Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgard bring incredible tenderness to a story that is ultimately about what children and parents never say to one another \u2014 and whether those lifelong silences can ever be broken.\nCollaborating again with frequent co-writer Eskil Vogt (now also a successful director), Trier fashions a nuanced look at both a troubled family and a dysfunctional film industry. (Gustav\u2019s comeback project will be distributed through Netflix, and the divisive streamer is the target of a couple of the screenplay\u2019s better barbs.) Much of Sentimental Value takes place in the Borg family\u2019s home, and an efficient flashback, framed as an essay Nora wrote as a girl, explains how they have lived in the house for generations\u2026 That slightly fading family home becomes an apt metaphor for the weathered bond Nora, Agnes and Gustav share, although Reinsve\u2019s fragile performance articulates the festering resentment she feels toward her absent father.\nTrier\u2019s third picture to screen at Cannes, after 2021\u2019s The Worst Person In The World\u2019s breakout lead Reinsve won Best Actress, the reunion of director and star will entice arthouse crowds\u2026 and those seeking a smart, thoughtful tearjerker should be pleased with this sentimental but farfrom-mawkish film.\u201d \u2014 Tom Grierson, Screen Daily",

    "description": "NZIFF: The Teacher Who Promised the Sea, A progressive teacher brings new methods to a village in Burgos on the eve of the Spanish Civil War, whilst in present day Catalonia a woman searches for answers as to the whereabouts of her great-grandfather\u2019s remains.\n\nCatalan filmmaker Patricia Font takes us to 1930s Spain by way of real-life educator Antonio Benaiges, assigned to teach in the small village of Ba\u00f1uelos de Bureba. Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor. This is despite his daughter being one of the pupils benefiting most from the free expression encouraged by Antonio\u2019s Freinet method teachings. Meanwhile, Ariadna teeters between hope and despair in her search for closure \u2013 a human vessel embodying the plight of a nation still wrestling with the consequences of a brutal conflict.\n\nThe closing credits remark that the remains of 12,000 people have been exhumed across the country. Like Ariadna, the film attempts to seek answers from the horrors of a war that took place almost a century ago \u2013 one driven by political sentiments that feel unsettlingly familiar as some of today\u2019s most powerful nations shift towards fascism. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

Distance and death became everyday realities for Kiwis at home \u2013 and caused griefs that were at times taboo and suppressed.\n\nDame Gaylene Preston frames seven women, including her own mother, against a black background that creates a stage for their candid, unadorned and surprisingly intimate wartime recollections, as they look back from the 90s in interviews conducted by oral historian Judith Fyfe. The acclaimed documentary, which combines these shared testimonies with personal photographs and newsreel clips, conveys the immense pressure to conform to the value of stoic sacrifice for the cause under the scrutinising eye of neighbours, and reveals lesser-seen layers of resilience.\n\nMarriages in the first flush of romance were cut short, pregnancies were navigated alone, conscientious objectors were met with ostracisation and American servicemen scorned, in a nation united around support of their boys in combat overseas \u2013 a state of affairs in which women were often granted little voice, as they took on more labour, and absorbed life-changing losses. \u2014 Carmen Gray",

The inclusion of considerable footage from Jacinda's partner Clarke Gayford provides a deeply personal view of life as the Prime Minister in very challenging times.\n(Los Angeles Times review) 'Prime Minister' is not interested in wrangling, dealing and lawmaking, or even the nuts and bolts or her progressive views. .. But in the fleet, pacey manner of the editing, toggling between private and public moments with highlight-reel efficiency, the film is a stirring glimpse of top-down kindness as a winning leadership style.",

In the late 1800s, small numbers of Chinese settled in Samoa and became part of a growing multicultural community. There they influenced local customs, made an enduring contribution to Samoan cuisine introducing contemporary favourites such as sapasui (chop suey), keke pua\u2018a (pork buns) and of course laisa (rice). \r\n\r\nDragons celebrate this cultural and culinary fusion by showcasing these favourites and presenting new dishes highlighting the shared love of culinary staples such as taro and noodles, rice, fish, and pork, the magnificent spectrum of Chinese herbs, spices and flavours. Through cooking and sharing food together the chefs honour their culinary heritage, strengthen our connections to one another and celebrate the big and little moments in life. This is a shared-style meal, served banquet style on lazy Susan turntables. \r\nDragons is My Uso was one of the sell-out hits of the 2024 festival - don't miss out!\r\n\r\nDiscounted tables for 10 available for $1000, so get the whole aiga together!",

    "description": "Next Gen Cook Off, The Next Gen Cook Off returns for its fifth year, and things are heating up at Everybody Eats.\r\nEvery Monday in August, four of Wellington\u2019s freshest young chefs will go head-to-head in a high-energy kitchen takeover, serving up epic three-course dinners using rescued food.\r\n\r\nEach chef will be given the same protein, generously provided by Meat Direct, but everything else is a surprise\u2014ingredients are revealed that morning, based on what\u2019s come in. Menus are created on the spot, and dishes are served to a buzzing, hungry crowd. It\u2019s fast-paced, creative chaos with serious culinary skills on display. Guests get a front-row seat to the action, while supporting a truly game-changing enterprise.\r\n\r\n4 August \u2014 Jessie Gibberd, Loretta\r\nOriginally from rural Waikato, Jessie Gibberd made the move to Wellington to study, but it was the buzz of hospitality that captured her heart. Swapping textbooks for tongs, she left her degree behind to dive headfirst into the kitchen. Now a chef de partie at Loretta, Jessie brings a grounded, fresh perspective to one of the city\u2019s most beloved eateries.\r\n\r\n11 August \u2014 Felipe Molina, El Matador\r\nHailing from Chile, Felipe Molina is a professional chef with over 15 years of experience in kitchens around the world. Having worked in several countries and world-class restaurants, Felipe brings a global sensibility to his craft. With a passion for seafood, meats, and bold, expressive flavours, his cooking is shaped by travel and tradition, blending international influence with creativity on every plate.\r\n\r\n18 August \u2014 Zane Gupwell, Graze\r\nZane Gupwell began his hospitality journey at just 15, washing dishes at a local caf\u00e9 in Mount Eden. From there, he headed to Queenstown, learning from a wide range of chefs and kitchen styles before challenging himself with a move to Wellington. Since then, he\u2019s worked at some of the city\u2019s top restaurants and now brings his thoughtful, evolving style to Graze Wine Bar.\r\n\r\n25 August \u2014 Lulu Temmuyin, Mr Go\u2019s\r\nLulu Temmuyin is a chef who loves pushing boundaries, even when they\u2019re unexpected. Lactose intolerant but obsessed with cheese, and not a fan of lamb but winner of a lamb cooking competition, Lulu is all about surprises. At Mr Go\u2019s, she brings bold, sustainable flavour to the forefront, blending personality with punch in every dish.\r\n\r\nEverybody Eats runs on a pay-what-you-can model, transforming food waste into gourmet meals and bringing the community together over good kai. The Next Gen Cook Off celebrates and champions this mission, proving that rescued food can be next-level delicious.\r\n\r\nThe Next Gen Cook Off is proudly supported by The Gas Hub.",

The book will be launched by Charlotte MacDonald.\n\nTuesday 7 October, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nAll welcome!\n\n'Existing views of Featherston are fragmentary, negative and not very satisfactory. He was the \u201clittle Doctor\u201d, a single-minded despot wielding tyrannical power and casting an oppressive shadow. As I began to understand more of his life, I realised that there was little appreciation of a man who had contributed so much.\u2019 \u2014John E.Martin\n\nIsaac Featherston was at the heart of some of the most significant developments in New Zealand from the 1840s colonisation by the New Zealand Company to the abolition of the provinces in 1876. A doctor, newspaper editor and politician, he advocated for the provinces against the domination of central government, while also being primarily responsible for the relocation of the capital from Auckland to Wellington in 1865.\n\nKnown amongst M\u0101ori as \u2018Petatone\u2019 and with a reputation for directness and honesty, he was at the very centre of P\u0101keh\u0101\u2013M\u0101ori relations, and in his 1857 official portrait is depicted alongside leading rangatira Te Puni and Wi Tako.\n\nAbout the author: Dr. John E. Martin has researched and written about New Zealand history since the 1980s, teaching in universities and employed as a historian in the public sector. He was parliamentary historian in the 2000s and 2010s. His publications include rural and labour history, the history of science and engineering, and social and political history. His books include The Forgotten Worker (1990), People, Politics and Power Stations (1991 and 1998), Holding the Balance (1996), The House: New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives, 1854\u20132004 (2004), Parliament\u2019s Library (2008), Honouring the Contract (2010), Illuminating Our World (2017), A Colonist\u2019s Gaze (2018) and most recently Empire City: Wellington Becomes the Capital of New Zealand (2022).",

    "description": "Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days, Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days\nThis workshop is ideal for advanced students who have already learned how to set cabochon stones. Over two three-hour sessions, 20 and 27 September, 10am-1pm, you will be given an understanding of the technique of setting faceted stones using a setting burr, hammers, punches and burnishing tools. This is the first step in learning to flush set facet cut stones so they sit below the surface of the metal.\n\nSession 1 will cover the technique, demonstrations and the basics of preparing and cutting the setting. Students will be shown how to set their stones, and may begin to do this in class, but will then go on to repeat and practice the technique in their own time.\nThey can do this at home, or for a small extra cost, can stay on at the studio to practice setting for the afternoon.\n\nSession 2 will pick up on the setting techniques, reminding and refining essential steps in the process. Troubleshooting can be covered in this class, as well as learning to clean up the settings. The principles of this setting technique will be covered in a few different scenarios, as some students may wish to take this skill into different styles or directions.\n\nThe option for students to have a half-day bench hire after class will also apply to this session.\n\nWhat is provided: class fees cover your practice metal (copper) and stones (CZ) and detailed handouts that are useful for you to take away to refer to when practising and honing your skills.\n\nCorrectly sized drills and setting burrs will be provided in class, but students must purchase their own burrs for practice after class and any future bench hires. These are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nWhat to bring: Advanced students can bring projects to set stones into, but please note the metal must be at least 2mm thick and we do not allow brass to be used as a project or practice for beginners. The metal must be copper or sterling silver.\n\nStudents should bring either a craft magnifier or magnifying lenses/glasses. If you have your own flex shaft tool you plan to use at home for drilling and setting, please also bring this along so that your tutor can advise on the best way to use it. We have two drilling machines in the studio, and these must be shared between the students, so if you have a machine, do bring it.\n\nPractice bench hire after class $20 per person (till 4pm) must be booked in advance.\n\nWorkshop fee $195, Early bird $175 till 24 August.\n\n",

It is a world that, despite its historical setting, feels unnervingly close to our own.\nWith only ten dynamic performers, this is Henry the Fifth like never before: stripped back, sharp, and driven by the raw intensity of Shakespeare\u2019s text.\nExpect fast-paced storytelling, immersive staging, and a production that puts the audience at the heart of the battle.\nFull show duration: 95 min including a 15 min intermission.\n\u201cThis production epitomises what can be achieved when talent, teamwork, hard work, opportunity and passion combine.\u2019\u201d\nNZ Herald on The Tragedy of Macbeth ",

    "description": "Mystery 35mm Movie Marathon, Details\nUPDATE - We have added some Half Marathon ticket options for those can't make the whole event. You can either select 'Daytime' or 'Evening' which will let you watch three features total. Daytime tickets are from 1:30pm until the dinner break (around 7:00pm). Evening are from the dinner break until the end of the last film.\n\nSurprise we are running a 35mm Mystery Marathon very soon! We have had some exciting news that we cannot share for now but as a result we must move our beautiful 35mm from its usual location into storage for a bit. We are not sure when it will be set back up so to celebrate we are running a marathon of six 35mm features across one Saturday!\n\nWe will kick off the first film at 1:30pm sharp on Saturday and will have a short dinner break after the third film. All going to plan we should be done by around 12:30am.\n\nIn terms of the features, we have films from the 1960s through to the early 2000s with a mix of comedies, sci-fi, horror and cult classics! Granted not all of these films would be considered masterpieces but there is nothing more fun than sitting in a crowd not knowing what could be coming next!\n\nWe will have a snack menu you can pre-order before the first film so aim to arrive around 1:00pm to order. The breaks between films will be very short (probably just enough time for the projectionist to thread up the next film) so make sure you come prepared for back-to-back screenings.\n\nThis event has strictly no digital projection, it\u2019s all film all the time. Now in theory it should all playback without a hitch as we are bringing in some of the best projectionist\u2019s Wellington has. But 35mm is a strange beast that can sometimes throw up the odd issue.\n\nFull marathon tickets (Admit) are $50\nHalf Marathon - Daytime are $30\nHalf Marathon - Evening are $30\n\nSeating is general admission and cinema entrance will be determined by earliest ticket purchase times.",

    "description": "Treasury Guest Lecture with Michael Keen: IN-PERSON attendance, Join us for our special Fiscal Policy for the Future seminar\nNew Zealand faces significant long-term fiscal challenges, including the rising costs associated with an ageing population, increasing demand for public services, and the need to adapt to a changing global economy. These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand. The Trust was established to support leading tax policy thinking in New Zealand. You can read about the Trust\u2019s work here.\nAbout the presenter\nMichael (Mick) Keen is a former Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, where for over twenty years he played a central role in shaping and delivering IMF policies and advice on tax matters.\nHe has advised finance ministries in all parts of the world, including missions to over forty countries, and led the preparation of influential papers for the G20 and the Executive Board of the IMF.\nBefore joining the Fund, Mick was Professor of Economics at the universities of Essex (UK), Queens (Canada) and Kyoto, and is now Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo.\nMick was the keynote speaker at the 2014 conference on the Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand and has provided peer review for Inland Revenue\u2019s previous Long-Term Insights Briefing.\nMick has jointly authored, with Joel Slemrod, Rebellion, Rascals and Revenue \u2013 an entertaining account of how history illuminates the perennial challenges and timeless principles of taxation\u2014and how the past holds clues to solving the tax problems of today.\nAbout this seminar series\nNew ideas, innovative concepts, research evidence and expert advice are all crucial to stimulate and inform the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis and advice. Our current theme for guest lectures - Fiscal Policy for the Future - explores the role of stabilising, sustainable and effective fiscal policy. Speakers provide insights into how fiscal policy can be designed to support government to meet its current and future objectives and obligations while adapting to changing circumstances and delivering value to the New Zealand public.\nFiscal policy has a stabilising role in helping to smooth the business cycle, while sustainability in fiscal policy is foundational for resilience to both shocks and longstanding challenges, such as climate change, technological advancements, and demographic trends. Ensuring effective and value for money expenditure is important so that fiscal policy contributes to the living standards of New Zealanders, both now and in the future.\nPlease note that the views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series are those of the individual presenters. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the New Zealand Treasury or the New Zealand Government.\nFor updates and our latest research visit: www.treasury.govt.nz\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to be the first to hear about our upcoming events in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series, please SUBSCRIBE to stay up to date.",

The catch is, you have to pair it with a salsa that you make yourself. There are no limits on the style of cocktail you want this time around, so get creative!\nIf you would like to participate, get in touch with me or Dan ASAp as we were running low on time to organize this time around.\nMinimum 30ml of Tequila must be used in the drink and as always must be the hero spirit of the night.\nYou will be making two drinks for the judges to try and 5 minutes to make two servings of your cocktail and serve your salsa.\nThe judges may also be coerced with bribes and favours during your presentation.\nThe event will be on 28th of September and the competition will start at 6pm.\nIf you have any questions about the competition, please ask either me or Dan.\nThe main aim of this cocktail competition is to help those who may not have entered comps before, gain a bit of confidence and experience, or for people who haven\u2019t entered a comp in a while, to shake off those cobwebs.\nIt also a chance to meet new people and introduce newcomers to the Wellington bar scene.

Glassware and ice will be provided, you are more than welcome to bring specialty equipment and ingredients, however you will be marked on how easy your drink is to replicate.\nThe competition will be judged by a panel of 3 judges. While knowing your stuff is important, brand knowledge is not the key here.

There\u2019s no pressure or expectation, just the freedom to explore what feels right for you:\n\nA dynamic, connected breath for those who wish to build energy, move emotion, or break through internal blockages\n\nA slow, rhythmic breath for those seeking stillness, calm, and deeper grounding\n\nBoth approaches invite a sense of spaciousness \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally \u2014 while supporting nervous system balance and inner clarity.\n\nTo gently close the session, we\u2019ll move into a quiet, nurturing meditation to support integration and leave you feeling steady, clear, and connected.\n\nAfterwards, stay and enjoy a nourishing plant-based dinner and dessert, lovingly prepared to complement the experience \u2014 because healing is also about how we feed and care for ourselves.\n\nWhy Breathwork?\n\nBreathwork has helped so many shift from a state of tension and overwhelm into a place of ease, clarity, and resilience \u2014 often after just one session. It\u2019s a simple, powerful practice that reconnects you to your body, your breath, and your inner stillness.\n\nYou\u2019ll leave feeling more grounded, more present, and more like yourself again.\n\nMeet Karla, your host\nKarla is a breathwork and trauma-somatic facilitator based in Aotearoa (New Zealand), originally from Malta.

This 4-session block course teaches teens how to use drawing to process hard feelings and access their own inner resources, which can be used at home as visual journaling.\nDates\nThis block course consists of 4 workshops:\n4.15pm-5.30pm\nTuesday 19th August - Metaphors for feelings\nTuesday 26th August - Uncovering needs\nTuesday 2nd September - Unlocking self-compassion\nMonday 8th September - Curiosity in direction\nCost\n$184 total ($46 per session)\nIncluded in each session\nYou will be guided by Lara Phillips, a trained creative facilitator in Interactive Drawing Therapy, through drawing prompts (similar to a guided meditation or journaling) to draw out where you are at and draw out your own inner guidance. No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz\n\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing. It is not intended as therapy nor does it replace counselling, therapy, or any other medical or clinical professional help. Participants are guided to draw out where they are at, whilst drawing out their own inner resources for support and guidance.\nParticipants understand it is their own responsibility to manage their mental and physical health during sessions, to opt in and out of activities as they see fit, and make the facilitator aware if further support is required.",

Dress up is not compulsory but it does add to the immersive experience. No acting is required as the cast members of the show are the suspects, and guests get multiple opportunities throughout the evening to interact with the suspects to work out which one of them is the Murderer.\n\nThere is a reason this is NZ's longest running comedy show, so get ready to laugh in the face of Murder, as this show is a side splitting comedy with some guests even complaining that their \u201cface hurt from laughing so much\u201d. Others have said... \u201cHaven\u2019t laughed that much in ages, thanks guys and girls\u201d and \u201cThanks team for such a great night!! We came last night and that\u2019s the best fun I have ever had\u201d.\n\nGet a group of friends together, grab your costumes and book now for the latest sensation in live entertainment. But beware! There are many distractions along the way to keep you from solving this dastardly deed!\n\n",

A large part of the book is devoted to Southeast Asia\u2019s responses to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

    "description": "Make Some Noise - choral music that matters, After a successful performance of Mozart\u2019s classic Requiem in D Minor in May, Supertonic is back with a programme of contemporary choral music that matters. \nOn the evening of Saturday 8 November, Supertonic will present Make Some Noise at the Lower Hutt Town Hall. This is the first time the choir has performed in the Hutt Valley, and they hope to see some new faces in the audience as they bring this programme of  meaningful music from around the world to the stage.  \nMake Some Noise highlights issues of social justice, including indigenous, women\u2019s and civil rights and climate action. The programme is rich and varied, from Katerina Gimon\u2019s arrangement of AURORA\u2019s Apple Tree, a Norwegian pop song addressing the urgency of the global climate crisis, to Robert T. Gibson\u2019s arrangement of the gospel standard This Little Light of Mine. Oliassa by Malika Tirolien utilises an invented language to invoke a call from the ancestors, while Alex Vollant titles their piece Auass meaning \u201cchild\u201d in the Innu language to honour the generation of elders who survived the Residential Schools in Canada. The impact of sexual harassment and assault on women is highlighted in MILCK\u2019s I Can\u2019t Keep Quiet  and Lillia Ruocco and Emmanuelle Ader\u2019s Canzone r\u00f2 curtiell\u2019. Closer to home, Make Some Noise features a set of waiata in teo reo M\u0101ori to highlight the importance of indigenous voices in Aotearoa New Zealand, including Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s Whakarongo. This waiata-\u0101-ringa incorporates Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s beliefs and methodology on teaching te reo M\u0101ori.   \nLed by co-Musical Director Virginie Pacheco, Supertonic offers Make Some Noise as an invitation to concert-goers to consider the causes that are important to them. In connecting with audiences through the striking and impactful works of the composers featured in this programme - by turns harmonious, raucous, gut-wrenching, resolute - the choir hopes to inspire those listening to make some noise in their own lives. \nSupertonic was formed in 2014 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and strives to  push the boundaries of what choral music can be. The choir has performed concerts that cover the entire musical spectrum, from major classical works including Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Vivaldi's Gloria and Faure's Requiem to pop and rock spectaculars celebrating hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s from the likes of Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Elton John, Queen, and Celine Dion. The choir has performed alongside The Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, joined Brett McKenzie, the NZSO and The Muppets for the Jim Henson Retrospectacle,  shared the stage with Mama Kin Spender at Coastella, and performed in national civic commemorations, street festivals and at community events.",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods. Her works have appeared in the Politics, International Politics, Political Science, PS: Political Science & Politics, Journal of Contemporary China, Pacific Review, and Asian Security.\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 04:30 PM - 05:30 PM\nWelcome reception with refreshments and light catering\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 06:30 PM\nKeynote address: Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal Intern\nHost: Christina Lai\n\n\n",

It makes time for meeting our various challenges, while learning and growing us into better friends, partners, dads, sons and humans. \nIt isn\u2019t a boys or bros club, therapy or a self-help seminar, religious or new-age. No fixing, preaching, or pressure. It\u2019s not a crisis service or a substitute for professional care. The sign-up form explains this in more detail.\nYou can expect to:\nPractice listening and learn communication skills for life\nDiscover greater integrity and self-accountability\nBe supported in building your emotional intelligence\nBecome a part of a hearty and diverse community\nHave a good time - it\u2019s often uplifting and inspiring.\nJoseph and your team of hosts have all been in regular men's groups for many years. The group sometimes offers simple and proven inquiries that draw on NVC, MBSR, active listening, gratitude and more.",

    "description": "Book Group: The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran, Do you keep meaning to read more of the great classics of literature? At Wellington Classic Literature Group we read novels that have stood the test of time, whether they were written in 1780, 1880 or even 1980. The group has been running for more than a decade and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers that come along for particular books or simply when it suits. We meet on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nOur November book, and first work of poetry, is Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet (1923). Born in Lebanon in 1883 and later emigrating to the United States, Kahlil Gibran bridged East and West. His writings, poetry and art explore themes of love, spirituality and humanity.\n\nThe Prophet, his classic work of prose poetry, has been translated into more than 100 languages and is one of the best-selling books of all time. It has never gone out of print.\n\nProject Gutenberg link for those e-reading:\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/58585\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place.

    "description": "Men's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection, Men's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\nMen\u2019s Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\n\nIn a world where men are often expected to have everything figured out, this gathering offers a space to be genuine, not perfect.\n\nThis is a free event, with an optional plant-based dinner available for $15. While there\u2019s no obligation to stay for dinner, sharing a meal together offers a meaningful way to strengthen connections. Andre and Sri Jiva co-host this circle with a shared passion for creating authentic, supportive spaces where men can connect deeply\u2014offering this gathering simply because they believe in its importance.\n\nThe Men\u2019s Circle provides a safe and nurturing environment where men can share openly, express their feelings, and encourage personal growth\u2014free from societal pressures to be stoic or self-reliant. Through honest sharing and collective support, participants build resilience, deepen self-awareness, and strengthen their sense of identity and purpose.\n\nStructure of the Circle\n\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.\n\nA short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\n\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center. Only the person holding the object may speak, ensuring uninterrupted sharing.\n\nOpen Sharing: Anyone may choose to share while holding the object. Sharing is optional, and passing is always respected.\n\nActive Listening: While one person shares, others listen attentively without speaking, interrupting, or offering advice. The focus is on witnessing and being present.\n\nNo Judgments or Advice: Participants refrain from judging or offering unsolicited advice, creating a safe space for authentic expression.\n\nClosing: The circle may conclude with a group reflection, a moment of gratitude, or a simple acknowledgment of the shared experience.\n\nCircle Agreements\n\nSupportive Environment: We are here to uplift and support one another, fostering trust and brotherhood.\n\nFocus on the Present: Share what's alive for you now, focusing on your emotions and experiences to deepen emotional awareness.\n\nUse \"I\" Statements: Speak from your personal perspective using \"I\" statements to promote authenticity and responsibility. Avoid generalizations like \"we\" or \"us.\"\n\nNo Judgment or fixing: Refrain from judging others sharing or offering unsolicited advice, ensuring a safe and non-critical space.\n\nConfidentiality: What is shared in the circle stays in the circle. You may discuss your own experience outside the group, but keep others' details private.\n\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\n\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\n\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n................................................................................................\n\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

His work explores the intersection of art and science, using photography to reveal the unseen and challenge conventional notions of landscape. Over the past seven years, his research has focused on developing a site-specific and responsive approach to photographic interventions within the landscape.\nDrawing inspiration from scientific 'fieldwork,' Kay\u2019s practice involves close observation and data collection, using these methods to uncover new insights into specific environments. However, his approach extends beyond the typical scientific framework by leveraging the unique possibilities of the photographic medium. This process enables him to move beyond the traditional, idealized representation of landscapes, offering deeper, more complex interpretations.\nSeptember 25, Tararua Tramping Club (4 Moncrieff St, Mt Victoria), Doors Open at 7pm\nIf you\u2019re curious about the Wellington Photographic Society, you\u2019re welcome to attend two meetings for free before deciding whether to join.

Through open sharing and mutual support, participants are empowered to build resilience, self-reflection, and a stronger sense of identity and purpose.\nStructure of the Circle\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.A short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center.

That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 05:45 PM\nArrive to Bhakti Lounge\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:45 PM - 07:15 PM\nMen's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\nHost: Andre\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:15 PM - 08:15 PM\nPlant-based dinner and dessert!\n\n\n",

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nMercy Lie:\n\nDriving all night under the stars, along the highways of human experience, the original songs of Mercy Lie will haunt, surprise, remind and affirm.\n\nMercy Lie is the musical guise of Laura Chester-Murphy. An instinctive sound maker from an early age, Laura just wants to keep the music rolling. There\u2019s a lot of sound from that little acoustic guitar and a voice to match. In the songs, you will find fierce independence, crushing vulnerability and a reflective wit that speaks to a life of figuring stuff out along the way.\n\nWith influences ranging across and not limited to folk, funk, country, goth, indie and 90\u2019s rave, Laura puts the focus on crafting percussive earworms that won\u2019t leave your head easily. The music of Mercy Lie is a unique soundscape, sculpted with ambience and depth, the silence unforgettably painted by explorations into the motivations of both the self and fellow travellers.\n\nMercy Lie is about connecting over the foibles of polite society and the ways we are wired to weave around each other.\n\nHometowns, journeys, mysteries, ghosts, growing up, messing up, speaking out, moving on. If you like getting nostalgic over something and nothing all at once, buckle up.\n\n\u201cMercy Lie\u2019s novel approach to the guitar and talent for songwriting make for the perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that voice to come from that mouth.\u201d\n\u201cAn acoustic delight!\u201d\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience. As she continues to evolve as an artist, Araiyah\u2019s music promises to touch the hearts of many, leaving a lasting impact on all who have the privilege of listening.\n\nAraiyah will be accompanied by guitarist Izzy and Laura Chester-Murphy on percussion.\n\nRain and the Urban Bohemians:\n\nFormed around the music of singer-songwriter Cathy Elizabeth aka Rain, supported by her band of Urban Bohemians, this group has been able to weave together many different influences and styles to create something quite unique and beautiful.\n\nPeppered with contemplations of our existence and the fleetingness of time, Rain & the UBs bring the magic with a folk-rock edge and an alluring authenticity at its centre. Spiritual undertones and overtones give way to an uplifting joyfulness, of triumph over difficulties and life lessons learned and expressed through music.\n\nWith Cathy Elizabeth on vocals & acoustic guitar, Chris Ewers on bass, Murray James on drums and Izzy and Dion on guitars, these guys have got the goods and are ready to deliver!\n\nSo come along and allow yourself to be immersed and transported, moved and entertained. It\u2019s going to be a very special night all round!\n\n",

Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages. In fact, the staff consultation is, in itself, is a wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops.

When triggered, these unconscious \u201cprograms\u201d hijack our reactions, leaving us feeling stuck even when we want to move forward. In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore how trauma influences the nervous system and why awareness alone isn\u2019t enough to create lasting change.\nIn this 75 minute workshop, you\u2019ll discover how trauma impacts the nervous system and learn FasterEFT tools to release triggers, reframe old memories, and reset your stress response.

It\u2019s a powerful reminder that, beneath the surface, we generally share the same challenges and struggles\u2014and that healing becomes easier when we explore them together.\u201d\nMeet your host, Krishnaloka\nIntroducing Krishnaloka, who is driven to help others overcome their issues within their mind and pyschology. As a mind technician trained in eutaptics (Faster EFT), she employs the fastest and most powerful method to create lasting change by addressing the root causes of issues rather than just the symptoms. Her warm and caring nature makes every interaction with her both comforting and transformative.\n\n\n6.15pm Tuesday 7th of October\nEnd the session on a high note with a delicious plant-based dinner, dessert, and good conversation.\nTickets available here~ bit.ly/eventTickets\nBhakti Lounge 1/175 Vivian Street, Te Aro, Wellington. http://www.bhaktilounge.org.nz ",

    "description": "Jazz in Martinborough 2025, Big Band Brings Back the Swing\nJazz in Martinborough 2025\n\nJazz in Martinborough is thrilled to be bringing you the Royal New Zealand Airforce Jazz Orchestra as our feature act on Saturday at the festival for 2025.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be able to fill the stage with a full-sized big band of fabulous musicians, and the Town Hall with the fantastic sounds of the big band era,\u201d says Jazz in Martinborough Music Director Lee Quayle.\n\nJazz in Martinborough is back for their 13th edition during the first weekend in September with ticketed shows on Friday 5th and Saturday 6th and other gigs around town as usual. \u201cThe RNZAF Jazz Orchestra will be one of our ticketed gigs, featuring on the Saturday evening,\u201d says Lee. \u201cAnd on Friday night we invite you to Be Transported back in time to a speak easy club with the superb swing and blues combo that is April\u2019s Fools,\u201d adds Lee.\n\nStaying true to the tradition of swing and improvisation the RNZAF Jazz Orchestra draws on their own rich history dating back to the original \u2018swing era\u2019. The Orchestra is a national trailblazer in big band history and features New Zealand compositions, and a classic repertoire from the golden era of big band swing jazz of Ellington and Basie.\n\nThe band benefits from a depth of talent that most military bands around the world would only dream of and is made up of Wellington\u2019s most exceptional musicians.\n\n\u201cThe line-up will be a who\u2019s who of the Wellington jazz scene,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s a while since we had a big band at the festival, so we\u2019re elated to have the Airforce Jazz Orchestra back with us again. They last played at the festival in 2014. Many of the band members have been here since, but not as part of a big band,\u201d says Lee.\n\nBe Transported by April\u2019s Fools\nImagine stepping back in time to a speak easy club. A smoky, dimly lit room where the anticipation is electric but the vibe is laid-back and relaxed. . .\n\nFrom the stage a jazz swing and blues band begins to play, their instruments blending seamlessly in a harmonious symphony of sound. The rhythm section, with its upright bass and snare drums, lays down a groove that's impossible to resist, while the saxophone punctuates the air with soulful notes.\n\nAt. the forefront stands a captivating female singer, her voice rich and velvety, weaving tales of heartache, joy, and everything in between. Her vocal prowess brings both swing and blues to life, effortlessly moving from sultry, slow blues ballads to energetic, foot-tapping swing numbers.\n\nThis band doesn't just play music; they create an experience that transports the audience to another era, where the essence of jazz and blues reigns supreme.\n\nWelcome to an evening of superb swing jazz and blues brought to you by the band that is April\u2019s Fools. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely wrapt to be bringing this ultra-talented and experienced combo to the festival,\u201d says Music Director Lee Quayle. \u201cWhenever, and wherever this group of musicians have played reviewers have to search the thesaurus for new superlatives to describe the show, and audiences leave reluctantly, but happy.\u201d\n\nApril\u2019s Fools are April Phillips (vocals), Greg Crayford (drums), Zak Dikvert (guitar), Nicholas Bauke-Maunsell (saxophone), Miles Crayford (keyboards) and RoryMacartney (bass). They will be playing at Jazz in Martinborough on Friday 5 September 2025 as the opening of the ticketed festival gigs to be held in the Town Hall.",

You can either select 'Daytime' or 'Evening' which will let you watch three features total. Daytime tickets are from 1:30pm until the dinner break (around 7:00pm). Evening are from the dinner break until the end of the last film.\n\nSurprise we are running a 35mm Mystery Marathon very soon! We have had some exciting news that we cannot share for now but as a result we must move our beautiful 35mm from its usual location into storage for a bit. We are not sure when it will be set back up so to celebrate we are running a marathon of six 35mm features across one Saturday!\n\nWe will kick off the first film at 1:30pm sharp on Saturday and will have a short dinner break after the third film. All going to plan we should be done by around 12:30am.\n\nIn terms of the features, we have films from the 1960s through to the early 2000s with a mix of comedies, sci-fi, horror and cult classics! Granted not all of these films would be considered masterpieces but there is nothing more fun than sitting in a crowd not knowing what could be coming next!\n\nWe will have a snack menu you can pre-order before the first film so aim to arrive around 1:00pm to order. The breaks between films will be very short (probably just enough time for the projectionist to thread up the next film) so make sure you come prepared for back-to-back screenings.\n\nThis event has strictly no digital projection, it\u2019s all film all the time. Now in theory it should all playback without a hitch as we are bringing in some of the best projectionist\u2019s Wellington has. But 35mm is a strange beast that can sometimes throw up the odd issue.\n\nFull marathon tickets (Admit) are $50\nHalf Marathon - Daytime are $30\nHalf Marathon - Evening are $30\n\nSeating is general admission and cinema entrance will be determined by earliest ticket purchase times.",

It\u2019s also just a different & cool way of meeting new people by getting a bit out of your comfort zone and skipping the small talk!\nJoin us for games, talks, and connections with friends you haven\u2019t met yet. Join if you get annoyed after being asked what you do, where you are from, and how long you have been in Wellington every single time you meet someone. If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll never have to speak in public if you don\u2019t want to!\n\nHOW TO JOIN?\nTake 2 minutes to fill out our form\n\nhttps://luma.com/ftstwellington7\nOur events are limited to 30 handpicked guests to ensure a cozy atmosphere. We prioritize a balance in gender and cultural diversity, making each gathering a unique blend of perspectives! If you're invited you'll receive an invite with a special link via our ticketing platform Luma\n\nHOW MUCH IS IT?\nThe cost to attend is NZD 23 (early llama) - NZD 25 (general llama) and includes the following:\n3 hours of facilitated and curated activities\nLight snacks to keep the energy going (only if outdoors)\nA space to meet new people in the least boring way possible\nSupporting our mission to slowly eliminate small talk around the world\nAlso includes those pesky ticket fees!\n\nWHERE IS IT?\nWe host our events in awesome cafes, rooftops, and bars across the city. We only reveal the location to ticket holders 24 hours before the event.\n\nWHAT THEY SAY\n\u201cGreat way to connect with people in a more meaningful way. Get to the heart of the matter, dive straight into what really counts!\u201d - Matthias\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of activity humanity needs every weekend. Thank you for all.\u201d - Sonya\n\n\u201cF*ck the Small Talk changes the narrative from \"Where are you from?\" to \"When was the last time you laughed uncontrollably?\" and I think that's beautiful.\u201d - Monika\n\n\u201cI loved F*ck the small talk, I was a little bit nervous at first but they are pros at making you feel comfortable with the rest of the group, the activities are really fun and I enjoyed every second (consider that the one who's saying this is very, very shy). Give it a try!\u201d - Brenda\n\n\"it\u2019s a wonderful experience, it\u2019s like being a kid again, when you were at the park, playing with other kids, and just decided you were going to be best friends for the next hours. Maybe you\u2019ll never see those kids again. But that hour was amazing because you both opened up and trusted each other.\" - Sara\n\n\u201cLively, interesting, introspective, completely open and no judgement. Everyone that joined was ready for great conversation and helped with different perspectives. So much fun!

Why?\nWe usually get a high volume of sign-ups yet we like to keep it cozy & only about 30 people. We believe this is a good number to ensure an awesome experience! Please try again next time if do not receive an invite - no hard feelings\n\n\u2022 Why do you charge?\nWe value our time and put a lot of love, planning, and effort into creating & designing these experiences.\nThis is our project/business and what we give to the world and we think everything should be a fair exchange! However, money should never be the reason for people not to attend. If you can\u2019t afford it simply get in touch with us\n\n\u2022 I'm digging this! Can I get involved somehow?\nSure thing, send us a message!\n\n\u2022 Can I bring my cute dog/llama?\nIt depends on where the event is! Message us to make sure.

With biting wit, Chloe lays bare the heartbreak of rejection from the world she adores, and turns that pain into power. This is a story of survival, self-discovery, and the ultimate comeback: becoming the best version of yourself when the system says you don\u2019t belong.

The script is backed by evidence and forms parts of Charlizza Matehe\u2019s doctoral research on rangatahi suicide and mental health. It pays tribute to our very first suicide prevention show, Smoke & Mirrors, which toured Aotearoa in 2015 and ignited a kaupapa that has stood the test of time, while suitable for wh\u0101nau audience, parental guidance is advised due to sensitive themes around suicide and grief. This show was created to open honest, hopeful conversations around mental health and to remind our young people they are not alone. We warmly encourage people working with youth, youth groups and community r\u014dp\u016b to attend together. Email for more information and group bookings\n\n",

When triggered, these unconscious \u201cprograms\u201d hijack our reactions, leaving us feeling stuck even when we want to move forward. In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore how trauma influences the nervous system and why awareness alone isn\u2019t enough to create lasting change.\nIn this 75 minute workshop, you\u2019ll discover how trauma impacts the nervous system and learn FasterEFT tools to release triggers, reframe old memories, and reset your stress response. You\u2019ll walk away with simple, science-backed practices you can use every day to build resilience and emotional freedom.\n\u201cThis is an interactive workshop where you\u2019ll connect with others. It\u2019s a powerful reminder that, beneath the surface, we generally share the same challenges and struggles\u2014and that healing becomes easier when we explore them together.\u201d\nMeet your host, Krishnaloka\nIntroducing Krishnaloka, who is driven to help others overcome their issues within their mind and pyschology.

These encounters shift into a clandestine relationship that Istv\u00e1n himself can barely understand, and his life soon spirals out of control.\nAs the years pass, he is carried gradually upwards on the twenty-first century\u2019s tides of money and power, moving from the army to the company of London\u2019s super-rich, with his own competing impulses for love, intimacy, status and wealth winning him unimaginable riches, until they threaten to undo him completely.\nSpare and penetrating, Flesh is the finest novel yet by a master of realism, asking profound questions about what drives a life: what makes it worth living, and what breaks it.\n\nMelissa and Eden will be hosting our monthly book club to discuss some of the excellent recently released books.\n\nIn September we will be discussing Flesh by David Szalay.\n\nWe have limited tickets available so grab a ticket sooner rather then later and tell your friends and wh\u0101nau.\n\nDrinks and snacks provided.

Return could therefore either be 1:30 or 2:30 with the latest return to Titahi Bay being 3pm.\n\nWe've made this event later than the normal SKISL so that it's easier for folks to drive down from Palmerston North, and also because it is a lunch event.\n\nThe lawn on Mana is really nice, sheltered and pleasant and there are also good walks. Mana is of course a sanctuary so you must check your boats for any wildlife especially ants that may have gotten in past the hatches. Also we cannot have any fires\n\nPlan B: If weather nukes Mana, we'll try for Green Point or Onehunga Bay in Whitireia Park by driving there.\n\nPlan C: We will postpone to 21 December\n\n",

Brush up on your Tequila knowledge and your Salsa recipes because the next Wellington Cocktail Competition is just around the corner!\nAs to the theme for this WCC, it is \u201cTequila and Salsa food pairing\u201d The hero spirit this time around will be a surprise tequila on the night, but I can tell you it will be a reposado. The catch is, you have to pair it with a salsa that you make yourself. There are no limits on the style of cocktail you want this time around, so get creative!\nIf you would like to participate, get in touch with me or Dan ASAp as we were running low on time to organize this time around.\nMinimum 30ml of Tequila must be used in the drink and as always must be the hero spirit of the night.\nYou will be making two drinks for the judges to try and 5 minutes to make two servings of your cocktail and serve your salsa.\nThe judges may also be coerced with bribes and favours during your presentation.\nThe event will be on 28th of September and the competition will start at 6pm.\nIf you have any questions about the competition, please ask either me or Dan.\nThe main aim of this cocktail competition is to help those who may not have entered comps before, gain a bit of confidence and experience, or for people who haven\u2019t entered a comp in a while, to shake off those cobwebs.\nIt also a chance to meet new people and introduce newcomers to the Wellington bar scene. Most of all the idea is to have fun!\nEach competitor will have 5 minutes to make and present two servings of their drink.\nAll Tequila and corn chips for your salsa will be provided, but you will have to source your own ingredients including citrus and sugar syrup. Glassware and ice will be provided, you are more than welcome to bring specialty equipment and ingredients, however you will be marked on how easy your drink is to replicate.\nThe competition will be judged by a panel of 3 judges. While knowing your stuff is important, brand knowledge is not the key here. This comp is to engage bartenders in a fun comp environment, so drink and personality are just as important.\nCompetitors will be first come first serve, so message either me or Dan if you want to be entered, there are 10 spots for the night and there will be prizes for the winner.\nThere will be drink deals on the night, and make sure you bring your friends, workmates, parents ect ect to cheer you on and heckle the other competitors\u2026\nSee you all there!

Most props are provided but feel free to bring your own yoga mat for extra comfort as well as a cushion, blanket, socks and an eye pillow if you have one.\n\nThis class is suitable for all - no previous experience is required.\n\nLIMITED SPACES AVAILABLE.\nTWILIGHT SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/5a2pad44\nMORNING SESSION - https://tinyurl.com/mw82z38u\n\nRestorative yoga is a practice of deep relaxation in which yoga poses (asanas) are held for several minutes with the use of props such as blocks, bolster and blankets to support the body in gentle stretch.\n\nWhen your body enters a state of relaxation, your mind will also relax. Once you have been guided to let go of any tension held in your body, all that is required is for you to pay attention to your breath, becoming aware of any thoughts that may arise, and then gently releasing them.\n\nThis restful practice calms both mind and body, allowing the nervous system to enter its parasympathetic state \u2013 the state of \u201crest and digest\u201d, in which healing is enabled and enhanced.\n\nAbout Cacao\nCacao is a superfood. It is plant medicine at its finest. Its scientific name, Theobroma cacao, translates to \"food of the Gods.\" Containing many minerals, vitamins and phytonutrients such as flavonoids and antioxidants, it is also an extremely potent adaptogen that encourages the body to come into balance.\n\nCacao has a particularly strong influence on the heart \u2013 both physiologically and energetically. Cacao anecdotally is reported to enhance connection in community, hence its beauty in being shared in circle.\n\nIn Jenny's experience, cacao seems to enhance whatever it is that you are doing \u2013 be it running a marathon or meditating \u2013 cacao can make you go deeper, further, longer, stronger. However she does seem to have a mind of her own so be open to the experience she offers you \u2013 it may not always go quite how you planned!\n\nCacao is very safe and tolerated well by most people. However it is to be used with caution by people who are taking high doses of SSRIs. Cacao releases serotonin, so it works as a mild antidepressant. When taken with SSRIs that release serotonin chemically it can lead to serotonin syndrome. Individuals taking MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should avoid consuming ceremonial cacao due to potential interactions.\n\nThis workshop is part of Pukerua Bay Hub's 2025 Pop-up Parlour - thanks for your support.\n\n____________________________________\nWHAT IS THE POP-UP PARLOUR?\nA chance to create and connect in our pop-up community space. From 1-30 September we've got a jam-packed schedule with 65+ events for kids, families, rangatahi and adults to learn, hang out and have fun.\n\nCheck out all the free/koha events too -\nhttps://www.pkbhub.org.nz/whatson\n\nWaiho i te toipoto, kaua i te toi roa \u2013\nLet us keep close together, not far apart.\n\n",

You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

Once you register, you'll receive an acknowledgement from Humanitix, followed by a second email directly from the Holocaust Centre of New Zealand.\n2025 Annual Kristallnacht Commemorative Concert\nEscape & Exile \u2013 East & West\nJoin the Holocaust Centre of New Zealand for a poignant evening of remembrance and reflection. The Te K\u014dk\u012b Trio, featuring Inbal Megiddo (cello), Martin Riseley (violin), and Jian Liu (piano), will be joined by Professor Kim Cunio, Head of Te K\u014dk\u012b / New Zealand School of Music, in a powerful performance commemorating Kristallnacht.\n This concert commemorates Kristallnacht, or \u201cThe Night of Broken Glass,\u201d the horrific pogroms of 9\u201310 November 1938, across Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland. This state-sponsored violence saw the murder of an estimated 91 Jews, the arrest of 30,000, and the destruction of hundreds of synagogues and Jewish businesses. Kristallnacht is widely regarded as a pivotal moment, marking the escalation of Nazi persecution and often described as the beginning of the Holocaust.\n The Nazis sought to silence the music and art of all those they deemed \"untermenschen,\" including six million Jews and other victimised groups. This concert stands as a powerful act of defiance and remembrance, allowing us to hear the voices of those who were murdered, forced into hiding, or exiled. It celebrates their artistic brilliance and ensures their memory lives on.\n This year's theme is \"Escape and Exile: East and West.\" In the tradition of paying musical tribute to all victims, we will honour the music of Jewish composers from across the globe\u2014from the Netherlands and Nazi-occupied Germany in the West, all the way to Iraq and Shanghai in the East.\n The programme will feature pieces that honour:\nErna Weiss Falk, a talented Jewish opera singer from Cologne, whose promising career was cut short by anti-Jewish laws. She and her family ultimately escaped to the Netherlands.\nBrigitte Schiffer, a young composer who completed her doctorate in Berlin before fleeing the Nazis to Egypt, where she became the director of the Higher Music Education Institute for women.\nThe Al Kuwaiti brothers, Jewish pioneers of modern Iraqi music, survived the Farhud, a devastating pogrom inspired by Nazi ideology that targeted Baghdad's Jewish population on June 1-2, 1941, coinciding with the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. Despite their legacy resonating across the Middle East through radio, their contributions were erased from Iraqi history.\nFerdinand Adler, a Hungarian Jewish violinist who miraculously escaped from the Dachau concentration camp, to Shanghai.\n Join us for this important event as we mourn the lives lost and celebrate the resilience of the human spirit. We look forward to welcoming you.\n Details:\nWellington: Sunday, 9 November 2025\nAuckland: Monday, 10 November 2025\nDoors Open: 6:00 PM\nConcert Begins: 6:45 PM\nLocation: To Be Announced\n Please RSVP by Monday, 3 November 2025, to let us know if you can join us.",

This series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\nEach of the evenings will bring a different electronic vibe, conjured by some of Wellington\u2019s most innovative artists. The series lineup includes:\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\nTickets are available from Wednesday 18 June, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\nAbout the Artists\nLudus\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\nStephen Gallagher\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\nDavid Long\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\nJules Desmond\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\nOghum\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\nJess Chambers\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration.

I was busy trying to love and please everyone else that I completely lost myself.\n\nDuring my first class something shifted. The music \u2014 the movements \u2014 Reminded me of that spark within me. It felt like my soul finally had permission to shine again. For that one hour, I could breathe. No pressure, no expectations, no noise from the world or my mind. Just movement, music, and freedom to be me.\n\nI believe fitness should be intentional, empowering and fun.\n\nCome give it a go!\n\n",

From cutting his teeth as the drummer and songwriter for Kyuss\u2019s legendary early albums to carrying the torch for fuzz-driven rock with Fu Manchu from 1994 to 2001, Bjork\u2019s impact is undeniable. Over the past two decades, he has produced albums for other artists, launched numerous side projects, built an extensive solo career as a singer, guitarist, and bandleader, and founded his own record label. His story is one of relentless, boundary-pushing creativity.\n\nIn 2024, Bjork re-formed the Brant Bjork Trio, teaming up with Michael Amster (Nebula, Mondo Generator) on drums and longtime friend\u2014and desert rock pioneer\u2014Mario Lalli on bass.\n\nIn 2025, the trio heads to New Zealand for three exclusive shows celebrating their latest album, Once Upon a Time in the Desert. This is a rare chance to catch a true icon of desert rock live\u2014an experience not to be missed.\n\nJoining them on all three dates are Australian rockers Full Tone Generator. Born on the beaches of Australia by Andy Fernando and brought to life in the Californian desert, Full Tone Generator brings the heat with a powerful blend of riff-heavy rock and raw energy.",

The album drops 19 September on streaming & vinyl.\n\nNever overblown or overproduced, Dreams That Feel Like Falling is direct and intimate. 11 tracks of warmth, sincerity and brashness that strike a balance of breeze and overdrive.\n\nTo celebrate the release, Cowboy Dan are heading out for a run of shows throughout Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui in September and October.\n\nThis Te Whanganui-a-Tara will be the second outing in the capital for Cowboy Dan, who are delighted to bring Echo Children along for the ride from T\u0101maki to share their special tunes and infectous harmoines, along with Te Whanganui-a-Tara local legends Search For Yeti...STACKED!\n\nOnce aptly described as The Bats on the right amount of Red Bull, Cowboy Dan has been treating audiences across the motu to energetic, emotionally charged tunes since 2015. Their live shows have consistently delivered good times to fans and new friends alike.\n\nOff the back of two delightful EPs: We Will Hesitate, When We Eventually Wait (2017, Mixed by Jonathan Pearce); Sentimental Now That We're Leaving (2021, Mixed by Rohan Evans), the debut LP, Dreams That Feel Like Falling, is a continuation and a few steps forward, showcasing the bands expansive sonic pallet, with a mix of distortion, introspection, heart and bite.\n\nSearch For Yeti draws from a deep range of influences to create a sound that achieves the difficult feat of being hugely atmospheric and diverse while also being hook laden. This is an act that captures people with their onstage energy \u2014 and gets them talking afterwards about the songs that they just heard.\n\nFollowing in the long tradition of innovative Aotearoa indie bands, Echo Children craft a distinctive sound by melding psychedelic pop harmonies with sharp alt-country songwriting.\n\nGather your pals and get ready for good times! A thursday, sure, but what a chance to digest some upbeat goodness hailing from the big smoke and with some local goodness to boot.\n\n",

    "description": "Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour, Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour\nIndie-Folk Artist Colette Rivers and her band will be performing her intimate new album, The Backyard Wonder.\n\nIndependent artist Colette Rivers is releasing her second full-length album, The Backyard Wonder, an intimate exploration of healing, change, and the quiet beauty of ordinary moments.\n\nThis album holds special meaning for Rivers: after being diagnosed with cancer in July 2023, her planned sophomore release had to take a back seat to recovery. But when the cancer returned in early 2025, she felt compelled to finish and release the album, not just as a legacy project, also as a celebration after hard times, with a focus on how \u201cyou can find the wonder in life, even in your backyard.\u201d\n\nA lifelong creative, Rivers records, mixes, and produces in her home studio in Masterton, and plays every instrument heard on The Backyard Wonder. Her debut album, Memory Lake (2020), was shaped by early years spent in the US, and her move to Taup\u014d at age 11; this was followed by a nationwide tour. Now based in the Wairarapa and working as a secondary school drama teacher, Rivers continues to move between solo performance and full band sets, while staying rooted in the acoustic traditions that define her sound.\n\nWith her right arm partially paralysed following recent treatment, Rivers has gathered a group of close friends to help bring the songs of The Backyard Wonder to life (especially its intricate fingerpicking parts) for a run of live shows. She\u2019ll be touring the Wellington and Wairarapa regions from August through October, finishing with a set at the Wellington Folk Festival.\n\nFor updates, and behind-the-scenes glimpses, visit www.coletteriversmusic.com or follow @colettemusic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nOpening for Rivers are artists:\n\nPhil Masters\nPhil Lively-Masters is an experienced, well travelled singer songwriter who specialises in writing the sort of Sun Kissed West Coast Laurel Canyon Americana that made Neil Young, Stephen Stills and the Byrds famous. With a powerful, honey soaked voice that has won praise and support slots from legendary American country rock pioneers like The Jayhawks and original cosmic cowboy Steve Young, Phil has 20 years worth of road worn original songs to pull on, including tracks from the critically acclaimed CANYON RYDE album 'Free To Be' and some choice country rock covers to weave a spell on any listener.\n\nSaali Marks\nA singer, songwriter, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, Saali Marks hails originally from the\nSouth Island, but has made Wairarapa his home for the last 20 years, where he lives on a farm\nwith his family and teaches music at Kuranui College.\nSaali has played in numerous bands over the years, in a wide range of styles from proto-punk\nto psychedelic dub, covers, originals and fully improvised music with no discernible genre, on\nstages throughout Aotearoa since 1991. Currently he fronts the Wellington ska band Battleska\nGalactica.\nThroughout and alongside it all Saali has indulged his love for songwriting and solo\nperforming, developing a unique style, rooted in folk and blues, and inspired by greats from\nacross the decades. A skilled guitarist, Saali rarely plays straight ahead chords, and an\neducation in jazz has informed his ear for harmony, the beauty of dissonance, tension and\nresolution, with unconventional song structures, alternate tunings and intriguing melodies.\nAlthough not adverse to penning the odd love song, most of Saali\u2019s lyrics tend to focus on\nother aspects of the human condition, from religion and politics to our relationships with the\nenvironment and our own minds.\n\n",

    "description": "Folk B*tch Trio - Wellington, Folk Bitch Trio - 'Now Would Be A Good Time' Album Tour with special guest Georgia Knight\n\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories. Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology",

    "description": "Make Some Noise - choral music that matters, After a successful performance of Mozart\u2019s classic Requiem in D Minor in May, Supertonic is back with a programme of contemporary choral music that matters. \nOn the evening of Saturday 8 November, Supertonic will present Make Some Noise at the Lower Hutt Town Hall. This is the first time the choir has performed in the Hutt Valley, and they hope to see some new faces in the audience as they bring this programme of  meaningful music from around the world to the stage.  \nMake Some Noise highlights issues of social justice, including indigenous, women\u2019s and civil rights and climate action. The programme is rich and varied, from Katerina Gimon\u2019s arrangement of AURORA\u2019s Apple Tree, a Norwegian pop song addressing the urgency of the global climate crisis, to Robert T. Gibson\u2019s arrangement of the gospel standard This Little Light of Mine. Oliassa by Malika Tirolien utilises an invented language to invoke a call from the ancestors, while Alex Vollant titles their piece Auass meaning \u201cchild\u201d in the Innu language to honour the generation of elders who survived the Residential Schools in Canada. The impact of sexual harassment and assault on women is highlighted in MILCK\u2019s I Can\u2019t Keep Quiet  and Lillia Ruocco and Emmanuelle Ader\u2019s Canzone r\u00f2 curtiell\u2019. Closer to home, Make Some Noise features a set of waiata in teo reo M\u0101ori to highlight the importance of indigenous voices in Aotearoa New Zealand, including Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s Whakarongo. This waiata-\u0101-ringa incorporates Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s beliefs and methodology on teaching te reo M\u0101ori.   \nLed by co-Musical Director Virginie Pacheco, Supertonic offers Make Some Noise as an invitation to concert-goers to consider the causes that are important to them. In connecting with audiences through the striking and impactful works of the composers featured in this programme - by turns harmonious, raucous, gut-wrenching, resolute - the choir hopes to inspire those listening to make some noise in their own lives. \nSupertonic was formed in 2014 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and strives to  push the boundaries of what choral music can be. The choir has performed concerts that cover the entire musical spectrum, from major classical works including Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Vivaldi's Gloria and Faure's Requiem to pop and rock spectaculars celebrating hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s from the likes of Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Elton John, Queen, and Celine Dion. The choir has performed alongside The Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, joined Brett McKenzie, the NZSO and The Muppets for the Jim Henson Retrospectacle,  shared the stage with Mama Kin Spender at Coastella, and performed in national civic commemorations, street festivals and at community events.",

The group is now actively\nworking towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\nRomi Wrights\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring\nstories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke\nfestival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release\nmid to late 2025.\n\n",

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nMercy Lie:\n\nDriving all night under the stars, along the highways of human experience, the original songs of Mercy Lie will haunt, surprise, remind and affirm.\n\nMercy Lie is the musical guise of Laura Chester-Murphy. An instinctive sound maker from an early age, Laura just wants to keep the music rolling. There\u2019s a lot of sound from that little acoustic guitar and a voice to match. In the songs, you will find fierce independence, crushing vulnerability and a reflective wit that speaks to a life of figuring stuff out along the way.\n\nWith influences ranging across and not limited to folk, funk, country, goth, indie and 90\u2019s rave, Laura puts the focus on crafting percussive earworms that won\u2019t leave your head easily. The music of Mercy Lie is a unique soundscape, sculpted with ambience and depth, the silence unforgettably painted by explorations into the motivations of both the self and fellow travellers.\n\nMercy Lie is about connecting over the foibles of polite society and the ways we are wired to weave around each other.\n\nHometowns, journeys, mysteries, ghosts, growing up, messing up, speaking out, moving on. If you like getting nostalgic over something and nothing all at once, buckle up.\n\n\u201cMercy Lie\u2019s novel approach to the guitar and talent for songwriting make for the perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that voice to come from that mouth.\u201d\n\u201cAn acoustic delight!\u201d\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience. As she continues to evolve as an artist, Araiyah\u2019s music promises to touch the hearts of many, leaving a lasting impact on all who have the privilege of listening.\n\nAraiyah will be accompanied by guitarist Izzy and Laura Chester-Murphy on percussion.\n\nRain and the Urban Bohemians:\n\nFormed around the music of singer-songwriter Cathy Elizabeth aka Rain, supported by her band of Urban Bohemians, this group has been able to weave together many different influences and styles to create something quite unique and beautiful.\n\nPeppered with contemplations of our existence and the fleetingness of time, Rain & the UBs bring the magic with a folk-rock edge and an alluring authenticity at its centre. Spiritual undertones and overtones give way to an uplifting joyfulness, of triumph over difficulties and life lessons learned and expressed through music.\n\nWith Cathy Elizabeth on vocals & acoustic guitar, Chris Ewers on bass, Murray James on drums and Izzy and Dion on guitars, these guys have got the goods and are ready to deliver!\n\nSo come along and allow yourself to be immersed and transported, moved and entertained. It\u2019s going to be a very special night all round!\n\n",

With a deep adoration for Pacific musical reference points and a desire to explore new sonic ground, LEAO synthesises non-traditional tonalities with a fa\u2018asamoa spirit, creating what some have called \u201cniu wave\u201d and \u201cPacific neo-psychedelia.\u201d A creative enigma and phenomenal live act since the release of their critically acclaimed debut GHOST ROADS in 2019, LEAO has continued to expand its vision with the 2024 single TAEAO / MEA UMA - a sparkling glimpse into a significant body of alternative Pacific music currently in development. The group is now actively working towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\n\nRomi Wrights\n\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring stories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke festival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release mid to late 2025.",

This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\n",

The Magnificat is a world favourite, arguably Bach's best choral piece that has transcended the ages, celebrating Luke's description of Mary's pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, the choir and orchestra perform Ritchie's Then I Understood. When a child of seven to nine, Laura Rangers sketched eight poems centred on summers at Otaki Beach, Ritchie seized the opportunity to add the musical dimension and the result are dual choirs - the Renaissance Singers split - accompanied by the Sinfonia to set off Rangers' delightful insights, so elegantly displayed. The magic that can be childhood.\n\nThe concert has a celebratory theme, it being the 50th anniversary of the choir. Thus the inclusion of Forrest's Three Nocturnes that express the wonderment involved when examining the heavens and the universe full of stars. Throughout this piece the percussionists alone from the Sinfonia provide whimsical accompaniment with a celeste providing the heavenly tones - a hit when played on the last occasion the choir sang the piece.\n\nOpening the concert will be Carl Orff's O Fortuna from his popular Carmina Burana. While O Fortuna laments the role of fate it is set in the larger piece that celebrates life with gusto.\n\nWith the performers in great form (two choristers just back from singing with the world's best choir) this concert will no doubt build the sense of celebration - full of life and wonderment.\n\nGeneral Admission $25, Concession $20, Secondary School $15,\nUnder 13 Free.\n\n",

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nMercy Lie:\n\nDriving all night under the stars, along the highways of human experience, the original songs of Mercy Lie will haunt, surprise, remind and affirm.\n\nMercy Lie is the musical guise of Laura Chester-Murphy. An instinctive sound maker from an early age, Laura just wants to keep the music rolling. There\u2019s a lot of sound from that little acoustic guitar and a voice to match. In the songs, you will find fierce independence, crushing vulnerability and a reflective wit that speaks to a life of figuring stuff out along the way.\n\nWith influences ranging across and not limited to folk, funk, country, goth, indie and 90\u2019s rave, Laura puts the focus on crafting percussive earworms that won\u2019t leave your head easily. The music of Mercy Lie is a unique soundscape, sculpted with ambience and depth, the silence unforgettably painted by explorations into the motivations of both the self and fellow travellers.\n\nMercy Lie is about connecting over the foibles of polite society and the ways we are wired to weave around each other.\n\nHometowns, journeys, mysteries, ghosts, growing up, messing up, speaking out, moving on. If you like getting nostalgic over something and nothing all at once, buckle up.\n\n\u201cMercy Lie\u2019s novel approach to the guitar and talent for songwriting make for the perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that voice to come from that mouth.\u201d\n\u201cAn acoustic delight!\u201d\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience. As she continues to evolve as an artist, Araiyah\u2019s music promises to touch the hearts of many, leaving a lasting impact on all who have the privilege of listening.\n\nAraiyah will be accompanied by guitarist Izzy and Laura Chester-Murphy on percussion.\n\nRain and the Urban Bohemians:\n\nFormed around the music of singer-songwriter Cathy Elizabeth aka Rain, supported by her band of Urban Bohemians, this group has been able to weave together many different influences and styles to create something quite unique and beautiful.\n\nPeppered with contemplations of our existence and the fleetingness of time, Rain & the UBs bring the magic with a folk-rock edge and an alluring authenticity at its centre. Spiritual undertones and overtones give way to an uplifting joyfulness, of triumph over difficulties and life lessons learned and expressed through music.\n\nWith Cathy Elizabeth on vocals & acoustic guitar, Chris Ewers on bass, Murray James on drums and Izzy and Dion on guitars, these guys have got the goods and are ready to deliver!\n\nSo come along and allow yourself to be immersed and transported, moved and entertained. It\u2019s going to be a very special night all round!\n\n",

Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

    "description": "Slow Grind Fever [AUS] - Wellington Jazz Festival, Express from Melbourne, Australia and crossing international waters for the first time this October, Meow is excited to welcome the slowest, spookiest, smokiest and swingin-est club night Wellington has ever seen: 'Slow Grind Fever'.\nFor this one-night-only episode of SGF Wellington, founder Richie1250 (106.7 PBS FM) will be joined by fellow Melbourne radio alumnus Dr. Popalotacorn (RRR, 98.1FM Raglan) and Wellington's own belle of the airwaves Miss Juliet (RadioActive.FM Americana)\nSlow Grind Fever was born in 2012 when Richie1250 hired a Russian Cultural Centre ballroom and threw a slow dance party for his 30th birthday, and it's been running as a regular monthly club night ever since. Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

    "description": "Techno Taster, Techno Taster\nThis year for the first of our annual pre-parties we\u2019ve gone around the country to gather a lineup of creators working at the intersections of techno, delving into influences from bass, breaks, psychedelia, club music and beyond, all underpinned by elements of dance music's most enduring genre.\n\nWe believe each one of these acts is currently pushing the needle forward for underground club culture in Aotearoa, and are thrilled to host them all together at Valhalla to push their vision across the almighty Third Eye Hi-Fi soundsystem.\n\n\nELI H\u00d8FF \u2014 Abyssal Soundworks / PHTM\n\nProducer and DJ, Eli is undoubtedly at the forefront of Aotearoa\u2019s underground dance scene.\nThose who have kept their ears tuned to the innovative underground have no doubt stumbled upon the tribalistic, psychedelic, and focused sounds emanating from the mind of Auckland-based producer Eli H\u00f8ff. With a string of releases on Berlin-based PHTM, T\u0101maki Makaurau-based Gypnotica, and an impressive catalog of self-releases, he consistently showcases his singular and original interpretation of dance music.\n\nInstagram.com/e.li\nelihoff.bandcamp.com\nabyssalsoundworks.bandcamp.com\n\n\nHUNTER \u2014 Hang the Saints / Haven\n\nRaised in Kaik\u014dura, Aotearoa, Hunter's dark and atmospheric sound often contrasts the beautiful environment she grew up in. Her direct approach to techno draws influence from heavy percussion, bold rhythm and industrial soundscapes. After spending two years finding inspiration in clubs overseas, she has returned to \u014ctautahi with a refined style that\u2019s ready to make people dance. As the co-founder of \u201cHang The Saints\u201d and resident of \u201cHaven\u201d, Hunter is all about creating safe, inclusive spaces for people to connect through the music she loves.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sspoonsnake/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hunter-mccrory-334790608\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/bC3qeA6pUxBoMo7P9\n\n\nLUDUS & RIZZO \u2014 Tonic Collective\n\nTonic Collective is the recent endeavour of Ludus and Rizzo, inspired by the people, places and spaces of their experience touring China with BIRDPARTY and Vera Ellen. Both acts are individually known for their versatile and innovative sound, bringing a wide range of influences and inspirations to the dancefloor. In the short time since establishing the collective, they\u2019ve already hosted Kaishandao and Bone Chapel, established a space, and debuted a monthly radio show on Mouthfull that explores sound from across the genre spectrum, both in the club and out.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ludus.etc/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alicerizzoofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tonic.collective/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/l-s-rizzo/416life-support-cl1n1c-chengdu\nhttps://soundcloud.com/racquetclub-info/mix-series-016-ludus\n\n\nSHLI \u2014 Echo Train Records / Warehouse Rave / Holding Hands\n\nShli is the alias of \u014ctautahi-via-P\u014dneke DJ and Producer Tim Ward. Steadily releasing works over recent years through local labels like Echo Train and the Big Fresh Collective, he is carving out a sound of his own.\n\nStitching together infectious rhythms layered over low-end pressure, Shli\u2019s sets draw influence from across the hardcore continuum and beyond. Creating dancefloor moments from trippy rhythmic states to unleashing sheer bass weight.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/____shli/\nhttps://echotrainer.bandcamp.com/album/ech009-bracing-set-pace-u-dont\nhttps://soundcloud.com/1shli\n\n",

The original rhythm section of David Wm Sims and Mac McNeilly further continue to prove why they were and are the best bass & drum combo since Jones and Bonham, anchoring the ship as Captain Yow and first mate Denison navigate the wild seas of their songs. And while he may not always feature (as he rightly should) on many modern music journalists \u2018best guitarists lists\u2019, Duane Denison could perhaps be the most innovative and idiosyncratic punk rock guitarist EVER.

The book will be launched by Charlotte MacDonald.\n\nTuesday 7 October, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nAll welcome!\n\n'Existing views of Featherston are fragmentary, negative and not very satisfactory. He was the \u201clittle Doctor\u201d, a single-minded despot wielding tyrannical power and casting an oppressive shadow. As I began to understand more of his life, I realised that there was little appreciation of a man who had contributed so much.\u2019 \u2014John E.Martin\n\nIsaac Featherston was at the heart of some of the most significant developments in New Zealand from the 1840s colonisation by the New Zealand Company to the abolition of the provinces in 1876. A doctor, newspaper editor and politician, he advocated for the provinces against the domination of central government, while also being primarily responsible for the relocation of the capital from Auckland to Wellington in 1865.\n\nKnown amongst M\u0101ori as \u2018Petatone\u2019 and with a reputation for directness and honesty, he was at the very centre of P\u0101keh\u0101\u2013M\u0101ori relations, and in his 1857 official portrait is depicted alongside leading rangatira Te Puni and Wi Tako.\n\nAbout the author: Dr. John E. Martin has researched and written about New Zealand history since the 1980s, teaching in universities and employed as a historian in the public sector. He was parliamentary historian in the 2000s and 2010s. His publications include rural and labour history, the history of science and engineering, and social and political history. His books include The Forgotten Worker (1990), People, Politics and Power Stations (1991 and 1998), Holding the Balance (1996), The House: New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives, 1854\u20132004 (2004), Parliament\u2019s Library (2008), Honouring the Contract (2010), Illuminating Our World (2017), A Colonist\u2019s Gaze (2018) and most recently Empire City: Wellington Becomes the Capital of New Zealand (2022).",

This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\nhttps://www.undertheradar.co.nz/tour/30764/Nui-Hui-7.utr\n\n",

The Aeronaut is currently still a work in progress; this evening offers keen punters a chance to watch Vorn and his frighteningly good band (Nick Brown - Drums; Charley Davenport - Bass, Thomas Liggett - Violin) iron out the final kinks on a future Kiwi classic.

His experience spans both the unreached world and the urban Western context, giving him a unique perspective that speaks powerfully into the New Zealand setting.\nWhy Attend?\nRyan\u2019s message directly addresses two urgent needs in New Zealand today:\nReaching our lost communities with the good news of Jesus.\nRevitalizing overseas missions sending, which has significantly declined in recent years.\nIf you long to see disciples and churches multiply\u2014both here and to the ends of the earth\u2014this workshop is for you.",

    "description": "Beginner's Weekend - Afternoon session, A fabulous and fun introduction to jewellery making over two afternoons, this is our most popular short workshop! Give yourself a gift of a new creative hobby (or maybe even a career?) this spring!\n\nThe students start with basic ring making in copper or brass. We begin with ring making as this process teaches students many fundamental techniques in one project, measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting, soldering and finishing are all included in this one ring.\n\nStudents will learn how to measure their fingers to get an accurately sized ring, later they will also learn how to take sizing from existing rings. They are shown how to use a jeweller\u2019s saw to cut their metal to the correct length, how to form it up and how to solder.\n\nThen they learn how to shape their rings and finish them up into a wearable piece of jewellery, all in the first class!\n\nIn the first session they are also shown how to texture metals, cut and layer shapes, melt balls of silver and other techniques to create decorative elements.\n\nStudents can spend their evening thinking about and planning their design in silver for the next day. We encourage them to carefully plan this project and think about how they might make their piece before they begin, including creating drawings and notes. (We always say drawings don\u2019t need to be \u201cgood\u201d, they just need to make sense to the student and their tutor!). This project can be another ring, or earrings or pendants. We have a great selection of example pieces in the workshop so they can see what\u2019s achievable in the 3-hour time frame. Sometimes students can make more than one silver piece if they have enough time.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are copper and brass for practising on, up to 8 grams of sterling silver and all consumables such as sandpaper, solder and chemicals. Extra metals and chains are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nKids 12 and up are welcome in this class, any person under 16 years old must be accompanied by an enrolled caregiver.",

They are sonic explorations that feature didgeridoos, drums, flutes, voice and orchestral elements. A collection of foraged sounds from objects he has recorded in nature, add even more textures. Many of his sounds are completely unrecognisable and abstract. Immersed in this cocoon of abstract sound, we can find ourselves in the most surprising places in our mind. In this timeless realm, beyond the normal limitations of rational reality, anything is possible.\n\nAn epic adventure deep inside yourself.\n\nJourney to worlds within worlds on incredible sound waves.\n\nSika creates a safe space to relax deeply and connect with our inner guidance. This Sound Journey begins and ends with a short guided visualisation.\n\nThere will be two journeys with an interval. Most people choose to lie down, so once again, please bring a yoga mat, pillow and blanket to get really comfortable.\n\nA journal is also recommended.",

Maitreya, the World Teacher, and his group The Masters of Wisdom are here - not as religious teachers - to inspire all people to create a civilisation based on sharing, justice and peace; and for humanity to act to do the work to share and save our world.\n\nHumanity at spiritual crossroads\n\nHumanity is at crossroads. One path into the future leads to increasing social and economic division, environmental destruction, war and planetary peril. The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\n\nMaitreya\u2019s priorities\n\nTo help humanity in its task of global transformation, Maitreya has formulated certain priorities. They cover the essential needs of all people, every woman, man and child: an adequate supply of food\u037e housing for all; healthcare and education as basic universal rights. Other top priorities include the restoration of the environment and the establishment of peace.\n\nThe key to achieving these goals requires a major shift of present mind-set and thinking, structures and systems \u2013 and more equitable sharing of the world\u2019s food and resources. To realise humanity is one global family and the planet is a living being. According to Maitreya: \u201cWithout sharing, there can be no justice; without justice, there can be no peace; without peace, there can be no future.\u201d\n\n~ followed by short Transmission Meditation session ~\n\nShare International New Zealand.

The tent is lovely during the day, but as it gets dark, it takes on a magical feeling. Fairy lights and crystals lit by gently changing coloured lights. We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle. Arniya then dances the energy in with Celestial Energy Movement, for the group. This creates a vortex of Divine power into the middle of the tent. Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\n",

The tent is lovely during the day, but as it gets dark, it takes on a magical feeling. Fairy lights and crystals lit by gently changing coloured lights. We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle. Arniya then dances the energy in with Celestial Energy Movement, for the group. This creates a vortex of Divine power into the middle of the tent. Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\n",

His productions are jagged and abstract, built from negative space, ambient haze and rhythms that never quite resolve. There\u2019s hip hop in the DNA, but it never plays by the rules, always veering towards something stranger, softer, rawer.\n\nThrough his label PLZ Make It Ruins, Vegyn has built an entire world. His 2019 debut Only Diamonds Cut Diamonds felt like a manifesto; the 71-track Text While Driving If You Want To Meet God! followed as a chaotic, genre-agnostic statement of intent. Since then, he\u2019s ventured further leftfield, releasing The Head Hurts but the Heart Knows the Truth under the alias Headache, followed by the 2024 masterpiece The Road to Hell Is Paved with Good Intention, and the unexpected arrival of Blue Moon Safari - an output that feels made more for himself than for any audience. Dreamlike, disjointed and deeply personal.\n\nAs a DJ, Vegyn shifts between industrial breaks, ambient drift and warped club memories. This October, he returns to Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Wellington and Auckland - a rare chance to slip through the cracks and step inside his world.\n\n",

It is a world that, despite its historical setting, feels unnervingly close to our own.\nWith only ten dynamic performers, this is Henry the Fifth like never before: stripped back, sharp, and driven by the raw intensity of Shakespeare\u2019s text.\nExpect fast-paced storytelling, immersive staging, and a production that puts the audience at the heart of the battle.\nFull show duration: 95 min including a 15 min intermission.\n\u201cThis production epitomises what can be achieved when talent, teamwork, hard work, opportunity and passion combine.\u2019\u201d\nNZ Herald on The Tragedy of Macbeth ",

The course takes in all the sights - Te Papa, Whairepo Lagoon and the Well_ngton sign - as it follows the wide public esplanade around the harbour. Views forever and usually (always) a decent wind to chase you to the finish line.\nAfter you finish your 5k - running or walking a flat, two-lap course around the waterfront - grab a banana and water or sport drink before heading back to your tent to see how your mates did. The best performances of the day - plus our amazing team managers - are acknowledged at the Awards Cermony at 7:30pm. Spot prizes wrap up around 8pm and there's time to exchange war stories as you pack down. ",

    "description": "Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2, Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2\nThe Second coming of the \"Crush the Vernon\" Vert Day is just around the corner, We had such a great time last time and its smack bang into the point where everyone needs elevation for events so i thought it would be silly not to bring it back!\n\n\"Crush the Vernon\" is a couple of fun endurance challeges to get us up into the Wither Hills for a big vert day!\nThis event will push you to the red line, boasting both as much high-level uphill suffering as you can possibly endure whilst building a steady accumulation of regret over 6 hours on the trails.\nIt\u2019s an event that's built to stretch the boundaries of what you think you can do uphill, but overall, it\u2019s a chance to get out there and have some fun, whether solo or in a team. Whilst there is some faster efforts needed to come out on top of any of these \u201cdisciplines\u201d, the aim of the game is just to get out there and enjoy yourself at whatever pace suits you.\n\nThe added extra this time is not only an extra hour, explained below, but the plan is to tie this into the elevation for a group effort for a BTR Everest Challenge, more details around this when I can get a team entry together, but really keen to try and pudh the limits of what has been done before.\n\nDetails:\nDate: 26th October - Backup date is the week after\nTime: 6am-1pm - (1 hr per week it too Hialry to conquer everest!)\nLocation: The Wither Hills, Basecamp: Sutherland Stream picnic area - this will be where we have the whiteboard & a bit of an \"Aid station/Bag drop\" situation going on.\n\nDisciplines:\n- \"Vernon Vert Masters\" Highest total elevation (solo/team) - pretty self explanatory, but between the hours of 6 am- 1pm any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day (solo or in a team) counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n\n- \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop (solo/team) - Crush the covenant Loop is a 3.75km, 300m vert loop running from Sutherland Stream Picnic Area to the Mt Vernon Summit & then back down again, the loops can be run in whichever direction you would like, just be aware that this is a 2-way track and there will be a bit more traffic than you would usually see up on it. The aim of the game here is to get as many laps in as possible between 6 am-1pm; this will also count toward your elevation total for the \"Vernon Vert Masters\"\n\nThe Basics:\n- This is an open event to anyone who wants to participate\n- The event is open from 6am-1pm - any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n- We will have a basecamp/aid station at the Sutherland stream picnic spot. This will be the hub for the meet-up and the start/finish line for the laps of \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d.\n- No minimum time, you can start whenever you like in the 6 am-1pm timeframe and go for as long as you would like.\n-You can do as many laps/summits/cumulative elevation as you like/can within the timeframe.\n- Teams - Teams can be between 2-5 people for the overall elevation challenge, and your total elevation will be your total accumulated. You will need to pre-register your team with Mikey before the day so that we can have you on the scoreboard.\n- You will need to confirm your solo/teams total elevation with Basecamp by 1.30pm on the day, in person. If you are unable to do this for whatever reason, you will need to confirm and prove details via message or screenshots so we can add them to the total tally.\n\n\nWho's up for some hills?\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nWe at Blenheim Trail Runners don\u2019t see ourselves as event organisers and as such, do not have any consent or insurance; we deem this as a \u201cClub Meet-up\u201d.\nWith that, the expectation is that you are 100% responsible for yourself and take part at your own risk.\nBe aware, as this isn't a formal event, there won't be any official timekeeping, marshals or trail markers. There will be DIY DIY-type whiteboard to note down your shared laps & elevation, and we will provide details via trail maps for the \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop.\nWe are unable to provide any/can not be held responsible for: Urgent medical attention (we will however, assist wherever possible, there will be a first aid kit at base camp), nutrition, hydration ( there is public access throughout the hills and in two points on the \u201ccrush the Covenant\u201d loop), the condition of the trail on the day or the weather.\n\n",

    "description": "Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2, Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2\nThe Second coming of the \"Crush the Vernon\" Vert Day is just around the corner, We had such a great time last time and its smack bang into the point where everyone needs elevation for events so i thought it would be silly not to bring it back!\n\n\"Crush the Vernon\" is a couple of fun endurance challeges to get us up into the Wither Hills for a big vert day!\nThis event will push you to the red line, boasting both as much high-level uphill suffering as you can possibly endure whilst building a steady accumulation of regret over 6 hours on the trails.\nIt\u2019s an event that's built to stretch the boundaries of what you think you can do uphill, but overall, it\u2019s a chance to get out there and have some fun, whether solo or in a team. Whilst there is some faster efforts needed to come out on top of any of these \u201cdisciplines\u201d, the aim of the game is just to get out there and enjoy yourself at whatever pace suits you.\n\nThe added extra this time is not only an extra hour, explained below, but the plan is to tie this into the elevation for a group effort for a BTR Everest Challenge, more details around this when I can get a team entry together, but really keen to try and pudh the limits of what has been done before.\n\nDetails:\nDate: 26th October - Backup date is the week after\nTime: 6am-1pm - (1 hr per week it too Hialry to conquer everest!)\nLocation: The Wither Hills, Basecamp: Sutherland Stream picnic area - this will be where we have the whiteboard & a bit of an \"Aid station/Bag drop\" situation going on.\n\nDisciplines:\n- \"Vernon Vert Masters\" Highest total elevation (solo/team) - pretty self explanatory, but between the hours of 6 am- 1pm any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day (solo or in a team) counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n\n- \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop (solo/team) - Crush the covenant Loop is a 3.75km, 300m vert loop running from Sutherland Stream Picnic Area to the Mt Vernon Summit & then back down again, the loops can be run in whichever direction you would like, just be aware that this is a 2-way track and there will be a bit more traffic than you would usually see up on it. The aim of the game here is to get as many laps in as possible between 6 am-1pm; this will also count toward your elevation total for the \"Vernon Vert Masters\"\n\nThe Basics:\n- This is an open event to anyone who wants to participate\n- The event is open from 6am-1pm - any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n- We will have a basecamp/aid station at the Sutherland stream picnic spot. This will be the hub for the meet-up and the start/finish line for the laps of \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d.\n- No minimum time, you can start whenever you like in the 6 am-1pm timeframe and go for as long as you would like.\n-You can do as many laps/summits/cumulative elevation as you like/can within the timeframe.\n- Teams - Teams can be between 2-5 people for the overall elevation challenge, and your total elevation will be your total accumulated. You will need to pre-register your team with Mikey before the day so that we can have you on the scoreboard.\n- You will need to confirm your solo/teams total elevation with Basecamp by 1.30pm on the day, in person. If you are unable to do this for whatever reason, you will need to confirm and prove details via message or screenshots so we can add them to the total tally.\n\n\nWho's up for some hills?\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nWe at Blenheim Trail Runners don\u2019t see ourselves as event organisers and as such, do not have any consent or insurance; we deem this as a \u201cClub Meet-up\u201d.\nWith that, the expectation is that you are 100% responsible for yourself and take part at your own risk.\nBe aware, as this isn't a formal event, there won't be any official timekeeping, marshals or trail markers. There will be DIY DIY-type whiteboard to note down your shared laps & elevation, and we will provide details via trail maps for the \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop.\nWe are unable to provide any/can not be held responsible for: Urgent medical attention (we will however, assist wherever possible, there will be a first aid kit at base camp), nutrition, hydration ( there is public access throughout the hills and in two points on the \u201ccrush the Covenant\u201d loop), the condition of the trail on the day or the weather.\n\n",

RAIN or SHINE, get ready to have fun!\n\nWe know K\u0101piti Run for Youth helps to support amazing community work done by local fundraising partners. We have 13 incredible fundraising partners you can choose to support and raise funds for. We are very proud of them all and the work they do to uplift the youth of K\u0101piti. Each partner brings something unique to the table, from providing essential resources and mentorship to creating spaces where young people can thrive. By supporting rangatahi through education, creativity, employment, and well-being initiatives, they ensure our youth are not just supported but empowered to reach their full potential. Our partners are creating a brighter tomorrow for the young people of K\u0101piti!\n\nIn the beginning K\u0101piti Run for Youth was created by Web Genius as their way as a local business to \u2018give back\u2019 to the community so, more than a decade on we can proudly say the event is sustainable and is popular with all sorts, young and old, the fit and not so fit. K\u0101piti Run for Youth has raised $280,003 for rangatahi since inception in 2011.

Whether it's a leisurely stroll or a mad dash to be the first across the finish, you choose the event that suits you best, and which of our amazing fundraising partners you're going to raise funds for. On race day grab your dog and your mates and head down to the beach for fun, family and fitness. Registration takes place from 8.30am to 9.45am with a briefing at 9.45am and all walkers and runners starting together at 10am.\n\nOnce your profile is set-up online, let your family, friends and work mates know so they can sponsor your efforts.

    "description": "Porirua Parkrun, What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

It can also help in your realist drawing, painting and invented subjects and environments.

Known for his raw vocals, heartfelt lyrics, and a genre-defying blend of folk, blues, rock, and soul, Shawn has captivated audiences around the globe.\nFollowing a massive international tour and the rise of his hit song \"Through the Valley\" -featured in the critically acclaimed The Last of Us series - Shawn is thrilled to announce his debut run across Aotearoa.\nCatch him live this October for three unforgettable shows:\nWednesday, October 15 - Loons, Christchurch\nThursday, October 16 - San Fran, Wellington\nFriday, October 17 - Double Whammy, Auckland\nTickets are on sale this Friday the 30th of May at 1:00 pm\nPre sale starts tomorrow, Thursday the 29th of May at 1:00 pm\nDon't miss this rare chance to experience the intensity and emotion of Shawn James in an intimate live setting. Tickets are expected to move fast - secure yours now!\n\"Hey there, this is Shawn James. I\u2019ve had way too many writers think they could sum me up & relay what I\u2019m about from an hour long conversation so they could write my \u201cbio\u201d but I\u2019ve had it. Screw that. I\u2019ll tell it in my own words.\nI was born & raised in Chicago, Illinois. I grew up on the south side of the city where I attended a gospel church. I was always around a lot of heartfelt soulful music & hardworking, real, down to earth people. Although I no longer abide by any religion, I value the times I had and how they shaped me to be what I am now. I\u2019ve moved around quite a bit living in all different parts of the US.\nWhile absorbing all sorts of different cultures from here & around the world, I\u2019ve developed my own sound. I started releasing my own music in 2012 and haven\u2019t stopped since. I play a wide range of music from folk to blues, r&b, Gospel to rock, metal & alotta things in between. The main constant amongst all the genres would be that it\u2019s all done with emotion, feeling, heart & a lotta soul. I mean what I say & deeply feel what I play.\nI play covers of songs I dig sometimes and although some people may only know me because of those, I\u2019m hardly just a cover artist.\nIf you come see me play live and expect just one style or aspect of what I do, you may be disappointed to learn that our shows are a roller coaster of emotions, musical styles, intensity & energy. I get bored easily & love to mix things up. Be ready & bring your ear plugs just in case..\nI\u2019ve always been the underdog so to speak since I\u2019ve never had the backing of a large record label, big marketing firm or massive PR company & I truly like it that way. I feel as though I\u2019ve earned what I have through hard work, determination, a good bit of luck & the great relationships with people I\u2019ve made along the way. I\u2019ve learned a lot of lessons the hard way being in this \u201cmusic business industry\u201d and that\u2019s alright by me.\nI\u2019ve seen that with your support (the listeners out there) I can make my wildest dreams come true.\nIf you want to listen to an artist that\u2019s authentic, genuine & original then you\u2019ve come to the right place. I hope you enjoy the music & will join me on this journey that I\u2019m so extremely grateful to be on.\nThank you all so very much.\nLove,\nShawn James\" ",

It draws inspiration from urban isolation and the weight of expectations. Tracks from the EP have landed on major Spotify and Apple playlists. Reflecting the office environment, familiar to many, this performance will bring to life the themes from the EP in a host of ways.\n\nWith over 2.2 million streams across platforms and 1.8 million on Spotify alone, his impact is growing. Releases have landed on global and regional editorial playlists. His EPs\u2014Fantasy, Monarch, SugarCoated and now F.O.M.O \u2014have consistently showcased his range and evolution as an artist.\n\nSig Wilder & Friends blend kiwi authenticity with American grit, bringing you a well-worn handwritten journal of lived experiences rendered through metaphor, poetic prose, and the stylistic conventions of folk, alt-country and late-night heartbreak radio.\n\nJosh Glennie is a soulful singer/songwriter based in Wellington, New Zealand. He's made a name for himself playing in bands around Wellington and is now striking out with his own solo material. Together with Tarn, they have produced a new EP of songs that cut to the bone, focused around acoustic guitar and Josh's striking vocals. His New EP is expected late 2025/early 2026.\n\n",

    "description": "Raven Mavens Quartette in concert, Raven Mavens Quartette\nSuppose you can imagine the sound of the blues, spiced by flavours of the American songbook, folk, country, and even the rock and roll of Jerry Lee Lewis, driven by the unmistakable sound of boogie woogie piano. In that case, you have the Raven Mavens Quartette.  \n\nIt is both an accident and it isn\u2019t that this is an all-female group. The group had its genesis a decade ago when piano player and singer-songwriter Cindy Muggeridge encountered the singing and clarinet skills of Marian Carter. They formed the Raven Mavens as a duo that included a core of folk and blues, and exploited the singing talents of the pair through finely crafted harmonies.  \n\nThe success of their combination in playing local gigs and folk festivals opened up opportunities with other musicians, and the next step was the inclusion of drummer Anje Glindemann, who has played in a list of local bands, including Tin Pan Alley, Hen Picked and more recently the Salty Hearts. Anje can also be seen performing with Kapiti Coast singer-songwriter icon Andrew London.  And finally, the addition of multi-instrumentalist Kate Marshall. \u201cKate is an amazing player\u201d, Cindy says. \u201cShe can move as easily from piano accordion, to fiddle or flute, depending on what the song calls for - or she feels like playing!\u201d And of course, like the other members of the group, she sings.  \n\nThe instrumental diversity of the line-up was now established, but what also distinguishes this group is the addition of Cindy Muggeridge\u2019s original songs to the set. \u201cWriting my own songs has been part of the musical journey for me\u201d, says Cindy, \u201cand it just led naturally to offering some of them to the other singers in the group\u201d. The \u201cfun\u201d of their music and the unmistakable presence of four female musical masters is what they will be sharing when they play at The Offering as part of Greytown ArtTown.\n\nBuy tickets in advance here or txt bookings to 02102361951.\n\nPlease note The Offering is fully licensed and will be serving snacks and drinks. Please note this concert replaces Bob McNeill and Emily Roughton due to illness.",

The script is backed by evidence and forms parts of Charlizza Matehe\u2019s doctoral research on rangatahi suicide and mental health. It pays tribute to our very first suicide prevention show, Smoke & Mirrors, which toured Aotearoa in 2015 and ignited a kaupapa that has stood the test of time, while suitable for wh\u0101nau audience, parental guidance is advised due to sensitive themes around suicide and grief. This show was created to open honest, hopeful conversations around mental health and to remind our young people they are not alone.

This may be characterized by curfews, the dispensation of military tribunal rulings on civilians, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.

This is suspended in times of crisis to expedite justice\" (Martial Law Museum).\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY?\nHuman rights violations and extrajudicial killings are still on-going in the Philippines under President Bongbong Marcos, the son of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. who proclaimed Martial Law in 1972, and Vice President Sara Duterte, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte who spearheaded the violent War on Drugs in 2016 (Karapatan).\nWHY WOULD I WANT TO JOIN THE FILM SCREENING?\nThe film screening is for anyone who is keen to learn about the Martial Law Era, wants to share their experience during the Martial Law (or something similar) through group discussion, wants to meet new people, wants to watch a Philippine film/documentary, or just wants to have snacks.\nI WANT TO JOIN BUT I'M FROM T\u0100MAKI MAKAURAU / CHRISTCHURCH / THE PHILIPPINES.\nWe will stream the film through Zoom for viewers outside Te Whanganui-a-Tara, however, there may be internet and other technical difficulties during the event itself.

Forster to dazzling life in the Florentine countryside and in the well-appointed homes of the English Edwardian upper classes. A comedy of manners with a quick wit and impeccable comic timing, A Room With A View is also a portrait of the quiet solitude that lies beneath Forster\u2019s characters, and of the need for human connection in a world of rigid convention.\n\nThe young Englishwoman Lucy Honeychurch (played by Helena Bonham Carter), arrives in Florence on a Baedecker-style grand tour with her aunt Charlotte Bartlett (Maggie Smith). Through a series of events involving English expatriates Miss Eleanor Lavish, an unflappable novelist (Judi Dench), and the Emersons, a free-thinking father and son (played by Denholm Elliot and Julian Sands), Lucy\u2019s life is changed forever under a loggia in Florence and in the Tuscan countryside.\n\nIvory\u2019s delicate and playful direction spirits us from an adventure in the back alleys of Florence, lost with Dench and Smith, to the lace-parasolled rigidity of English lawn parties. Shot on location in and around Florence (including unforgettable scenes in the Piazza della Signoria and at Giotto\u2019s frescoes in Santa Croce), A Room With A View made stars not only of Bonham Carter, Day Lewis and Sands, but of the Tuscan landscapes and Puccini arias (as sung by Kiri Te Kanawa) featured throughout.\n\nDirector\nJames Ivory\n\nProducer\nIsmail Merchant\n\nCast\nMaggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Denholm Elliot, Julian Sands",

When a photographer confined to his apartment begins to suspect that one of his neighbours has committed a murder, he sets off a chain of events that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats 70 years later.",

He made four feature-length films during New Zealand\u2019s silent film era, later navigating the financial challenges of accessing new sound equipment to make documentaries, educational films, and two more feature films \u2014 Rewi\u2019s Last Stand (1940) and the first New Zealand film to be shot in colour, To Love a M\u0101ori (1972).\n\nDrawing on research for her biography of Rudall Hayward and his family, Annabel Cooper will explore his enduring contributions to cinema, his collaborative work with his wives Hilda and Ramai, and the cultural legacy he left behind.\n\nA Friends of the Turnbull Library event\nThe Friends of the Turnbull Library, Ng\u0101 Hoa o te Whare Pukapuka Turnbull, offers a monthly programme of free public talks. These talks are held in the National Library in Wellington and on Zoom. Some of these talks will be repeated in Auckland. The public programme highlights the work of researchers who draw on Turnbull material for their projects and staff who care for and research the collections.\n\nAbout the speaker\nAssociate Professor Annabel Cooper taught at the University of Otago for 30 years, and published on a number of New Zealand topics including gender history and film. Her last book, Filming the Colonial Past: The New Zealand Wars on Screen, is the subject of an exhibition, He Riri Awatea: Filming the New Zealand Wars, curated with Ariana Tikao for the New Zealand Portrait Gallery and now showing at Canterbury Museum.\n\n",

The inclusion of considerable footage from Jacinda's partner Clarke Gayford provides a deeply personal view of life as the Prime Minister in very challenging times.\n(Los Angeles Times review) 'Prime Minister' is not interested in wrangling, dealing and lawmaking, or even the nuts and bolts or her progressive views. .. But in the fleet, pacey manner of the editing, toggling between private and public moments with highlight-reel efficiency, the film is a stirring glimpse of top-down kindness as a winning leadership style.",

    "description": "Teaching Well - Supportive schools for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), With the growing emphasis on staff wellbeing there is a plethora of workplace mental wellbeing programmes on offer. However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages. In fact, the staff consultation is, in itself, is a wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 30% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions. Post workshop consulting services such as mentoring the development of or reviewing a staff wellbeing plan can also be provided.\nPost Workshop Consult:\nSchools and Kuras have the option of a 90 minute consult with Barry in 2026 to review their staff wellbeing plan.\nBarry has worked in mental wellbeing promotion and suicide prevention/postvention for 36 years at the local, national and international levels.  His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs. \nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.  In recognition of his outstanding contribution to mental wellbeing and suicide prevention, he was awarded in 2016 the NSW Mental Health Commissioner's Community Champion Award.  He currently sits on the Health and Disability Ethics Committee.\nBarry has lectured on wellbeing both nationally and internationally and been appointed to numerous government advisory committees on mental wellbeing and suicide prevention.

He wrote the first national guidelines for suicide prevention in Australian schools and undertook a review of the NZ guidelines.\nAs a Health Sociologist and Public Health practitioner, Barry has a long-term interest in the social and cultural determinants of wellbeing, especially the role of gender and he brings a wealth of knowledge and passion for promoting wellbeing in men. He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing. He uses a population health and systems change approach, drawing on transformational change theory and collective impact.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to promote well wh\u0101nau, workplaces and communities and for the incorporation of wellbeing principles in public policy and social outcomes such as education, training and employment.\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

(Burst blood vessels in the brain).\n-Blood thinning medication. (Unfortunately, the blood thinners used to prevent such blood clots can increase the risk of bleeding in the brain, a cause of hemorrhagic stroke).\n-Pregnancy or possible pregnancy\n-Asthma\n-Mental Contraindications\n-Substance dependence & addiction (Deep breathwork journeys are not always appropriate for those who are still addicted to a substance, as it tends to raise suppressed or repressed material for processing. However, if you\u2019re currently in recovery, this can be extremely healing, and help you discover the deeper patterns that gave rise to this addiction. (Grof, 1985: 267 \u2013 268).\n-Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or psychosis\n-Hospitalisation for emotional crises in the last 10 years\n-Psychological conditions and diagnoses, which preclude safe emotional release.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the above, please inform Sarah.\n\n*Tickets are non-refundable, but are transferrable with 24 hours notice required.\n\n",

The book will be launched by Charlotte MacDonald.\n\nTuesday 7 October, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nAll welcome!\n\n'Existing views of Featherston are fragmentary, negative and not very satisfactory. He was the \u201clittle Doctor\u201d, a single-minded despot wielding tyrannical power and casting an oppressive shadow. As I began to understand more of his life, I realised that there was little appreciation of a man who had contributed so much.\u2019 \u2014John E.Martin\n\nIsaac Featherston was at the heart of some of the most significant developments in New Zealand from the 1840s colonisation by the New Zealand Company to the abolition of the provinces in 1876. A doctor, newspaper editor and politician, he advocated for the provinces against the domination of central government, while also being primarily responsible for the relocation of the capital from Auckland to Wellington in 1865.\n\nKnown amongst M\u0101ori as \u2018Petatone\u2019 and with a reputation for directness and honesty, he was at the very centre of P\u0101keh\u0101\u2013M\u0101ori relations, and in his 1857 official portrait is depicted alongside leading rangatira Te Puni and Wi Tako.\n\nAbout the author: Dr. John E. Martin has researched and written about New Zealand history since the 1980s, teaching in universities and employed as a historian in the public sector. He was parliamentary historian in the 2000s and 2010s. His publications include rural and labour history, the history of science and engineering, and social and political history. His books include The Forgotten Worker (1990), People, Politics and Power Stations (1991 and 1998), Holding the Balance (1996), The House: New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives, 1854\u20132004 (2004), Parliament\u2019s Library (2008), Honouring the Contract (2010), Illuminating Our World (2017), A Colonist\u2019s Gaze (2018) and most recently Empire City: Wellington Becomes the Capital of New Zealand (2022).",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods. Her works have appeared in the Politics, International Politics, Political Science, PS: Political Science & Politics, Journal of Contemporary China, Pacific Review, and Asian Security.\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 04:30 PM - 05:30 PM\nWelcome reception with refreshments and light catering\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 06:30 PM\nKeynote address: Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal Intern\nHost: Christina Lai\n\n\n",

HRCA wants to see that recommendation enacted.\n\nNew Zealand has a history for bold world leading policy reform: Woman\u2019s Right to Vote; Decriminalisation of Sex Work; National Needle Exchange, Same Sex Marriage and most recently Drug Checking.\n\nThis half day Symposium will provide clear evidence why major law reform is necessary and detail the foundations upon which Aotearoa NZ can once again be innovative and lead the way with new drug laws based on evidence, research and experience -providing a safer environment for future generation.\n\nHarm Reduction Coalition Aotearoa are delighted to have assembled a group of respected independent thinkers with vast experience of drug policy in Aotearoa and beyond, to reflect on the impact of the MoDA and to identify the principles and values needed to underpin new drug laws.\n\nWarren Young: Prof. of Law & Former Deputy President New Zealand Law Commission.\nKirsten Gibson: Chair of Harm Reduction Coalition Aotearoa and Qualitative Researcher.\nFiona Hutton: Associate Prof. Institute of Criminology, Victoria University of Wellington.\nAdam Dorsett: 40 yrs Living/Lived Experience of Prohibited Drug Use, 25yrs in Prison.\nJulian Buchanan: Former UNODC Advisor and Criminology Professor.\n\nNOTE:\nThis event is free and open to the public on a 'first come first served' basis.\nHowever, eventfinda ticket holders will be guaranteed a seat.",

    "description": "The Liberal International Order as a Core-Periphery Order: An Alternative History with Multiple Deep Contestations, I offer an alternative macrohistory of the Liberal International Order (LIO) that was explicitly designed to perpetuate Western dominance and American hegemony. The LIO is better understood as a core-periphery order because inequality between the Western-core and the \u2018Restern\u2019-periphery was constitutive of it. (Re-)Imperialism\u2014not just liberalism\u2014remained a central ordering mechanism well after 1945. I show the two-way deep contestations between the liberal and anticolonial ordering projects, especially at the 1955 Bandung Conference. Contra the post-LIO pessimism of disorder/chaos, I argue that the normative agency of the Southeast Asian states informed by the legacy of Bandung is heralding a multiplex, multi-regional world order. As the declining inequality between the West and Asia transforms the core-periphery LIO, the emergent decentered world order will lack a core, whether Western/liberal or Asian. This deep transformation should be welcomed, not deeply contested, although coexistence and global integration require embracing deep pluralism, not liberalism.\nManjeet S. Pardesi is Associate Professor of International Relations in the Political Science and International Relations Programme, and Asia Research Fellow at the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. His research interests include World Orders and World/Global History, Great Power Politics, Asian security, and the Sino-Indian rivalry.

We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle.

Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\n",

Maitreya, the World Teacher, and his group The Masters of Wisdom are here - not as religious teachers - to inspire all people to create a civilisation based on sharing, justice and peace; and for humanity to act to do the work to share and save our world.\n\nHumanity at spiritual crossroads\n\nHumanity is at crossroads. One path into the future leads to increasing social and economic division, environmental destruction, war and planetary peril. The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\n\nMaitreya\u2019s priorities\n\nTo help humanity in its task of global transformation, Maitreya has formulated certain priorities. They cover the essential needs of all people, every woman, man and child: an adequate supply of food\u037e housing for all; healthcare and education as basic universal rights. Other top priorities include the restoration of the environment and the establishment of peace.\n\nThe key to achieving these goals requires a major shift of present mind-set and thinking, structures and systems \u2013 and more equitable sharing of the world\u2019s food and resources. To realise humanity is one global family and the planet is a living being.

Born into a family of musicians, he began playing music at a young age and later studied classical guitar. His journey led him to Montreal, where he explored jazz, world music, and spiritual sound traditions.\n\nExtensive travels in Asia and Europe deepened his connection with Indian music and yogic philosophy. He studied Tibetan singing bowls in Kathmandu and Varanasi, and has since worked with a wide range of instruments including the sitar, esraj, bansuri, harmonium, flutes, gongs, and voice.\n\nClaudio\u2019s work blends technical skill, deep presence, and a profound respect for the healing power of sound.\n\nLearn more or listen to Claudio\u2019s music here:\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/claudioescutiasounds\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/claudio_yoga_sound_healing\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/soundhealingyogamusicclaudio\n\n\n",

After being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition at the age of eleven that left him paralyzed from the waist down, Wes experienced a miraculous recovery for which the doctors themselves had no medical explanation. This experience, along with a great deal of study and soul searching in his later teen years, solidified his interest in faith and in engaging the beliefs and worldview perspectives of others. He spent his high school years in Northern Ontario and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and three children.\n\nWesley is currently the Central Canada Director for Apologetics Canada and has been a guest on a variety of public platforms, from The Joe Rogan Experience and Piers Morgan Uncensored, to Apologia Radio and Daily Dose of Wisdom. He has participated in numerous public dialogues, debates, and interfaith events on issues of belief and religion globally.\n\nHe holds a BA in sociology from York University, a Masters of Theological Studies from Tyndale University, and is currently doing a PhD in New Testament at the University of Toronto\u2019s Wycliffe College.\n\n",

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Porirua will show you how.  \nMost Porirua homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nPorirua has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Porirua.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Porirua is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",
