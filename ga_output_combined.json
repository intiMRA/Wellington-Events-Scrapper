It was a huge success, with over 250 audience members and 52 artists over our four sessions. Audiences were raving about the musical variety and great talent they found at the Racket Lounge, and as one audience member commented; \u201cWell done\u2026do it again!\u201d So, we listened, and the Racket Lounge is back for round two! Once again hosted at Bedlam & Squalor (above the Rogue & Vagabond), we welcome audiences, composers and performers back for another four concerts full of innovative, fun, and chill music. From classical to pop covers, video game soundtracks to original compositions, there's something for everyone to sink their teeth into at The Racket Lounge!\nEven if you've never been to a classical music concert before, this one is for you. With a 'Choose your price' model you can afford to give it a go - and you might even find something you like!\nA Flexible Price, So You Can Take A Chance on Something New:\nOur prices range from $5 to $100, just pick the ticket price you feel like paying. At The Racket Lounge, we believe everyone should have access to high-quality but affordable art. If you're a bit strapped for cash right now, but still want a good night out, no worries! Just book yourself a $5 ticket! If you can afford to pay a little more and want to do some good for your community, then pick one of our higher ticket prices and rest assured that your dollars are going towards funding great, accessible art in your city.\nAll proceeds from ticket sales will go directly into presenting the next Racket Lounge, including paying musicians and artists, hiring instruments and marketing costs. Plus, by choosing a higher price point, you're ensuring that we're able to continue to offer tickets at a lower price point for those who need it.\nPlease note: Bedlam & Squalor is a licenced venue, so under 18s must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Everyone must bring ID.\nSupported by Wellington City Council.\n",

The book will be launched by Always Becominging.\nWednesday 3 September, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nAll welcome!\nWhat would he have wanted? As little fuss as possible. But, reading between the lines: a little help. All the latest gossip and complaints. An arse that is not wrong. Opulence. One leap from the rope ladder. The final word.\nIt\u2019s What He Would\u2019ve Wanted is the sixth book of poetry from the author of the acclaimed The Stupefying. In this hilarious and affecting new work, Nick Ascroft writes of lost friends, new frailties, new braveries, and being stuck in an organ pipe during a recital and not wanting to bother anyone about it. Yes, there are poems of cycling into dead-end utility holes but also poems of trembling resolve and arriving at work as aged as the night sky after completing the morning school drop-off. This is the best collection yet by one of the most exciting and mercurial poets writing in Aotearoa today.\nAbout the author:\nNick Ascroft is the author of five previous poetry collections with Te Herenga Waka University Press, most recently The Stupefying (2022) and Moral Sloth (2019). Living in Thorndon, he is a public servant and the president of Scrabble Wellington.\nCover design by Todd Atticus. ",

The winner of the Golden Bear 2025 is a lucid and tender chronicle of the unforgettable experience of first love.\n\nOriginally intended as the second chapter in his trilogy and released in Norway as such, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Dreams ended up premiering internationally as the last. But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Being open to these moments enhances our lives and the lives of those around us,' Dixey says.\n'In psychology, these tiny moments that stimulate positive feelings are called glimmers.'\nGold is a chemical element with the symbol Au and atomic number 79.\n'Welcome to Glimmers of Gold.'\nAbout Jo Dixey\nDixey is a Royal School of Needlework trained embroiderer. She teaches small groups a variety of embroidery techniques, works on commissions which have included large altar cloths, university banners and work for the fashion and movie industries, and repairs old embroideries. She holds exhibitions of her embroidered pieces every few years.\nIn 2017, Dixey published her first book Stitch People, which was later re-released as Creative Thread.\nHer work is held in private and public collections in New Zealand and overseas.

I moved to beautiful Aotearoa from Sweden a few years ago, and my journey with ceramics started in 2023 and I've been elbows deep in clay ever since. I use flora found all over the world, and outside my doorsteps, to shape my artwork. My ceramic pieces are all hand made and no piece will be the other alike. I mainly throw a shape on the wheel and then let it tell me what it wants to become.\nThis exhibition is guided by Ecclesiastes 3:1-11. I think life is beautiful in it's times of joy, but also in the times of struggle, where we can grow and learn.\nA Time for Everything\nThere is a time for everything,\nand a season for every activity under the heavens:\na time to be born and a time to die,\na time to plant and a time to uproot,\na time to kill and a time to heal,\na time to tear down and a time to build,\na time to weep and a time to laugh,\na time to mourn and a time to dance,\na time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,\na time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,\na time to search and a time to give up,\na time to keep and a time to throw away,\na time to tear and a time to mend,\na time to be silent and a time to speak,\na time to love and a time to hate,\na time for war and a time for peace.\nWhat do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.\n",

Once you register, you'll receive an acknowledgement from Humanitix, followed by a second email directly from the Holocaust Centre of New Zealand.\n2025 Annual Kristallnacht Commemorative Concert\nEscape & Exile \u2013 East & West\nJoin the Holocaust Centre of New Zealand for a poignant evening of remembrance and reflection. The Te K\u014dk\u012b Trio, featuring Inbal Megiddo (cello), Martin Riseley (violin), and Jian Liu (piano), will be joined by Professor Kim Cunio, Head of Te K\u014dk\u012b / New Zealand School of Music, in a powerful performance commemorating Kristallnacht.\n This concert commemorates Kristallnacht, or \u201cThe Night of Broken Glass,\u201d the horrific pogroms of 9\u201310 November 1938, across Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland. This state-sponsored violence saw the murder of an estimated 91 Jews, the arrest of 30,000, and the destruction of hundreds of synagogues and Jewish businesses. Kristallnacht is widely regarded as a pivotal moment, marking the escalation of Nazi persecution and often described as the beginning of the Holocaust.\n The Nazis sought to silence the music and art of all those they deemed \"untermenschen,\" including six million Jews and other victimised groups. This concert stands as a powerful act of defiance and remembrance, allowing us to hear the voices of those who were murdered, forced into hiding, or exiled. It celebrates their artistic brilliance and ensures their memory lives on.\n This year's theme is \"Escape and Exile: East and West.\" In the tradition of paying musical tribute to all victims, we will honour the music of Jewish composers from across the globe\u2014from the Netherlands and Nazi-occupied Germany in the West, all the way to Iraq and Shanghai in the East.\n The programme will feature pieces that honour:\nErna Weiss Falk, a talented Jewish opera singer from Cologne, whose promising career was cut short by anti-Jewish laws. She and her family ultimately escaped to the Netherlands.\nBrigitte Schiffer, a young composer who completed her doctorate in Berlin before fleeing the Nazis to Egypt, where she became the director of the Higher Music Education Institute for women.\nThe Al Kuwaiti brothers, Jewish pioneers of modern Iraqi music, survived the Farhud, a devastating pogrom inspired by Nazi ideology that targeted Baghdad's Jewish population on June 1-2, 1941, coinciding with the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. Despite their legacy resonating across the Middle East through radio, their contributions were erased from Iraqi history.\nFerdinand Adler, a Hungarian Jewish violinist who miraculously escaped from the Dachau concentration camp, to Shanghai.\n Join us for this important event as we mourn the lives lost and celebrate the resilience of the human spirit. We look forward to welcoming you.\n Details:\nWellington: Sunday, 9 November 2025\nAuckland: Monday, 10 November 2025\nDoors Open: 6:00 PM\nConcert Begins: 6:45 PM\nLocation: To Be Announced\n Please RSVP by Monday, 3 November 2025, to let us know if you can join us.",

    "description": "Manage Your Expectations, Created and Performed by Eliza Sanders\nProduced by House of Sand\nDirected by Charley Allanah\n\nYou decide the ending\u2026\n\nSolo performer Eliza Sanders has a simple task: to tell you everything that will happen in the show, so you can decide if you would like to see it. Nothing is ever so simple.\n\nThis genre-defying work of dance, theatre, live film, clown and absurd philosophising takes the idea of the \u2018trigger warning\u2019 to its absurdist extreme to question how \u2018informed\u2019 consent can really be, and asking \u2018How much do you really want to know?\u2019\n\nCreated and performed by multi-award-winning maverick of the stage Eliza Sanders, Manage Your Expectations helps us to see the limits of the power to communicate and our failures to say what we mean. Through movement, multimedia, and razor-sharp wit, it examines the impossibility of perfect communication, musing on the influence of context, identity and personal history while creating something beautiful from our collective mess.\n\n\u201cClever, witty, evocative, subversive, immersive, despairing, poignant, personal and universal\u201d \u2014 Deirdre Tarrant, Theatreview\n\n\u201cBeautifully vulnerable\u201d \u2013 Chloe Jaques, Theatreview, 2024\n\nFull of vigour, energy, chaos and a hint of confrontation, Manage Your Expectations is a mind (and body) bending show about how we connect in an increasingly complex world. And you decide the ending\u2026\n\nContent warning: this show contains explicit content, mild coarse language, heavy nudity, themes of abortion and rape.\n\nWINNER: Best Performer, Whang\u0101rei Fringe 2024\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance, NZ Fringe 2024\nWINNER: San Diego Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Best in Fringe, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Innovative Work, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Sydney Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Auckland Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Melbourne Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Adelaide Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Original Production, Wellington Theatre Awards 2024\n\nTues 16 \u2013 Sat 20 Sept 2025\nQ&A and Choose Your Price Night: Wed 17 Sept\nRelaxed Performance: Thurs 18 Sept\nCirca Two\nTues \u2013 Fri 7.30pm, Sat 20 Sept 2.00pm & 7.30pm\nShow Duration: 75 minutes no interval\nRecommended Age 16+",

Over half of the country has been liberated by opposition armed groups, but the regime hangs on, using air strikes, forced conscription and brutality to control the main cities and areas of economic value. Amongst the opposition is the punk movement that has led protests, organised Food not Bombs groups, food gardens, social centres and other projects, both inside and outside the country, all run on the smell of an oily rag. Your dollar goes further when it\u2019s in the hands of punks.\n\nWe are screening Linda Linda Linda \u2013 a low-key, cheerful but by no means saccharine, 2005 Japanese film that actually gets punk. It has the same plot as every other rock movie, except this one is believable. Four grumpy teenagers are empowered through a willingness to accept outsiders, music and friendship.\n\nBurmese food from 6pm, a short talk about the situation at 7pm followed by the film.",

    "description": "Messengers, \u2018Animals first entered the imagination as messengers and promises,\u2019 John Berger.\nMessengers explores the enduring gaze shared between humans and other animals. The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

In the Val-d'Oise region, this community, originally from Turkey and Iraq, has lived since the 1980s in a rhythm marked by weddings, church services, and family meals.\nShaped by the exile of their parents and the persecution their community faced under the Turkish dictatorship and Daesh, S\u00e9miramis nurtures her roots in Assyrian civilization, originating from Mesopotamia. But the puzzle of her history no longer fits together as it once did.\nGradually, the elders are disappearing, taking with them an identity and culture that is 6,000 years old. How can this fracture be repaired, and this heritage preserved? Should they consider staying or returning to their ancestral homeland, now that peace has returned? Can one go back after decades of conflict? Can they rebuild and start anew to live in peace with themselves and others?\n\"Return to Babylon\" is a road movie from Sarcelles to Erbil, following S\u00e9miramis and her family on a journey that leads them to question their future in France and the fate of their community in the Middle East.\nA film by Marie Dault, S\u00e9miramis Ide, and S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nDirected by S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nScreen time: 52-minutes; French and Assyrian with subtitles\nLink to the English-subtitled trailer: https://www.instagram.com/p/DDzsYJzt_B9/\nThe screening event will be held at the Cockburn Street Chapel, 1 Cockburn Street, Kilbirnie, Wellington from 5-7pm.\n\nEntrance is free, but please register to confirm your attendance.\n\nWe welcome koha (donations) which will go towards supporting the ACEYA Wellington Branch's youth-focused activities and events.",

    "description": "The Amber Temple at Vogelmorn Upstairs, Wellington, The Amber Temple marries mysticism with gritty, ghoulish escapades of rogues and renegades. Vignettes of characters similar to you, similar to me, similar to someone you may have been or may one day become, all on the path towards the Amber Temple.\nFrom the bowels of the molten earth, to the jowls of the predatory opportunist, to the angel casting light from celestial constellations, you will find yourself wrapped in a web from a sliver of time, a faraway place, perhaps an unknown space, as musician and dancer weave their tall tales of trials and tribulations, mortal life and looming death, unwavering love and venomous hate, environmentalism and satirical social commentary.\nAn original music and interpretive dance collaboration between singer-songwriter Julian Temple and contemporary dancer Amber Stephens.\nTemple, known mostly for his work in the eponymous Julian Temple Band has written all new works for the project while Stephens, a trained contemporary ballet dancer and choreographer who ran her own dance company in Vienna, has choreographed the interpretive dance for this unique performance.\n\u201cA live dancer added a visceral element to an already emotional performance. Having a responsive artist interacting and interpreting the music through movement only heightened the experience. It bridged the gap between performer and audience.\u201d\n- Ed Castelow - Dictaphone Blues\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be a converted fan of The Amber Temple before they\u2019ve even finished their first song. There\u2019s an obvious sense of originality, coupled with carefully crafted dance moments and some of the most intense and outstanding folk songwriting you\u2019ve heard. There\u2019s a feeling though that nothing is premeditated and that improvisation is the star of the show - the kind of performance that requires decades of experience. Luckily for us, Julian and Amber have this in spades. Do yourself a favour, I guarantee you\u2019ve seen nothing like it.\u201d\n- Sam Cullen - Singer/Songwriter\n\u201cEven having an understanding of the type of show The Amber Temple would be putting on when booking them - I was blown away by the amount of drama, tension and world-building Julian & Amber are able to accomplish in such an agile performance. The Amber Temple is a totally unique and utterly engaging experience which should be seen and celebrated.\u201d\n- Chris Scott - Seaside Music\nShow starts at 7 Presale tickets $20 (+BF) via undertheradar.co.nz or $25 on the door\n\"Vogelmorn Upstairs is not a wheelchair accessible building.

The Griegol is a dark fantasy in the vein of Spirited Away, for older children and adults. Drawing from the techniques of silent film, it utilises silhouettes, smoke, puppetry, live music, and live animation. With the operation kept in sight, audiences see both the stage effects and how they are made. Combining hi-fi with lo-fi technology, and the mythic with the everyday, The Griegol is a show without words about death, love, and monsters. After winning Director, Composer, and Production of the Year at the 2022 Wellington Theatre Awards, and touring to the USA, The Griegol returns to the Hannah Playhouse this October.\n\nRecommended for ages 7+\nContains references to death and grief",

It is a world that, despite its historical setting, feels unnervingly close to our own.\nWith only ten dynamic performers, this is Henry the Fifth like never before: stripped back, sharp, and driven by the raw intensity of Shakespeare\u2019s text.\nExpect fast-paced storytelling, immersive staging, and a production that puts the audience at the heart of the battle.\nFull show duration: 95 min including a 15 min intermission.\n\u201cThis production epitomises what can be achieved when talent, teamwork, hard work, opportunity and passion combine.\u2019\u201d\nNZ Herald on The Tragedy of Macbeth ",

    "description": "Jonathan Kay - Massey University Lecturer/Master of Fine Arts Coordinator, Jonathan Kay is a photographic artist, researcher, and lecturer based at Massey University in Te Whanganui-a-Tara/Wellington. His work explores the intersection of art and science, using photography to reveal the unseen and challenge conventional notions of landscape. Over the past seven years, his research has focused on developing a site-specific and responsive approach to photographic interventions within the landscape.\nDrawing inspiration from scientific 'fieldwork,' Kay\u2019s practice involves close observation and data collection, using these methods to uncover new insights into specific environments. However, his approach extends beyond the typical scientific framework by leveraging the unique possibilities of the photographic medium. This process enables him to move beyond the traditional, idealized representation of landscapes, offering deeper, more complex interpretations.\nSeptember 25, Tararua Tramping Club (4 Moncrieff St, Mt Victoria), Doors Open at 7pm\nIf you\u2019re curious about the Wellington Photographic Society, you\u2019re welcome to attend two meetings for free before deciding whether to join.

This hands-on interaction brings a sense of movement and authenticity that\u2019s hard to achieve otherwise.\n\nThe sculpting process typically starts by analyzing the model\u2019s proportions and pose. A wire armature is built to support the structure and clay is gradually applied to develop the form to a one-third life size 750mm tall figure. From there the artist refines the shapes focusing on anatomical accuracy and expressive detail that give the sculpture its final character.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in traditional sculpture and the film industry Javier is not just a sculptor \u2014 he\u2019s a mentor. Trained in classical techniques he studied fine arts and took anatomy courses at medical school developing a rare combination of artistic and anatomical knowledge. He spent over five years at the world-renowned Weta Workshop contributing to major films and exhibitions and has worked across materials scales and digital technologies.\n\nMaterial is included in the price.\nArmature is supplied during the workshop.\nYou can buy our tools during the workshop if you like.\nTea\n\n",

    "description": "Financial Planning for Retirement, Financially successful people don\u2019t achieve their wealth by accident \u2013 they make and execute clear plans. Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".\n\n1 Day\nPresented by Paul and Mary-Ellen Gadd.",

    "description": "Hands-on Sourdough Workshop, Sourdough for Beginners - $120 (paid via internet banking)\nCome join us for a hands-on, in-person sourdough workshop at Willow Corner Collective headquarters (aka my home)! This workshop is currently the only hands-on sourdough workshop being offered in the Nelson region - I teach and demonstrate to you and then you get to mix and practice on your own dough as we go along.\nWhether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this event is perfect for anyone looking to master the art of making sourdough bread, learning from someone who has 10+ years of experience. Perhaps you've found all the Youtube tutorials and Instagram how-to's overwhelming and are keen to learn via an in-person class. Then this is for you! I've baked hundreds of loaves in the last year alone, sold at a market, and hosted a pop-up shop. However, my passion really lies with teaching others to bake their own sourdough in their own homes, for their own families (or small businesses - one day!).You will be taught, demonstrated to, and then you get to have a go yourself; whilst learning my tips and tricks along the way. Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes and troubleshoot guide\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 6-8pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. If for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though. In extenuating circumstances I may be able to hold your ticket for a future workshop; this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n*Payment to clear in bank account two days after ticket bought, after which time your ticket will be released on to someone else. Please pay immediately upon purchasing ticket.\n**All workshop info you need to know ahead of time is in the confirmation email. Please ensure you read this down to the bottom.\n***I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\n\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight! From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody",

    "description": "Jewellery-making in 8 weeks - Tuesday Eve Mixed Level, This class is mixed level, allowing beginners to work alongside advanced students. It starts on Tuesday, 14 October and runs for 8 weeks till Tuesday, 2 December, 5.30pm - 8pm.\nOur popular weeknight classes are the best way for beginners to get into jewellery making in a lively, warm and friendly environment.\n\nBeginners start with basic ring-making and stone-setting in copper or brass. Students will learn measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting and soldering. Then we move on to making a practice-ring set with a Cabochon stone (cabochon means it has a flat bottom and a smooth domed top) in a Bezel Setting. The stone-setting process teaches you many fundamental techniques in one project! As you work through your practice-ring and setting, you can move onto working in silver and produce another ring with a cabachon stone that you really love. This way you will learn the basics as you go on your practice-ring, before taking the next step in costly silver.\n\nLevel 2 students learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking as a way to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project so they have something to hone their skills that they are familiar with, as well as taking on a new skill. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet or a more complex bezel setting - for example a teardrop or soft square stone to take on bezels with corners!\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple projects they can work on self-directed in class: more chains or simple bezel settings are ideal - to help them strengthen their soldering skills - alongside a challenge project that might be a shelf setting (an adaptation of a bezel setting that can take faceted stones), a tube setting or a larger bezel setting for a box or brooch. Our tutors will work with you to discover your passions in the world of making, and to support your skills so you grow your understanding with each block you take. We recommend that students from level 3 and up take the occasional Technique class (for example - claw setting, enamelling, flush setting) and then bring those techniques into their projects in their block class to be supported in their practice and skill by their regular tutor.\n\nThis class fee does NOT include materials for any student.\nBeginners should expect to spend at least $60 on materials for their ring making project.\nAll metals and stones as well as quality findings and chains are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it thriftily in future projects!\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time please email us to arrange this ;)",

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa. This annual public lecture series recognises the legacy of the late Dr Michael Volkerling who was one of the principal architects of New Zealand's cultural and creative sectors.",

Unkovski\u2019s loveable debut, the first ever Macedonian film to be awarded at Sundance.\n\nStill reeling from the death of their mother and wife, Ahmet\u2019s family is broken. His father, struggling to come to terms with being sole provider and caretaker for the family, pulls Ahmet from school so he can care for their flock of sheep; meanwhile, his younger brother has become non-verbal since their mother\u2019s death. Music is both medicine and matchmaker for young Ahmet, who escapes his grief and the grim mundanity of life under his oppressive father by blasting beats from the world\u2019s jankiest stereo system to impress local girl Aya, back from Germany to be betrothed to an older man.\n\nIn this modern-day Romeo and Juliet, the Yuruk mountain village of Kodzalia takes the place of Verona, while the Montagues and Capulets make way for an eclectic support cast, with a technophobic imam, a souped-up tractor and a fluorescent pink sheep all taking the stage. If music be the food of love, then DJ Ahmet is a feast of thumping electro and dance-floor anthems that spur on the teenage protagonist as he fumbles through the throes of his first romance.

He takes to the stage at TSB Arena to contemplate the dazzling complexity of the universe and how it\u2019s built on profoundly simple principles. \nEmergence is also a scientific history of 400 years of human discovery.

    "description": "Teaching Well - Supportive schools for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), With the growing emphasis on staff wellbeing there is a plethora of workplace mental wellbeing programmes on offer. However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages. In fact, the staff consultation is, in itself, is a wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops.

Brain has been passionate about photography for over 40 years, beginning his career at the National Film Unit in the 1970s before joining Park Road Post Production as Head of Laboratory, Head of Picture, and Restoration Manager. His work in film sparked an interest in early photographic techniques, prompting him to master wet-plate collodion photography. In 2006, he was invited to assist leading wet-plate experts in the USA and has since taught many New Zealanders this challenging process. Jane, who attended Brian\u2019s workshop in 2014, later married him in 2019 and completed a photographic project in Carterton in 2016.\nAlthough Brian retired in 2015, he returned for short-term assignments at Park Road Post and part-time work at Archive NZ, supporting film archiving until mid-2023.

    "description": "Water Casting - Spring, This is a super quick 3-hour session, and is great fun to do with family or friends.\nWater casting is a really hands-on low-tech casting method that results in surprising and fun little forms that can be turned into pendants with amazing textures and shapes.\nYou will be guided through melting silver and pouring it into water to create little charms.\nExperiment with pouring at different heights to create different shapes.\nChoose one or a few of your favourites to have drilled and turn into simple pendants or earrings, or new charms for your bracelets!\nWe will use hardened jump rings to attach your water-cast pieces to either colourful cord or you can choose sterling silver chains which you can purchase for extra.\nThe technique will be demonstrated with important health and safety practices, then students will be guided to do at least a couple of casts, and should expect to have at least one successful item to clean up and finish in the class.\nA basic amount of metal allowance of a small amount of silver is included in your course costs, and if your projects go over that amount you can pay for the metal you use on the day via internet banking or cash.\nThis course is open to complete beginners and advanced makers. Extra materials such as chains and findings are available to purchase.\nFor health and safety reasons class participants must wear sturdy, closed toe shoes and have their hair tied back.\nWorkshop fee $128, Early bird $115 till 17 August.

    "description": "A Change Is Coming walk tour (Wellington Heritage Festival), A Change Is Coming walk tour (Wellington Heritage Festival)\n1pm, SUNDAY 19th OCTOBER 2025\n\n2025 marks the 40th anniversary of the introduction in 1985, of the Homosexual Law Reform bill. The bill set out to decriminalise homosexual activity between consenting adults and make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t the first attempt at homosexual law reform. Join us on this special 90-minute free walk tour to celebrate the people and movements that fought for a brighter future for rainbow communities.\n\nOur journey begins at the location of the first public meeting in New Zealand, advocating for homosexual law reform in 1967. This was two years before the Stonewall uprising in the U.S. which went on to ignite Gay Liberation around the world.\n\nThe tour ends at Parliament, where we honour the Members of Parliament who have championed equality over the last five decades.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll reflect on some of the difficult realities rainbow communities have faced, from the injustices of the legal system, to the stances of the medical profession, churches and the military. As the late activist Ralph Knowles recalls, \u201cAs far as medicine was concerned, it was sick. As far as the law was concerned, it was a crime. As far as the church was concerned, it was a sin.\u201d\n\nThough at times the stories are challenging, this walk tour is ultimately uplifting, as we pay tribute to our amazing rainbow kaumatua and allies who led the way.\n\nCOST: Free, but please register so we can manage the number of walkers: https://walktoursnz.wordpress.com/book/\n\nDATE/TIME: 1pm, Sunday 19th October 2025\n\nSTARTS: meet at the rugby sculpture, Jack Ilott Green, corner of Harris Street & Jervois Quay (just by Civic Square)\n\nENDS: Parliament grounds\n\nDURATION: 1 hour 30mins\n\nACCESSIBILITY: the tour is on flat public footpaths, with a light incline as we enter Parliament grounds. Tours are limited to approximately 20 walkers.\n\nThis tour is part of the amazing Wellington Heritage Festival - https://wellingtonheritagefestival.co.nz\n\n",

Then this Thursday is your night! Come join us at the Tawa Outlet Mall for an evening of Motogymkhana.\nAll skill levels are welcome.

And if anyone is struggling, we have a group of well-practiced riders to give you some pointers and help you out. Our only expectation is you're confident to ride on the road. The rest should come with a little bit of Thursday night practice.\nIf you're not comfortable doing it on your own pride and joy, there are club bikes that can be rented for the night. We just ask for a donation to help us cover rent, fuel and broken levers.\nUnfortunately, due to changes in our circumstances this year, we're a little short on cash-flow, and are asking for a gold-coin donation from anyone riding to help keep the lights on.\n",

Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years.

He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2025. We'll giveaway any spots remaining a few days before the first workshop of the course, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email poproximprov@gmail.com and we'll pop you on the SBL.

We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire!

As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits.

The streets after 2 a.m. and too many beers are alive with obstacles; cops are grumpy, goth girls are tempting, and the help of the Gods is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought. Betrayal, hurt, and anger push her to the edge making her act in ways she never thought she would. \u201cHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned.\u201d\n\nThe Devil is a Lover \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Love Labours Lost\u202fand Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Devil is an Ass\nSatan and two devils, Beelzebub and Pug, make a pact to travel to a 1920s speakeasy on Earth and abstain from corruption for 3 years.

Marion and Melanie are sure they\u2019ve committed the perfect murder by killing their friend Norman and hiding his body in a chest, a chest their select group of friends have been invited over to have a murder mystery games night around. It\u2019s foolproof, until the over analytical Constance comes to play\u2026\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew\nIn 1970's Aotearoa, sisters Katherina and Bianca find their love lives complicated by their father's order that one may not pursue romance unless the other follows suit. The sudden appearance of a charming factory owner and friend of Bianca's beau could mark a new hope for the two, but will this lead to an ocean of love or does something far more sinister lurk beneath the surface?\n\nGod\u2019s Gift \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Alchemist\nThe Carnival has come to town in 1615 London. Lovewit has gone to see the show, leaving her manor in the hands of Jeremy the Butler, the \u201cAlchemist,\u201d and Dol, a hardworking prostitute. Lovewit\u2019s house becomes a place for schemes, with ample opportunities to take money from foolish men. Will Dol be happy with her split of the money? Or will a surprise visitor shake things up?\n\nContent Forecast: mentions of and implied sexual violence and domestic abuse, mentions of drug use, strobe lighting, violence, coarse language, loud noises, haze, and smoke.",

    "description": "Electrify Wellington: how to save money on your energy bills feat. Mike Casey, It keeps getting more expensive to heat our homes and water, cook our meals and get around. But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

We share everything homegrown and homemade: Vegetables, fruits, herbs, plants, seedlings, flowers, seeds, baking, preserves, sauces, jam and all things yummy! You can also bring everything garden and kitchen related like empty containers, tools, labels, planting pots, worm juice, coffee grounds, gardening magazines, cook books, recipes, a SKILL\u2026possibilities are endless.\nThe key is that this is a cashless event, no koha can offered or accepted.\nThis is generally how a Crop Swap will run:\n2-2.15pm\n\u2022 People arrive with their crops and put them out on the tables provided.\n\u2022 You are then free to chat and mingle with your fellow garden enthusiasts, exchange tips, make new friends or just wait until it starts.\n2.15-2.45pm\n\u2022 We conduct a quick briefing outlining the guidelines for swapping.\n\u2022 If there is not a lot of people, we can listen to anyone who wants to introduce their crop.\n\u2022 Once everyone has placed their crops we like to do a Karakia to bless the kai. We want to emphasise our values regarding generous giving and mindful taking.\n2.45-3pm\n\u2022 Close out, put away tables and clear the hall.\nThe meetings will be held regularly on the 2nd Saturday of every month in Raumati and the last Saturday of every month in Waikanae.\nFurther information:\n1. There will be a koha food box for anyone who wants to donate food or seedlings in addition to their swaps. The Crop Swap team will distribute any koha crop and left over crops to local food pantries.\n2. If you do not have any crops to swap but need fresh fruit or veges for the next week, you can bring plants, flowers, seedlings, herbs, eggs, preserves, jams, baking, liquid manure, gardening books, magazines, planting containers, sometimes even chooks who need a new home! We want this to be accessible to everyone, especially those who are struggling to put fresh fruit and veges on the table!\n\n",

The script is backed by evidence and forms parts of Charlizza Matehe\u2019s doctoral research on rangatahi suicide and mental health. It pays tribute to our very first suicide prevention show, Smoke & Mirrors, which toured Aotearoa in 2015 and ignited a kaupapa that has stood the test of time, while suitable for wh\u0101nau audience, parental guidance is advised due to sensitive themes around suicide and grief. This show was created to open honest, hopeful conversations around mental health and to remind our young people they are not alone. We warmly encourage people working with youth, youth groups and community r\u014dp\u016b to attend together. Email for more information and group bookings\n\n",

He made four feature-length films during New Zealand\u2019s silent film era, later navigating the financial challenges of accessing new sound equipment to make documentaries, educational films, and two more feature films \u2014 Rewi\u2019s Last Stand (1940) and the first New Zealand film to be shot in colour, To Love a M\u0101ori (1972).\n\nDrawing on research for her biography of Rudall Hayward and his family, Annabel Cooper will explore his enduring contributions to cinema, his collaborative work with his wives Hilda and Ramai, and the cultural legacy he left behind.\n\nA Friends of the Turnbull Library event\nThe Friends of the Turnbull Library, Ng\u0101 Hoa o te Whare Pukapuka Turnbull, offers a monthly programme of free public talks. These talks are held in the National Library in Wellington and on Zoom. Some of these talks will be repeated in Auckland.

Her last book, Filming the Colonial Past: The New Zealand Wars on Screen, is the subject of an exhibition, He Riri Awatea: Filming the New Zealand Wars, curated with Ariana Tikao for the New Zealand Portrait Gallery and now showing at Canterbury Museum.\n\n",

This more advanced class is ideal for those who are already competent at soldering simple joins, annealing, and basic tool use on their own.\n\nStudents must have completed an 8-week block with ring-making and bezel settings or equivalent. If you have not done one of our 8-week beginner\u2019s classes or are unsure of your level because you may have done a few different shorter classes, please contact us and we can advise you.\n\nA more advanced set of students means that your tutor can support you and the group to take on more exciting and complex challenges. They will work with the group to find appropriate projects for you and for the class as a whole. Each 8-week block may focus on a particular skill topic, rather than doing loads of different topics with each student over the block. This means the students will benefit from a more in-depth learning experience, supported practice, and peer support from fellow students.\n\nLevel 2 students learn to solder more competently on their own using chain-making as a way to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project so they have something familiar to hone their skills on, as well as take on a new skill. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet, or a more complex bezel setting.\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple projects they can work on self-directed in class\u2014more chains or simple bezel settings are ideal to help them strengthen their soldering skills\u2014alongside a challenge project that might be a shelf setting (an adaptation of a bezel setting that can take faceted stones), a tube setting, or a larger bezel setting for a box or brooch.\n\nThis class fee does NOT include materials for any student. All metals and stones, as well as quality findings and chains, are available for purchase each week in the studio.

    "description": "Men's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection, Men's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\nMen\u2019s Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\n\nIn a world where men are often expected to have everything figured out, this gathering offers a space to be genuine, not perfect.\n\nThis is a free event, with an optional plant-based dinner available for $15. While there\u2019s no obligation to stay for dinner, sharing a meal together offers a meaningful way to strengthen connections. Andre and Sri Jiva co-host this circle with a shared passion for creating authentic, supportive spaces where men can connect deeply\u2014offering this gathering simply because they believe in its importance.\n\nThe Men\u2019s Circle provides a safe and nurturing environment where men can share openly, express their feelings, and encourage personal growth\u2014free from societal pressures to be stoic or self-reliant. Through honest sharing and collective support, participants build resilience, deepen self-awareness, and strengthen their sense of identity and purpose.\n\nStructure of the Circle\n\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.\n\nA short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\n\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center. Only the person holding the object may speak, ensuring uninterrupted sharing.\n\nOpen Sharing: Anyone may choose to share while holding the object. Sharing is optional, and passing is always respected.\n\nActive Listening: While one person shares, others listen attentively without speaking, interrupting, or offering advice. The focus is on witnessing and being present.\n\nNo Judgments or Advice: Participants refrain from judging or offering unsolicited advice, creating a safe space for authentic expression.\n\nClosing: The circle may conclude with a group reflection, a moment of gratitude, or a simple acknowledgment of the shared experience.\n\nCircle Agreements\n\nSupportive Environment: We are here to uplift and support one another, fostering trust and brotherhood.\n\nFocus on the Present: Share what's alive for you now, focusing on your emotions and experiences to deepen emotional awareness.\n\nUse \"I\" Statements: Speak from your personal perspective using \"I\" statements to promote authenticity and responsibility. Avoid generalizations like \"we\" or \"us.\"\n\nNo Judgment or fixing: Refrain from judging others sharing or offering unsolicited advice, ensuring a safe and non-critical space.\n\nConfidentiality: What is shared in the circle stays in the circle. You may discuss your own experience outside the group, but keep others' details private.\n\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\n\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\n\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n................................................................................................\n\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week. Events range from creative workshops, wellness courses to entertaining experiences. All within a down-to-earth and welcoming space. Each event wraps up with a plant-based dinner and dessert.\n...............................................................................................\nBhakti Lounge\n1/175 Vivian Street\nWellington\n\nbhaktilounge.org.nz\n\n",

We invite you to THEA 303\u2019s \u2018Carnival of Chaos\u2019 in Studio 77, premiering hybrid works from the House of Echoes (1 & 3 October): The Odyssey, Medea\u202fand\u202fThe Devil is a Lover, and the House of Secrets (2 & 4 October): Rope, The Taming of the Shrew\u202f and\u202f God\u2019s Gift.\n\nEach adaptation has been directed, designed, produced, choreographed and managed by the students.\n\nHouse of Echoes (Season A): Performs on the 1st and the 3rd of October\n\nThe Odyssey \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Homer\u2019s The Odyssey\nOdysseus just wants to get home to his true love, but the journey isn\u2019t exactly smooth. The streets after 2 a.m. and too many beers are alive with obstacles; cops are grumpy, goth girls are tempting, and the help of the Gods is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought. Betrayal, hurt, and anger push her to the edge making her act in ways she never thought she would. \u201cHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned.\u201d\n\nThe Devil is a Lover \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Love Labours Lost\u202fand Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Devil is an Ass\nSatan and two devils, Beelzebub and Pug, make a pact to travel to a 1920s speakeasy on Earth and abstain from corruption for 3 years. As the narrative combines absurdist actions with Shakespearean dialogue, the three devils quickly learn of the difficulties present in avoiding corruption and the effect their devilish meddling has on humanity.\n\nHouse of Secrets (Season B): Performs on the 2nd and 4th of October\n\nRope \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Patrick Hamilton\u2019s\u202fRope\u202f(1929)\nNot a\u202fwhodunnit, but a\u202fhowdoyahideit? Marion and Melanie are sure they\u2019ve committed the perfect murder by killing their friend Norman and hiding his body in a chest, a chest their select group of friends have been invited over to have a murder mystery games night around. It\u2019s foolproof, until the over analytical Constance comes to play\u2026\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew\nIn 1970's Aotearoa, sisters Katherina and Bianca find their love lives complicated by their father's order that one may not pursue romance unless the other follows suit. The sudden appearance of a charming factory owner and friend of Bianca's beau could mark a new hope for the two, but will this lead to an ocean of love or does something far more sinister lurk beneath the surface?\n\nGod\u2019s Gift \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Alchemist\nThe Carnival has come to town in 1615 London.

With composition at the center of his artistry, he can't wait to share the exciting and genuine compositions he has created.\n\nThe rhythm section features Behzad Karakia (drums) and Tyler Diprose (bass), both veterans of performances with many of New Zealand's jazz greats.\n\nOn lead alto sax is James Dawes, recently selected for an international touring band on a year-long cruise. His versatility extends well beyond jazz.\n\nOn keys is Sam Voyle, whose primary instrument is tenor saxophone. Performing with Tommy since their school days, he has built a strong musical bond that has led to major appearances, including the America's Cup main stage and high-profile corporate events.\n\nOn vocals is Melody Lui-Webster, an award-winning singer and accomplished musical theatre performer and actor, with numerous professional stage and television roles.\n\nThank you for watching!",

    "description": "Inner infrastructure for Outer Resilience, In times of polycrisis and uncertainty, more people are coming around to the need not for more information, but for integration and presence.\nThis 90-minute session offers a safe, grounded space to slow down, reconnect with ourselves, and explore the inner terrain of change-making, and of our relational space.\nAs Rumi reminds us: \u201cYesterday I was clever and tried to change the world; today I am wise and am changing myself.\u201d\nBuilding our inner infrastructure - our relationship with self, with our feelings, with others and with nature - is foundational to how we show up in the world.\nWe will begin by discussing research into how distraction or numbing our discomfort is an intelligent and common short-term survival strategy, but in fact is one which limits our long-term capacity to connect, lead and evolve. We will then guide participants in somatic practices to offer accessible ways to reconnect with your agency.\nDuring this session, you will gain tools to increase your inner awareness, expand your bandwidth of awareness, and integrate emotion, sensation, and story. Together we\u2019ll explore the role of perception in our orientation to life and the choices we make, how our narratives can connect us with our agency, the power of curiosity, and dive into how our relational presence can often have more impact than our opinions.\nThis session is an invitation to restore connection, calm, and courage, to become more whole, more fully human, and more ready for what this moment is asking of us.\nAbout your host\nFreda is a curator, engagement practitioner, and connector, who works at the intersection of social change, community-building, and inner development. She is the Founder of the Goodlife Collective, which curates spaces that build connection, wellbeing and collective wisdom.\nDrawing on yoga teaching, somatic practices and adult development, Freda is interested in how we build our inner infrastructure - the capacity to work through discomfort, reconnect with our agency, and bring greater presence to relationships. Her background is in psychology, environmental-science and design, and she loves nerding out on ideas and conversations about unlocking our collective potential.",

As we continue our exploration of Dmitri Shostakovich's journey 50 years after his death, we present his fourth symphony.

This work offers a moment of balance \u2014 a conversation between violin and viola, full of warmth and understanding, reminding us of beauty even in troubled times.\nWith generous support from the Orchestra Wellington Foundation we also reveal a brand-new secret: the world premiere of \"House of the Faun\" by WIlliam Philipson, the 2025 SOUNZ Commission for Orchestra and Sistema Youth Orchestra | Te Tono Mahinga a SOUNZ m\u0101 te R\u0101ngi Puoro me te R\u0101ngi Puoro Taiohi a Sistema.

Night sky in October\n2. Astronomy News\n3. Main talk at 7:50 pm\nTitle: The Science of Science Fiction - Professor Jan Eldridge\nFrom Lost in Space and The Jetsons to Interstellar, the science behind science fiction films and television series is pretty variable, ranging from rubbish to \u2026 quite interesting. Much of it is simply an adjunct to the special effects.The great writers (Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, Robert Heinlein, Ursula le Guin, Richard Morgan, William Gibson, and Neal Stephenson) have expanded our views of what could be. Often their work did not survive contact with Hollywood.\nA few films and TV series are truly memorable: 'Beam me up, Scotty!\u2019; \u2018The red pill\u2019; 'Exterminate!\u2019; and \u2018It\u2019s life, Jim \u2013 but not as we know it.\u2019 But the books are better.\nThis month\u2019s speaker is an esteemed astrophysicist (and neither a replicant nor a sleeve) who can provide a detailed rationale for her views.",

COKI\nFriday 5th September\nSecret Central Wellington Location (TO BE REVEALED ON EVENT DAY)\nPowered by Banshee Soundsystem\n8pm-2am\nR18\nStrictly limited capacity\n\nGet ready Welly, because this one is about to be serious. We have secured the one and only COKI for an intimate warehouse rave at an inner city location.\n\nThis legend of bass needs no introduction, but we\u2019ll give him one anyway. As one half of DIGITAL MYSTIKZ, Coki has made sine waves move like no other, architecting much of the sonic blueprint that modern dubstep has become known for. Alongside Mala, he helped forge the DMZ sound and is now making his way to Wellington for a rare showcase of pure low-frequency warfare. Expect heavyweight pressure, bone-rattling subs, and that unmistakable Coki wobble - this is dubstep in its rawest form.\n\nOn support we have drawn for the best of the best. Opening up proceedings we have BABETECH, champion selector and vibe master. Since murking opening slots for Loefah, Filth and Kahn & Neek as well as spreading the gospel of bass for countless evenings on RadioActive, we can\u2019t think of a better opener for this night.\n\nFollowing that, we have dubstep extraordinaire DUSTY warming things up with his signature and gruelling take on the classic dubstep sound. With releases on Infernal Sounds and Leather Kennel, Dusty has proven himself to be a force to be reckoned with, and is surely one of the most exciting young producers in the game today.\n\nOn closing duties we have the Support Your Local crew going b2b with Young Gho$t to round out the night with a bit of silliness.\n\nWe\u2019ve managed to secure an all-new inner city warehouse location for this one, and its Further Sound on soundsystem duties this time, heating things up with their BANSHEE SOUNDSYSTEM, preparing for only its second full rollout after Cuba Dupa this year.\n\nWe\u2019re unbelievably excited to share this space with you all for a dance and are expecting this to be one for the books.Secure your tickets now and don\u2019t miss out on this momentous and legendary dance music event!\n\nTickets: https://events.humanitix.com/coki-uk-warehouse-rave\n\n",

    "description": "Hands-on Sourdough Workshop, Sourdough for Beginners - $120 (paid via internet banking)\nCome join us for a hands-on, in-person sourdough workshop at Willow Corner Collective headquarters (aka my home)! This workshop is currently the only hands-on sourdough workshop being offered in the Nelson region - I teach and demonstrate to you and then you get to mix and practice on your own dough as we go along.\nWhether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this event is perfect for anyone looking to master the art of making sourdough bread, learning from someone who has 10+ years of experience. Perhaps you've found all the Youtube tutorials and Instagram how-to's overwhelming and are keen to learn via an in-person class. Then this is for you! I've baked hundreds of loaves in the last year alone, sold at a market, and hosted a pop-up shop. However, my passion really lies with teaching others to bake their own sourdough in their own homes, for their own families (or small businesses - one day!).You will be taught, demonstrated to, and then you get to have a go yourself; whilst learning my tips and tricks along the way. Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes and troubleshoot guide\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 6-8pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. If for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though. In extenuating circumstances I may be able to hold your ticket for a future workshop; this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n*Payment to clear in bank account two days after ticket bought, after which time your ticket will be released on to someone else. Please pay immediately upon purchasing ticket.\n**All workshop info you need to know ahead of time is in the confirmation email. Please ensure you read this down to the bottom.\n***I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\n\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight! From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody",

Off the back of a monstrous summer, which saw them play 19 shows up and down the country, the pair have spent most of 2025 in the studio finessing their own brand of audio alchemy and preparing to release their label, also named XCOMMUNICATE.\n\nUsually XCOMMUNICATE is a 6 hour journey though decades and sonic realms, however as Heylady is still recovering from a mighty dose of burnout they\u2019ve roped in a couple of their good friends, who happen to be some of Wellington\u2019s finest, to join them as they lay down four hours of four to the floor.\n\nHalo is a mainstay on Wellington dancefloors and it was a no brainer asking her to be on this lineup. A DJ since 2000, she has played festivals across the country and never fails to rock her slot. Her set at Taniwha\u2019s Den last summer was a big highlight and one of the best of the festival. Halo\u2019s ability to drive forward thinking sound and her clever construction of sets are just two reasons you need to be on her floor.\n\nDJ Coda is the godfather of techno in New Zealand. With a career that spans decades, he isn\u2019t just a DJ but a dedicated promoter and one of the trustees of NZ\u2019s longest running student radio station, Radio Active. Part of the COMMUNICATE family from the get go (and a longtime collaborator of Heylady\u2019s), DJ Coda is a master of his craft and never fails to deliver. Armed with knowledge , taste and a hefty love of Detroit, DJ Coda is the man when it comes to rocking the dance floor.\nFirst release tickets are on sale now, grab yours before they are gone and come and dance the evening away with four of the best. We recommend arrive early so you don\u2019t miss out on any of the sets, they are all going to be killer.\n\nIMPORTANT INFO:\nOur event is a safe space for all. If you or someone you know is feeling unsafe or harassed, please approach one of the DJs or bar staff. If you are behaving badly and impacting others ability to have a good time safely, you will be removed. Please act with respect and care for your fellow attendees at all times, no means no and this goes for conversations as well as more intimate requests.\n\n",

Forster to dazzling life in the Florentine countryside and in the well-appointed homes of the English Edwardian upper classes. A comedy of manners with a quick wit and impeccable comic timing, A Room With A View is also a portrait of the quiet solitude that lies beneath Forster\u2019s characters, and of the need for human connection in a world of rigid convention.\n\nThe young Englishwoman Lucy Honeychurch (played by Helena Bonham Carter), arrives in Florence on a Baedecker-style grand tour with her aunt Charlotte Bartlett (Maggie Smith). Through a series of events involving English expatriates Miss Eleanor Lavish, an unflappable novelist (Judi Dench), and the Emersons, a free-thinking father and son (played by Denholm Elliot and Julian Sands), Lucy\u2019s life is changed forever under a loggia in Florence and in the Tuscan countryside.\n\nIvory\u2019s delicate and playful direction spirits us from an adventure in the back alleys of Florence, lost with Dench and Smith, to the lace-parasolled rigidity of English lawn parties. Shot on location in and around Florence (including unforgettable scenes in the Piazza della Signoria and at Giotto\u2019s frescoes in Santa Croce), A Room With A View made stars not only of Bonham Carter, Day Lewis and Sands, but of the Tuscan landscapes and Puccini arias (as sung by Kiri Te Kanawa) featured throughout.\n\nDirector\nJames Ivory\n\nProducer\nIsmail Merchant\n\nCast\nMaggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Denholm Elliot, Julian Sands",

Imprisoned and shot, he was demonised and censored by dominant media as a subversive and a terrorist.\n\nUltimately, the British and their allies were forced to recognize his legitimacy and negotiate with him - and his party Sinn F\u00e9in - the Irish peace accord known as \u2018The Good Friday Agreement\u2019.\n\nToday, Adams supports the next generations on their peaceful and inclusive path toward Irish unity.\n\nAn intensely private man, protecting his family from the public eye, Adams tell his story for the first time in this eye-opening documentary. Interwoven with his words, a wealth of imagery of what is one of the most documented conflicts of our time gives an insight into Adams\u2019 world - relaxed, informal, and uncensored.\nDirector\nTrisha Ziff",

Imprisoned and shot, he was demonised and censored by dominant media as a subversive and a terrorist.\n\nUltimately, the British and their allies were forced to recognize his legitimacy and negotiate with him - and his party Sinn F\u00e9in - the Irish peace accord known as \u2018The Good Friday Agreement\u2019.\n\nToday, Adams supports the next generations on their peaceful and inclusive path toward Irish unity.\n\nAn intensely private man, protecting his family from the public eye, Adams tell his story for the first time in this eye-opening documentary. Interwoven with his words, a wealth of imagery of what is one of the most documented conflicts of our time gives an insight into Adams\u2019 world - relaxed, informal, and uncensored.\nDirector\nTrisha Ziff",

Davey and Celine have crafted their diverse set around shared love of the blues, a funky groove and beautiful ballads, including originals and covers, also encompassing americana and roots music. You can expect to laugh at their humorous take on some songs, cry at the beautiful ballads they partner on and be toe tapping to their groove. Davey\u2019s acute ear and sound experience allow him to distil the very essence of a song and craft arrangements showcasing the underlying groove inherent in his playing. His voice, reserved, yet soulful and resonant along with his sympathetic guitar chops, elevate Celine\u2019s and other songs to new and sometimes surprising places. Celine provides rhythm guitar and a powerhouse vocal performance, she can own the biggest banger, feel the suffering of a blues standard or dial it right back to expose all the sentiment in a ballad.\n\n",

H\u00e9ctor is not. When she tells them she\u2019s pregnant, her own parents can\u2019t hide their shock \u2013 loving but concerned that their daughter will be unable to tackle the task of motherhood. Will the baby be born deaf? Uncertainty abounds as the due date draws closer, and it\u2019s not just \u00c1ngela\u2019s parents who are beginning to have doubts.\n\nThe foundations for the film\u2019s narrative derive from the personal experiences of first-time actor Miriam Garlo, Libertad\u2019s own sister, as she began to contemplate motherhood as a deaf woman. When surrounded by her other deaf friends, \u00c1ngela is comfortable, alive, vibrant within a community that supports her. Around the local mums in the park, or her husband\u2019s friends, isolation sets in with a painful immediacy that anyone who has ever struggled to understand the language in a foreign country will know all too well. A poignant story bound by the chemistry of its leads, deafness is woven into the film as a lived experience, not a defining label. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

    "description": "Martial Law Film Screening, In remembrance of the victims of human rights violations and extrajudicial killings during the Martial Law in the Philippines, please join us for a free/koha screening of the \"Batas Militar\" documentary in Te Whanganui-a-Tara.\nNOTE: For a list of trigger warnings, please see this document. Since we will be viewing and discussing potentially sensitive topics, the event will have an Open Door Policy, which means that you may leave the venue any time, for any reason, and will not be judged for doing so.\nWHAT IS MARTIAL LAW?\n\"Martial law refers to the replacement of civil rule by military rule. This may be characterized by curfews, the dispensation of military tribunal rulings on civilians, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, which in Latin refers to \u201chaving the body\u201d, is a citizen\u2019s protection against unlawful imprisonment. This is suspended in times of crisis to expedite justice\" (Martial Law Museum).\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY?\nHuman rights violations and extrajudicial killings are still on-going in the Philippines under President Bongbong Marcos, the son of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. who proclaimed Martial Law in 1972, and Vice President Sara Duterte, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte who spearheaded the violent War on Drugs in 2016 (Karapatan).\nWHY WOULD I WANT TO JOIN THE FILM SCREENING?\nThe film screening is for anyone who is keen to learn about the Martial Law Era, wants to share their experience during the Martial Law (or something similar) through group discussion, wants to meet new people, wants to watch a Philippine film/documentary, or just wants to have snacks.\nI WANT TO JOIN BUT I'M FROM T\u0100MAKI MAKAURAU / CHRISTCHURCH / THE PHILIPPINES.\nWe will stream the film through Zoom for viewers outside Te Whanganui-a-Tara, however, there may be internet and other technical difficulties during the event itself. Also please make sure to select the \"Online\" ticket option when RSVPing.\nHOW MUCH IS THE TICKET?\nThe film screening is free but we appreciate koha for the venue/snacks/donations to Philippine non-governmental organisations (NGOs).\nNOTE: This is an LGBTQ+ friendly event.",

You can either select 'Daytime' or 'Evening' which will let you watch three features total. Daytime tickets are from 1:30pm until the dinner break (around 7:00pm). Evening are from the dinner break until the end of the last film.\n\nSurprise we are running a 35mm Mystery Marathon very soon! We have had some exciting news that we cannot share for now but as a result we must move our beautiful 35mm from its usual location into storage for a bit. We are not sure when it will be set back up so to celebrate we are running a marathon of six 35mm features across one Saturday!\n\nWe will kick off the first film at 1:30pm sharp on Saturday and will have a short dinner break after the third film. All going to plan we should be done by around 12:30am.\n\nIn terms of the features, we have films from the 1960s through to the early 2000s with a mix of comedies, sci-fi, horror and cult classics! Granted not all of these films would be considered masterpieces but there is nothing more fun than sitting in a crowd not knowing what could be coming next!\n\nWe will have a snack menu you can pre-order before the first film so aim to arrive around 1:00pm to order. The breaks between films will be very short (probably just enough time for the projectionist to thread up the next film) so make sure you come prepared for back-to-back screenings.\n\nThis event has strictly no digital projection, it\u2019s all film all the time. Now in theory it should all playback without a hitch as we are bringing in some of the best projectionist\u2019s Wellington has. But 35mm is a strange beast that can sometimes throw up the odd issue.\n\nFull marathon tickets (Admit) are $50\nHalf Marathon - Daytime are $30\nHalf Marathon - Evening are $30\n\nSeating is general admission and cinema entrance will be determined by earliest ticket purchase times.",

    "description": "NZIFF: Mirrors No. 3, In the wake of a traumatic incident, a young woman forms a surrogate mother-daughter relationship with her rescuer. As emotional walls come down, doubts arise: is there more to the care offered than simple kindness?\n\nLaura and Betty seem to be poles apart. Laura, a young, city dwelling music student, lives in an apartment with her boyfriend; Betty has an adult son and lives alone in rural Germany. Their lives are thrown together after a car accident leaves Laura in the care of the older woman. Despite ostensible differences, each recognises a familiar melancholy in the other. As a tentative trust grows, the women find something unlocking within themselves, even as complicating factors emerge, in the form of Betty\u2019s opaque family situation.\n\nMaster dramatist Christian Petzold reunites with frequent acting collaborator Paula Beer (Transit, Undine, Afire) and regular DOP Hans Fromm, turning his pen and camera to a smaller scale domestic drama. Mirrors No. 3 (named for a Ravel piano piece played within) makes visual and thematic echoes back to Petzold\u2019s previous work: from extended bike rides down rural lanes (Barbara), to the centrality of a piano (Phoenix), as well as the thread of mysterious tension that underlies them all. The film revels in the messy, stimulating complexities of human relationships, exploring the way that sometimes even questionable motivations can affect positive outcomes. \u2014 Jacob Powell",

Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor.

Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.\nAs Glinda\u2019s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba\u2019s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives.\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

She had just turned 37. Two frenetic months later, she was Prime Minister. Just before the final vote was in, she discovered she was pregnant. She would become only the second head of state in history to give birth while in office.\nArdern quickly became one of the most recognisable leaders in the world. She drew global attention from people craving a sensitive and compassionate approach to the critical issues of our time. In private, she struggled with being a mother and proving herself to a public skeptical of women\u2019s leadership. A series of crises - the Christchurch massacre, pandemic lockdowns, and disinformation-fueled protests outside Parliament - would test that leadership and the feminine touch she brought to it. She resigned from office in January 2023, shocking her supporters and critics alike.\nGoing behind the scenes of her administration and her private life, Prime Minister follows Jacinda for seven years as she is catapulted to the top of New Zealand politics, becomes a feminist political icon, resigns suddenly from office and continues to champion the fight against isolationism, fear, and the distortion of truth. Intimate home footage shot by her husband and audio interviews that Jacinda did while in office give us unparalleled access. Along with in-depth contemporaneous interviews, these form the emotional backbone of the story, giving viewers an unfiltered window into her years in power.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

In the Val-d'Oise region, this community, originally from Turkey and Iraq, has lived since the 1980s in a rhythm marked by weddings, church services, and family meals.\nShaped by the exile of their parents and the persecution their community faced under the Turkish dictatorship and Daesh, S\u00e9miramis nurtures her roots in Assyrian civilization, originating from Mesopotamia. But the puzzle of her history no longer fits together as it once did.\nGradually, the elders are disappearing, taking with them an identity and culture that is 6,000 years old. How can this fracture be repaired, and this heritage preserved? Should they consider staying or returning to their ancestral homeland, now that peace has returned? Can one go back after decades of conflict? Can they rebuild and start anew to live in peace with themselves and others?\n\"Return to Babylon\" is a road movie from Sarcelles to Erbil, following S\u00e9miramis and her family on a journey that leads them to question their future in France and the fate of their community in the Middle East.\nA film by Marie Dault, S\u00e9miramis Ide, and S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nDirected by S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nScreen time: 52-minutes; French and Assyrian with subtitles\nLink to the English-subtitled trailer: https://www.instagram.com/p/DDzsYJzt_B9/\nThe screening event will be held at the Cockburn Street Chapel, 1 Cockburn Street, Kilbirnie, Wellington from 5-7pm.\n\nEntrance is free, but please register to confirm your attendance.\n\nWe welcome koha (donations) which will go towards supporting the ACEYA Wellington Branch's youth-focused activities and events.",

However, their arrogance and lack of communication turns a simple task into the unraveling of their relationship.\nThe film is a comical narrative that pokes fun at miscommunication and microaggression, and ends (literally) in a big mess. I hope audiences are able to share a laugh and see a bit of themselves in the characters: whether it\u2019s the cashier who\u2019s just trying to make it through his shift, or the partner who\u2019s completely had it with their relationship.",

Since we will be viewing and discussing potentially sensitive topics, the event will have an Open Door Policy, which means that you may leave the venue any time, for any reason, and will not be judged for doing so.\nWHAT IS MARTIAL LAW?\n\"Martial law refers to the replacement of civil rule by military rule. This may be characterized by curfews, the dispensation of military tribunal rulings on civilians, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, which in Latin refers to \u201chaving the body\u201d, is a citizen\u2019s protection against unlawful imprisonment. This is suspended in times of crisis to expedite justice\" (Martial Law Museum).\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY?\nHuman rights violations and extrajudicial killings are still on-going in the Philippines under President Bongbong Marcos, the son of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. who proclaimed Martial Law in 1972, and Vice President Sara Duterte, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte who spearheaded the violent War on Drugs in 2016 (Karapatan).\nWHY WOULD I WANT TO JOIN THE FILM SCREENING?\nThe film screening is for anyone who is keen to learn about the Martial Law Era, wants to share their experience during the Martial Law (or something similar) through group discussion, wants to meet new people, wants to watch a Philippine film/documentary, or just wants to have snacks.\nI WANT TO JOIN BUT I'M FROM T\u0100MAKI MAKAURAU / CHRISTCHURCH / THE PHILIPPINES.\nWe will stream the film through Zoom for viewers outside Te Whanganui-a-Tara, however, there may be internet and other technical difficulties during the event itself.

Known for his raw vocals, heartfelt lyrics, and a genre-defying blend of folk, blues, rock, and soul, Shawn has captivated audiences around the globe.\nFollowing a massive international tour and the rise of his hit song \"Through the Valley\" -featured in the critically acclaimed The Last of Us series - Shawn is thrilled to announce his debut run across Aotearoa.\nCatch him live this October for three unforgettable shows:\nWednesday, October 15 - Loons, Christchurch\nThursday, October 16 - San Fran, Wellington\nFriday, October 17 - Double Whammy, Auckland\nTickets are on sale this Friday the 30th of May at 1:00 pm\nPre sale starts tomorrow, Thursday the 29th of May at 1:00 pm\nDon't miss this rare chance to experience the intensity and emotion of Shawn James in an intimate live setting. Tickets are expected to move fast - secure yours now!\n\"Hey there, this is Shawn James. I\u2019ve had way too many writers think they could sum me up & relay what I\u2019m about from an hour long conversation so they could write my \u201cbio\u201d but I\u2019ve had it. Screw that. I\u2019ll tell it in my own words.\nI was born & raised in Chicago, Illinois. I grew up on the south side of the city where I attended a gospel church. I was always around a lot of heartfelt soulful music & hardworking, real, down to earth people. Although I no longer abide by any religion, I value the times I had and how they shaped me to be what I am now. I\u2019ve moved around quite a bit living in all different parts of the US.\nWhile absorbing all sorts of different cultures from here & around the world, I\u2019ve developed my own sound. I started releasing my own music in 2012 and haven\u2019t stopped since. I play a wide range of music from folk to blues, r&b, Gospel to rock, metal & alotta things in between. The main constant amongst all the genres would be that it\u2019s all done with emotion, feeling, heart & a lotta soul. I mean what I say & deeply feel what I play.\nI play covers of songs I dig sometimes and although some people may only know me because of those, I\u2019m hardly just a cover artist.\nIf you come see me play live and expect just one style or aspect of what I do, you may be disappointed to learn that our shows are a roller coaster of emotions, musical styles, intensity & energy. I get bored easily & love to mix things up. Be ready & bring your ear plugs just in case..\nI\u2019ve always been the underdog so to speak since I\u2019ve never had the backing of a large record label, big marketing firm or massive PR company & I truly like it that way. I feel as though I\u2019ve earned what I have through hard work, determination, a good bit of luck & the great relationships with people I\u2019ve made along the way. I\u2019ve learned a lot of lessons the hard way being in this \u201cmusic business industry\u201d and that\u2019s alright by me.\nI\u2019ve seen that with your support (the listeners out there) I can make my wildest dreams come true.\nIf you want to listen to an artist that\u2019s authentic, genuine & original then you\u2019ve come to the right place. I hope you enjoy the music & will join me on this journey that I\u2019m so extremely grateful to be on.\nThank you all so very much.\nLove,\nShawn James\" ",

We will then take you to tour Blue Earth Estate vineyard and olive grove and enjoy a long lunch, accompanied by a glass of wine of course. From there we will take you to the stunning winery at Escarpment, and then to explore the beautiful terraced Craggy Range vineyard and taste their wines among the vines, both of which are not normally open to the public. We will finish the day with some of the other Te Muna producers joining us to share their wines and their stories. It will be a day of discovery - the place, the people and the wines of the beautiful Te Muna Valley.\n\nTickets are strictly limited to 18 people.",

This series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\nEach of the evenings will bring a different electronic vibe, conjured by some of Wellington\u2019s most innovative artists. The series lineup includes:\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\nTickets are available from Wednesday 18 June, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\nAbout the Artists\nLudus\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\nStephen Gallagher\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\nDavid Long\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\nJules Desmond\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\nOghum\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\nJess Chambers\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration.

Upon reaching the gods of Mictl\u00e1n, an offering had to be made to them in order to obtain eternal rest.\n\nWhat to Expect\nClaudio will explain why it is important to celebrate and take the time to honour and remember the members of your family, ancestors and loved ones who have passed away. He will also explain the mysticism and spirituality around the Day of the Dead celebration.\n\nWe\u2019ll also learn how to set up your ofrenda, or altar, and which elements are important for it (as well their meaning).\n\nIt's very common for an ofrenda of the dead to be placed inside Mexican homes, decorated with papel picado, food, traditional sweets, and photos of loved ones. Candles and marigold flowers are also placed as a sign of welcome for our loved ones.\n\nFeel free to bring photos of your beloved ones that have passed away, fruits and flowers for the altar and anything that your beloved ones valued / loved when they were here with us. We will place those on the altar.\n\nThe Evening\u2019s Schedule\nCleansing copal and herbal welcoming.\n\nAn opening ceremony to acknowledge the Tlalmanalli (offering and altar) with the deep sound of the conch shell in the four directions and drums sounds.\n\nHistory of the day of the dead celebration.\n\nExplanation of the altar, and the main elements for an ofrenda.\n\nStorytelling: learn of Mexican legends like Catrinas and Xoloitzcuintle (the Mexican dog that helps the dead to find their way to Mictlan, the Aztec underword).\n\nRemembering and sharing histories about the loved ones that passed away (optional but encouraged)\n\nTraditional Mexican chants for remembering the loved ones\n\nAtole de Chocolate, a traditional prehispanic drink - amazing in flavour, consumed cold or hot\n\nMusic to invoke emotion and imagery of contemplative natural and mystical environments\n\nFinish with a shamanic atmosphere of relaxation and traditional chants.\n\nDetails\nWhen: Saturday 1 November, 7pm -9pm\n\nWhere: AWHI Yoga & Wellbeing - Level 2, 15 Johnston Street, Wellington CBD.\n\nInvestment: $55 (first 5 enrolments - $45!); Children under 16 years old - $35\n\nHaere Mai!\nEveryone is welcome including kids (see special pricing).

The story involves a 'child' (L'enfant) whose awful behaviour brings an unexpected response: first the furniture rebels, the grandfather clock, the broken china cup, then the mathematics tutor and the Princess in the fairy tale book come to life, and eventually all the animals in the garden - squirrels, dragonfly, birds rise up - all of whom have good reason to 'teach the child a lesson'. It's a fabulous journey that we go on with the child who is confronted by all of these and indeed learns...\n\nThis is a project involving the whole of the Classical Performance programme: the voice students sing all the roles, each performing several roles, the NZSM orchestra will play for the performances, and the piano students are taking part as rehearsal pianists (r\u00e9p\u00e9titeurs) and playing in the orchestra.\n\nLighting design by Alex Fisher, set and costumes by Grace O\u2019Brien, assistant director Theresa Hanaray, chorus master Kathryn Mosley, the show has been coordinated by NZSM Head of Classical Voice Jenny Wollerman in collaboration with the Toi Whakaari technical programme staff, graduates, and students",

Data from the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime indicates the demand for drugs is greater than ever, while the supply of drugs knows no bounds. The failure and harm caused by the so called 'War on Drugs' is acknowledged globally and witnessed first hand here in Aotearoa New Zealand.\n\nBack in 2011 a comprehensive review of the MoDA conducted by New Zealand Law Commission recommended the MoDA \u201cshould be repealed and replaced by a new Act \u2026administered by the Ministry of Health\u201d. HRCA wants to see that recommendation enacted.\n\nNew Zealand has a history for bold world leading policy reform: Woman\u2019s Right to Vote; Decriminalisation of Sex Work; National Needle Exchange, Same Sex Marriage and most recently Drug Checking.\n\nThis half day Symposium will provide clear evidence why major law reform is necessary and detail the foundations upon which Aotearoa NZ can once again be innovative and lead the way with new drug laws based on evidence, research and experience -providing a safer environment for future generation.\n\nHarm Reduction Coalition Aotearoa are delighted to have assembled a group of respected independent thinkers with vast experience of drug policy in Aotearoa and beyond, to reflect on the impact of the MoDA and to identify the principles and values needed to underpin new drug laws.\n\nWarren Young: Prof. of Law & Former Deputy President New Zealand Law Commission.\nKirsten Gibson: Chair of Harm Reduction Coalition Aotearoa and Qualitative Researcher.\nFiona Hutton: Associate Prof. Institute of Criminology, Victoria University of Wellington.\nAdam Dorsett: 40 yrs Living/Lived Experience of Prohibited Drug Use, 25yrs in Prison.\nJulian Buchanan: Former UNODC Advisor and Criminology Professor.\n\nNOTE:\nThis event is free and open to the public on a 'first come first served' basis.\nHowever, eventfinda ticket holders will be guaranteed a seat.",

    "description": "Book Launch - Isaac Featherston 'Petatone': A Colonial Life, Join us next month to launch Isaac Featherston 'Petatone': A Colonial Life by John E Martin. The book will be launched by Charlotte MacDonald.\n\nTuesday 7 October, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nAll welcome!\n\n'Existing views of Featherston are fragmentary, negative and not very satisfactory. He was the \u201clittle Doctor\u201d, a single-minded despot wielding tyrannical power and casting an oppressive shadow. As I began to understand more of his life, I realised that there was little appreciation of a man who had contributed so much.\u2019 \u2014John E.Martin\n\nIsaac Featherston was at the heart of some of the most significant developments in New Zealand from the 1840s colonisation by the New Zealand Company to the abolition of the provinces in 1876. A doctor, newspaper editor and politician, he advocated for the provinces against the domination of central government, while also being primarily responsible for the relocation of the capital from Auckland to Wellington in 1865.\n\nKnown amongst M\u0101ori as \u2018Petatone\u2019 and with a reputation for directness and honesty, he was at the very centre of P\u0101keh\u0101\u2013M\u0101ori relations, and in his 1857 official portrait is depicted alongside leading rangatira Te Puni and Wi Tako.\n\nAbout the author: Dr. John E. Martin has researched and written about New Zealand history since the 1980s, teaching in universities and employed as a historian in the public sector. He was parliamentary historian in the 2000s and 2010s. His publications include rural and labour history, the history of science and engineering, and social and political history. His books include The Forgotten Worker (1990), People, Politics and Power Stations (1991 and 1998), Holding the Balance (1996), The House: New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives, 1854\u20132004 (2004), Parliament\u2019s Library (2008), Honouring the Contract (2010), Illuminating Our World (2017), A Colonist\u2019s Gaze (2018) and most recently Empire City: Wellington Becomes the Capital of New Zealand (2022).",

Forged by Black and Latinx trans women and queer communities, it began as a protest against the racism they faced from White counterparts within the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as the transphobia and queerphobia they faced from mainstream society.\nIt is a space held to protect trans women of colour. Therefore, guests and participants of this culture alike must uphold respect and honour for this sacred space and those from which it came from. Homophobia, transphobia, or any discriminatory language and/or beliefs will not be tolerated. Remember to check your privilege at the door.\nLearn more about the culture of Underground Ballroom on Google Arts and Culture.\nBe sure to check out the growing Wellington Ballroom scene and community by following @houseofmarama and @ova_collective on Instagram.

The Magnificat is a world favourite, arguably Bach's best choral piece that has transcended the ages, celebrating Luke's description of Mary's pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, the choir and orchestra perform Ritchie's Then I Understood. When a child of seven to nine, Laura Rangers sketched eight poems centred on summers at Otaki Beach, Ritchie seized the opportunity to add the musical dimension and the result are dual choirs - the Renaissance Singers split - accompanied by the Sinfonia to set off Rangers' delightful insights, so elegantly displayed. The magic that can be childhood.\n\nThe concert has a celebratory theme, it being the 50th anniversary of the choir. Thus the inclusion of Forrest's Three Nocturnes that express the wonderment involved when examining the heavens and the universe full of stars. Throughout this piece the percussionists alone from the Sinfonia provide whimsical accompaniment with a celeste providing the heavenly tones - a hit when played on the last occasion the choir sang the piece.\n\nOpening the concert will be Carl Orff's O Fortuna from his popular Carmina Burana. While O Fortuna laments the role of fate it is set in the larger piece that celebrates life with gusto.\n\nWith the performers in great form (two choristers just back from singing with the world's best choir) this concert will no doubt build the sense of celebration - full of life and wonderment.\n\nGeneral Admission $25, Concession $20, Secondary School $15,\nUnder 13 Free.\n\n",

The first major study of Russia and Southeast Asia since the end of the Cold War, it traces the dramatic shifts in Moscow\u2019s relations with the region since President Vladimir Putin took power in 2000. Dr Storey assesses the legacy of the Soviet Union, charts the evolution of Putin\u2019s foreign policy and identifies the drivers behind the Kremlin\u2019s \u2018Turn to the East\u2019 or Asia pivot. His book also examines Russia\u2019s dialogue partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the development of Moscow\u2019s political, economic and military ties with each of the 11 regional states over the past 25 years. A large part of the book is devoted to Southeast Asia\u2019s responses to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At the end of the talk Dr Storey will also provide an update of Russia-Southeast Asia relations in 2025 and how the region views the on-going Russia-Ukraine War.\nDr Ian Storey is a Senior Fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Singapore. He specializes in regional security issues, focusing on Southeast Asia\u2019s relations with the major powers and maritime security, especially the South China Sea dispute.

    "description": "Treasury Guest Lecture with Michael Keen: IN-PERSON attendance, Join us for our special Fiscal Policy for the Future seminar\nNew Zealand faces significant long-term fiscal challenges, including the rising costs associated with an ageing population, increasing demand for public services, and the need to adapt to a changing global economy. These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand. The Trust was established to support leading tax policy thinking in New Zealand. You can read about the Trust\u2019s work here.\nAbout the presenter\nMichael (Mick) Keen is a former Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, where for over twenty years he played a central role in shaping and delivering IMF policies and advice on tax matters.\nHe has advised finance ministries in all parts of the world, including missions to over forty countries, and led the preparation of influential papers for the G20 and the Executive Board of the IMF.\nBefore joining the Fund, Mick was Professor of Economics at the universities of Essex (UK), Queens (Canada) and Kyoto, and is now Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo.\nMick was the keynote speaker at the 2014 conference on the Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand and has provided peer review for Inland Revenue\u2019s previous Long-Term Insights Briefing.\nMick has jointly authored, with Joel Slemrod, Rebellion, Rascals and Revenue \u2013 an entertaining account of how history illuminates the perennial challenges and timeless principles of taxation\u2014and how the past holds clues to solving the tax problems of today.\nAbout this seminar series\nNew ideas, innovative concepts, research evidence and expert advice are all crucial to stimulate and inform the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis and advice. Our current theme for guest lectures - Fiscal Policy for the Future - explores the role of stabilising, sustainable and effective fiscal policy. Speakers provide insights into how fiscal policy can be designed to support government to meet its current and future objectives and obligations while adapting to changing circumstances and delivering value to the New Zealand public.\nFiscal policy has a stabilising role in helping to smooth the business cycle, while sustainability in fiscal policy is foundational for resilience to both shocks and longstanding challenges, such as climate change, technological advancements, and demographic trends. Ensuring effective and value for money expenditure is important so that fiscal policy contributes to the living standards of New Zealanders, both now and in the future.\nPlease note that the views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series are those of the individual presenters. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the New Zealand Treasury or the New Zealand Government.\nFor updates and our latest research visit: www.treasury.govt.nz\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to be the first to hear about our upcoming events in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series, please SUBSCRIBE to stay up to date.",

We will experiment with a whole new method of mark making, transfer and texture to build skill level and also provide a cross discipline change to invigorate your existing art practice of painting or drawing.\n\nAlso you will be introduced to a progressive evolution development technique for learning and to push yourself into new areas of creativity that can be applied to other art practices and medias.\n\nOne hour lunch - Bring a drink bottle and a packed lunch to enjoy in the historic Inverlochy house or explore the Te Aro cafes.\n\nBasic materials are supplied.\n\nTwo day workshop: Sat 25 - Sun 26 October, 10 am - 4 pm daily.",

It\u2019s also just a different & cool way of meeting new people by getting a bit out of your comfort zone and skipping the small talk!\nJoin us for games, talks, and connections with friends you haven\u2019t met yet. Join if you get annoyed after being asked what you do, where you are from, and how long you have been in Wellington every single time you meet someone. If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll never have to speak in public if you don\u2019t want to!\n\nHOW TO JOIN?\nTake 2 minutes to fill out our form\n\nhttps://luma.com/ftstwellington7\nOur events are limited to 30 handpicked guests to ensure a cozy atmosphere.

Thank you for all.\u201d - Sonya\n\n\u201cF*ck the Small Talk changes the narrative from \"Where are you from?\" to \"When was the last time you laughed uncontrollably?\" and I think that's beautiful.\u201d - Monika\n\n\u201cI loved F*ck the small talk, I was a little bit nervous at first but they are pros at making you feel comfortable with the rest of the group, the activities are really fun and I enjoyed every second (consider that the one who's saying this is very, very shy). Give it a try!\u201d - Brenda\n\n\"it\u2019s a wonderful experience, it\u2019s like being a kid again, when you were at the park, playing with other kids, and just decided you were going to be best friends for the next hours.

But that hour was amazing because you both opened up and trusted each other.\" - Sara\n\n\u201cLively, interesting, introspective, completely open and no judgement.

Just as knots form in the body, impressions and tensions accumulate in the mind. While we can\u2019t change the past, the Bhagavad-gita teaches that we can shape our future\u2014what we choose to cultivate now carries us forward.\nIn this one-hour workshop, we\u2019ll explore how philosophical and spiritual wisdom can help us rise above the tangles of trauma and anxiety. Through practical insights, open discussion, and guidance from the Gita\u2019s philosophy, we\u2019ll look at how to build resilience\u2014not only by steadying the nervous system, but by exploring the deeper self beyond the changing body and mind.\nMeet your host, Sivananda\nSivananda\u2019s background is in both science and music, holding a Master's Degree in Data Science, a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a long history of playing and performing on the double bass. His passion for philosophy, music, good food and community attracted him to the bhakti lifestyle. Having studied and practiced the science of the \u2018self\u2019 for six years now, he thrives on drawing insights from contemporary science and combining it with yoga wisdom to encourage others to explore new perspectives.\n6.15pm Tuesday 28th of October\nEnd the session on a high note with a delicious plant-based dinner, dessert, and good conversation.\nTickets available here~ bit.ly/eventTickets\nBhakti Lounge 1/175 Vivian Street, Te Aro, Wellington. http://www.bhaktilounge.org.nz ",

    "description": "Exploring our shared humanity, Join experienced psychotherapist Rohit Grover for a six-week course that invites you to look beyond the surface of everyday life. In these two-hour sessions, we will explore the core tenets of existential therapy, moving away from the conventional focus on self and hedonism. Instead, we'll grapple with life's big questions:\nWhat does it truly mean to live a value-driven life?\nDo our personal values matter, or is the search for meaning just an illusion?\nWhat is the \"being\" part of \"human being\" all about?\nThrough guided discussions, reflective exercises, and insights from classic existential thinkers, Rohit will help you navigate this profound territory. This isn't about finding easy answers. It's about developing the courage to ask the right questions, to confront the realities of freedom, responsibility, and meaning, and to discover a more authentic way of living.\nThis course is for anyone ready to step off the treadmill and begin a deeper exploration of what it means to be alive. Come and find out what it means to truly exist\nUpon completion of this course, participants will be able to:\nDifferentiate between a life driven by external pressures or fleeting pleasures and one rooted in personal values and authentic meaning.\nIdentify and critically examine the core existential givens of human existence, such as freedom, responsibility, isolation, and the search for meaning.\nArticulate a personal understanding of what it means to \"be\" a human being, moving beyond a purely functional or biological definition.\nArrive at sensing rather than thinking. Sensing this existence, this dance of life. Widen your view of existence.\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".",

That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 05:45 PM\nArrive to Bhakti Lounge\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:45 PM - 07:15 PM\nMen's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\nHost: Andre\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:15 PM - 08:15 PM\nPlant-based dinner and dessert!\n\n\n",

From iconic festival stages like Bluesfest Byron Bay, where he's become a familiar name, to sharing the billing with legends like Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, John Mayer, Paolo Nutini, John Butler Trio, and The Teskey Brothers; Kirk's artistic prowess is in esteemed company. Moreover, he's also had the honour of opening for household names such as blues maestro Joe Bonamassa, soul sensation Allen Stone, and the indomitable Beth Hart; further solidifying his place in the landscape of contemporary music. This remarkable journey is a testament to Kirk's unmatched talent and ability to connect with audiences across genres and generations.\n\n",

    "description": "Men's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection, Men's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\nMen\u2019s Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\n\nIn a world where men are often expected to have everything figured out, this gathering offers a space to be genuine, not perfect.\n\nThis is a free event, with an optional plant-based dinner available for $15. While there\u2019s no obligation to stay for dinner, sharing a meal together offers a meaningful way to strengthen connections. Andre and Sri Jiva co-host this circle with a shared passion for creating authentic, supportive spaces where men can connect deeply\u2014offering this gathering simply because they believe in its importance.\n\nThe Men\u2019s Circle provides a safe and nurturing environment where men can share openly, express their feelings, and encourage personal growth\u2014free from societal pressures to be stoic or self-reliant. Through honest sharing and collective support, participants build resilience, deepen self-awareness, and strengthen their sense of identity and purpose.\n\nStructure of the Circle\n\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.\n\nA short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\n\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center. Only the person holding the object may speak, ensuring uninterrupted sharing.\n\nOpen Sharing: Anyone may choose to share while holding the object. Sharing is optional, and passing is always respected.\n\nActive Listening: While one person shares, others listen attentively without speaking, interrupting, or offering advice. The focus is on witnessing and being present.\n\nNo Judgments or Advice: Participants refrain from judging or offering unsolicited advice, creating a safe space for authentic expression.\n\nClosing: The circle may conclude with a group reflection, a moment of gratitude, or a simple acknowledgment of the shared experience.\n\nCircle Agreements\n\nSupportive Environment: We are here to uplift and support one another, fostering trust and brotherhood.\n\nFocus on the Present: Share what's alive for you now, focusing on your emotions and experiences to deepen emotional awareness.\n\nUse \"I\" Statements: Speak from your personal perspective using \"I\" statements to promote authenticity and responsibility. Avoid generalizations like \"we\" or \"us.\"\n\nNo Judgment or fixing: Refrain from judging others sharing or offering unsolicited advice, ensuring a safe and non-critical space.\n\nConfidentiality: What is shared in the circle stays in the circle. You may discuss your own experience outside the group, but keep others' details private.\n\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\n\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay.

He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\n\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n................................................................................................\n\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

    "description": "Teaching Well - A supportive school for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), Growing attention to staff wellbeing has resulted in many workplace mental wellbeing initiatives. Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme.

    "description": "Teaching Well - Supportive schools for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), With the growing emphasis on staff wellbeing there is a plethora of workplace mental wellbeing programmes on offer. However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages. In fact, the staff consultation is, in itself, is a wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops.

They change fast, they don\u2019t always play nice, and they\u2019ve caught out even the most experienced skippers. Each year, we see serious incidents and tragedies happening on our bars, so it\u2019s super important to know your stuff before you head out.\nThat\u2019s where we come in. Join us at Manawatu Marine Boating Club for a free and relaxed seminar. You\u2019ll hear straight from local Coastguard skippers and boating legends who\u2019ll share their real-world tips, local knowledge, and a few stories from the water.\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover (and chat about):\n\nUnderstanding the local features of your bar\nReading and interpreting the conditions when planning a trip\nGetting your boat and your crew bar crossing ready\nHow to handle your boat while crossing\nHow to do a bar crossing report (and why it\u2019s worth it)\nWhat to do if things go pear-shaped\nIt\u2019s interactive \u2013 so bring your questions, share your own experiences, and have a yarn with others in the boating community.\nBring your mates too \u2013 whether they\u2019re brand new to boating or have been around since the days of paper charts and handheld compasses, there\u2019s something in here that could save a trip\u2026 or a life.\n Why it matters:\nIn 2024, 23% of craft-related drownings happened during bar crossings.\n5 lives were lost due to capsizing while crossing a bar.\nOlder blokes are still the most at-risk \u2013 but everyone can make safer choices with the right knowledge (and a lifejacket on).",

Max 5 people.\nCome and have a go at wet-plate collodion photography, using authentic materials to produce your own heirloom image as were made 170 years ago. This almost lost art produces one-of-a-kind images on tin or glass plates, which you create and have an image you\u2019ve crafted to take away.\n\nBrian Scadden will be your instructor for this workshop. Brain has been passionate about photography for over 40 years, beginning his career at the National Film Unit in the 1970s before joining Park Road Post Production as Head of Laboratory, Head of Picture, and Restoration Manager. His work in film sparked an interest in early photographic techniques, prompting him to master wet-plate collodion photography. In 2006, he was invited to assist leading wet-plate experts in the USA and has since taught many New Zealanders this challenging process. Jane, who attended Brian\u2019s workshop in 2014, later married him in 2019 and completed a photographic project in Carterton in 2016.\nAlthough Brian retired in 2015, he returned for short-term assignments at Park Road Post and part-time work at Archive NZ, supporting film archiving until mid-2023. Both Brian and Jane continue to shoot with 35mm and 120mm film using vintage cameras from their collection.\n\nNOTE: Link for booking tickets coming soon.\n\nEmail:\nwww.greytownarttown.com\n\n",

Walk through the gates of Rathkeale College on 1st November and be welcomed by a diverse range of colourful stalls, the aroma of freshy cooked food and plenty of festive inspiration.\n\nNow in its 22nd year, the Christmas F\u00eate has become a must-do event on the Wairarapa spring calendar. Stallholders travel from around the North Island to sell their wares and offer Christmas shoppers loads of inspiration. From festive decorations, clothing, arts and crafts, to flowers, toys and plants \u2013 there is something for everyone.\n\nGourmet food is always a highlight at the F\u00eate - think freshly made gourmet burgers, lamb & mint sausages, wraps, curry, salads, and the ever-popular berries & ice-cream - there is always a huge variety of flavours to tempt the taste buds. Devonshire Teas and home baking served in the Rathkeale Homestead rose garden is a time-honoured tradition while refreshing cold drinks can be sipped on as visitors listen to live music performed by students at various times throughout the day. The popular Christmas cake stall features again this year - but visitors are encouraged to get in early as the cakes often sell out by midday.\n\nThe beauty of this F\u00eate is that it\u2019s a day out for the whole family. In addition to the 120 plus stalls, there is plenty to entertain the children including facepainting and magic shows throughout the day.\n\nVisitors can also explore the beautiful, expansive grounds of Rathkeale College including the school gardens designed by Alfred Buxton, the Greek Amphitheatre and the 3km eco-trail which weaves through large stands of native trees, including ancient kahikatea.\n\nEftpos is available, but we strongly recommend that visitors bring cash.\n\nKoha/gold coin entry.\nRathkeale College is a five-minute drive north of Masterton in the Wairarapa.",

It brings the sewing community together to share stashes, stories and delight in our mutual love of textiles.\nFabric-a-brac is volunteer-run, and is a fundraiser for hospice - in Wellington this is Mary Potter Hospice. All profits from this event are donated to their work. We've raised $80,000 since our first event in 2009.\nSelling fabric\nIf you have a stash you'd like to sell, you can come and take a stall. You pay a stallholder fee (which goes to Hospice) but anything you make on the day is yours to keep. Stalls are allocated via a ballot, which will take place closer to the time. Go to our website to find the form. Closes mid August.\n\nIf you have fabric, haberdashery or patterns you'd like to move on, but don't want to have a table, you can donate items. This will all go onto the hospice table on the day, and all profits will go to their wonderful work.\nFabric donation points\n- Made Marion\n- Mary Potter Hospice - you can take donations to the Mary Potter Hospice in Mein St, Newtown\n\nPop-up cafe\nThe fabulous cafe is back with all of its gorgeous volunteers and fab food. There will be tea, coffee and sweet treats for sale, so you can sit down and chat over your new projects and fabric purchases. All proceeds from the cafe also go to Hospice.\nBuying fabric\nBring cash - most stallholders and the cafe will be selling by cash only.\nWe look forward to seeing our fabulous fabric and sewing community soon!\n*Saturday September 20 2025\n*St Anne's Parish Hall, Emmett Street, Newtown, Wellington",

Fronted by the enigmatic Ruth Carr, her coy persona ignites while bandmates Ryan Beehre and Paul Dodge forge rib-rattling beats around her.\nTheir debut album, The 88, released in 2003, achieved gold status in New Zealand, quickly followed up by the 'I Hate Guns' EP.\nOver the following decade, the trio toured their synths and samplers from Helsinki to Hanoi crafting their own refreshing sound \u2013 storming The Crystal Method's club night in LA, the FabricLive birthday bash in London, and headlining the Hanoi Music Festival in Vietnam. Along with festivals and shows up and down Aotearoa.\nHaving been retired since 2014, we\u2019re excited to announce that Minuit are back onstage for a limited number of reunion shows.\nThese reunion performances will pay tribute to classic tunes from all four albums 'The Boy with the Aubergine Hair', 'Except You', 'Fuji', 'Menace', \u2018Aotearoa\u2019, \u2018I Hate Guns\u2019, \u2018A Room Full of Cute\u2019, 'Last Night You Saw This Band', \u201825 Bucks\u2019 \u2013 everything gets a look in, plus a couple of other surprises.\nThe show will be supported by Western Haikus and JOLA BURNS.\nMinuit has a heart.

Amy Marguerite (over under fed), Sophie van Waardenberg (No Good), and Emma Barnes (IF WE KNEW HOW TO WE WOULD) talk with Anna Jackson about the conditionality of rapture, the loveliness of loneliness, the difficulty of living in a hungry body, how it has felt to keep writing through a pandemic, heart-break and grief, and why it matters to make space for metaphor and memory, for sparrows and bees and a guinea-pig, eating a dandelion, its mouth full of gold.\nWriters on Mondays is presented by the International Institute of Modern Letters and Te Papa Tongarewa. The 2025 series will run from 12.15\u20141.15 pm each Monday from 7 July to 29 September at Te Papa Tongarewa and Circa Theatre, with two special evening sessions at Meow.

Instead of being talked at with boring slides, you\u2019ll step into three carefully designed games that let you actually practice leadership.\nYou\u2019ll be experimenting, problem-solving, laughing (a lot), and walking away with insights that stick because you\u2019ve lived them, not just heard them.\nThis isn\u2019t theory. It\u2019s leadership in action.\nLearn more at our website.\nHow it works\nThe day is made up of three 2-hour games. You can book individual sessions ($99 each), or join us for the full day ($297) to play all three and unlock The Leadership Playbook - a bonus 60-minute facilitated debrief where we connect the dots and help you take away a clear set of personal leadership shifts.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s on in Wellington:\nThe Moonlit Market (8:30\u201310:30am)\nPitch, trade, and negotiate under pressure. Build agility, creativity, and bold decision-making in a playful, high-energy marketplace.\nThe Broken Bridge (11:00am\u20131:00pm)\nA fantasy quest to practice difficult conversations. Explore courage, clarity, and how you show up when the stakes feel high.\nThe Inner Tides (1:45\u20133:45pm)\nUse the Emotional Culture Deck in a role-playing game to strengthen emotional awareness, resilience, and confidence in leading with empathy.\nThe Leadership Playbook (4:00\u20135:00pm)\nAvailable only with a full-day pass. A guided reflection session to connect your learning, extract insights, and leave with a practical playbook you can use back at work.\nWhy you should join\nPractical skills, not theory - you\u2019ll walk away with tools and insights you can use immediately.\nSafe practice, real challenges - rehearse tough moments without real-world consequences.\nEnergy + engagement - no sitting back, you\u2019ll be on your feet, in the mix, learning by doing.\nUnique approach - game-based leadership development you won\u2019t find anywhere else in NZ.\nWhether you\u2019re a leader, facilitator, HR/People professional, or just someone curious about growing your leadership edge - this day is designed for you.\nTickets\nIndividual game session: $99\nFull day pass (all 3 games + Leadership Playbook debrief): $297\n\ud83d\udc49 Ready to roll the dice on your leadership?\n\nSpots are limited - grab your ticket today.",

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "NZIFF: Sex, Returning from last year\u2019s Festival to screen alongside the rest of his Sex Dreams Love trilogy, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s comic drama takes a candid and refreshing look at modern gender roles.\n\nThere has hardly been any investigation on contemporary male identity and sexuality as candid, insightful and hilarious as Norwegian auteur Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Sex. After winning all major laurels in Nordic cinema with his impressive fresco Beware of Children (2019), the acclaimed director and author embarkson an Oslo-set trilogy simply called Sex Dreams Love.\n\nThe first instalment opens on one of the most tantalising and unexpected preludes in recent cinema. Two chimney sweeps frankly open up to each other on a coffee break in their office: the first reveals that he dreamt of being intensely looked at by none other than David Bowie, who was inspecting him as if he was a woman; the other confesses that he recently accepted the sexual advances of a male customer who asked him to have sex with him. But both men are \u201cstraight\u201d and married to women. Here, the deft tone of the film and Haugerud\u2019s rules of the game are immediately set.\n\nA fervent admirer of Eric Rohmer\u2019s thickly scripted skirmishes of love and ethics, the Norwegian writer-director infuses irony, depth and compassion in each of his elegantly composed tableaux depicting how the two men cope with the turmoil these experiences bring to their relationships with their partners and family, but most of all with themselves. Featuring some of the brightest and funniest dialogues of 2024, Sex is a real eye-opener. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

The bill set out to decriminalise homosexual activity between consenting adults and make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t the first attempt at homosexual law reform. Join us on this special 90-minute free walk tour to celebrate the people and movements that fought for a brighter future for rainbow communities.\n\nOur journey begins at the location of the first public meeting in New Zealand, advocating for homosexual law reform in 1967. This was two years before the Stonewall uprising in the U.S. which went on to ignite Gay Liberation around the world.\n\nThe tour ends at Parliament, where we honour the Members of Parliament who have championed equality over the last five decades.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll reflect on some of the difficult realities rainbow communities have faced, from the injustices of the legal system, to the stances of the medical profession, churches and the military. As the late activist Ralph Knowles recalls, \u201cAs far as medicine was concerned, it was sick. As far as the law was concerned, it was a crime. As far as the church was concerned, it was a sin.\u201d\n\nThough at times the stories are challenging, this walk tour is ultimately uplifting, as we pay tribute to our amazing rainbow kaumatua and allies who led the way.\n\nCOST: Free, but please register so we can manage the number of walkers: https://walktoursnz.wordpress.com/book/\n\nDATE/TIME: 1pm, Sunday 19th October 2025\n\nSTARTS: meet at the rugby sculpture, Jack Ilott Green, corner of Harris Street & Jervois Quay (just by Civic Square)\n\nENDS: Parliament grounds\n\nDURATION: 1 hour 30mins\n\nACCESSIBILITY: the tour is on flat public footpaths, with a light incline as we enter Parliament grounds. Tours are limited to approximately 20 walkers.\n\nThis tour is part of the amazing Wellington Heritage Festival - https://wellingtonheritagefestival.co.nz\n\n",

She and her family ultimately escaped to the Netherlands.\nBrigitte Schiffer, a young composer who completed her doctorate in Berlin before fleeing the Nazis to Egypt, where she became the director of the Higher Music Education Institute for women.\nThe Al Kuwaiti brothers, Jewish pioneers of modern Iraqi music, survived the Farhud, a devastating pogrom inspired by Nazi ideology that targeted Baghdad's Jewish population on June 1-2, 1941, coinciding with the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. Despite their legacy resonating across the Middle East through radio, their contributions were erased from Iraqi history.\nFerdinand Adler, a Hungarian Jewish violinist who miraculously escaped from the Dachau concentration camp, to Shanghai.\n Join us for this important event as we mourn the lives lost and celebrate the resilience of the human spirit. We look forward to welcoming you.\n Details:\nWellington: Sunday, 9 November 2025\nAuckland: Monday, 10 November 2025\nDoors Open: 6:00 PM\nConcert Begins: 6:45 PM\nLocation: To Be Announced\n Please RSVP by Monday, 3 November 2025, to let us know if you can join us.",

    "description": "Professor Brian Cox: Emergence, It\u2019s a stage show that covers vast rivers of galaxies in the cosmos, the ecosystems of Earth, and the structure of the human brain. Emergence is the latest show by English physicist, presenter, and personality Professor Brian Cox. He takes to the stage at TSB Arena to contemplate the dazzling complexity of the universe and how it\u2019s built on profoundly simple principles. \nEmergence is also a scientific history of 400 years of human discovery. How did we come to understand so much about the cosmos? Guided by mathematics, curiosity, and an aesthetic sense of symmetry, our species has begun to read the story of the Universe. We\u2019ve started to carry our spacecraft to the edge of the solar system and outwards to the stars. Brian\u2019s engaging style makes these questions come to life. The audience will be left awestruck and thrilled as the show covers vast topics in an accessible way. \nBrian has appeared in many landmark science programs for BBC radio and television over the last 15 years, from the Peabody Award-winning Wonders of the Solar System to the worldwide hit series The Planets. His previous touring show, Horizons, was performed to nearly half a million people across the world.",

These are lives shaped by love and politics, motherhood and memory, constraint and defiance.\nFrom girls raised in the garden of Plunket founder Truby King, to a queer university student at a mid-2000s Berlin rave, to a mother facing the cost of her son\u2019s climate rebellion, the women of All Her Lives are complex, resilient and deeply human. Shadowing their stories is the early feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, whose journey of grief and revolution will become a vessel for what endures \u2013 and for finding hope.\nVast and intimate, All Her Lives explores the layered selfhood of women \u2013 all that they inherit, sacrifice, imagine and carry forward \u2013 and the power found in unravelling and reweaving those selves on their own terms.\n'A wonderful collection that swims in and out of women's lives across time, exploring the struggle for freedom and love. I'll be thinking about it for a long time - a book of quiet force.' \u2014Emily Perkins, author of Lioness\nIngrid Horrocks\u2019s books include the memoir Where We Swim (2021), a literary history, Women Wanderers and the Writing of Mobility (2017), and two collections of poetry. Her writing has appeared in Lithub, The Ninth Letter, The Sydney Review of Books, The Spinoff, Landfall, and the Guardian. In 2024 she was the Kaituhi Tar\u0101whare CNZ Writer in Residence at the International Institute of Modern Letters, and in 2025 she was awarded the Michael King Writers Centre Australian Residency at Varuna.

    "description": "Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour, Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour\nIndie-Folk Artist Colette Rivers and her band will be performing her intimate new album, The Backyard Wonder.\n\nIndependent artist Colette Rivers is releasing her second full-length album, The Backyard Wonder, an intimate exploration of healing, change, and the quiet beauty of ordinary moments.\n\nThis album holds special meaning for Rivers: after being diagnosed with cancer in July 2023, her planned sophomore release had to take a back seat to recovery. But when the cancer returned in early 2025, she felt compelled to finish and release the album, not just as a legacy project, also as a celebration after hard times, with a focus on how \u201cyou can find the wonder in life, even in your backyard.\u201d\n\nA lifelong creative, Rivers records, mixes, and produces in her home studio in Masterton, and plays every instrument heard on The Backyard Wonder. Her debut album, Memory Lake (2020), was shaped by early years spent in the US, and her move to Taup\u014d at age 11; this was followed by a nationwide tour. Now based in the Wairarapa and working as a secondary school drama teacher, Rivers continues to move between solo performance and full band sets, while staying rooted in the acoustic traditions that define her sound.\n\nWith her right arm partially paralysed following recent treatment, Rivers has gathered a group of close friends to help bring the songs of The Backyard Wonder to life (especially its intricate fingerpicking parts) for a run of live shows. She\u2019ll be touring the Wellington and Wairarapa regions from August through October, finishing with a set at the Wellington Folk Festival.\n\nFor updates, and behind-the-scenes glimpses, visit www.coletteriversmusic.com or follow @colettemusic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nOpening for Rivers are artists:\n\nPhil Masters\nPhil Lively-Masters is an experienced, well travelled singer songwriter who specialises in writing the sort of Sun Kissed West Coast Laurel Canyon Americana that made Neil Young, Stephen Stills and the Byrds famous. With a powerful, honey soaked voice that has won praise and support slots from legendary American country rock pioneers like The Jayhawks and original cosmic cowboy Steve Young, Phil has 20 years worth of road worn original songs to pull on, including tracks from the critically acclaimed CANYON RYDE album 'Free To Be' and some choice country rock covers to weave a spell on any listener.\n\nSaali Marks\nA singer, songwriter, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, Saali Marks hails originally from the\nSouth Island, but has made Wairarapa his home for the last 20 years, where he lives on a farm\nwith his family and teaches music at Kuranui College.\nSaali has played in numerous bands over the years, in a wide range of styles from proto-punk\nto psychedelic dub, covers, originals and fully improvised music with no discernible genre, on\nstages throughout Aotearoa since 1991. Currently he fronts the Wellington ska band Battleska\nGalactica.\nThroughout and alongside it all Saali has indulged his love for songwriting and solo\nperforming, developing a unique style, rooted in folk and blues, and inspired by greats from\nacross the decades. A skilled guitarist, Saali rarely plays straight ahead chords, and an\neducation in jazz has informed his ear for harmony, the beauty of dissonance, tension and\nresolution, with unconventional song structures, alternate tunings and intriguing melodies.\nAlthough not adverse to penning the odd love song, most of Saali\u2019s lyrics tend to focus on\nother aspects of the human condition, from religion and politics to our relationships with the\nenvironment and our own minds.\n\n",

    "description": "Cowboy Dan: Dreams That Feel Like Falling Aotearoa Album Tour - Te Whanganui-a-Tara / Wellington, Cowboy Dan: Dreams That Feel Like Falling Aotearoa Album Tour - Te Whanganui-a-Tara / Wellington\nT\u0101maki Makaurau jangle rockers Cowboy Dan are releasing their debut full length album; Dreams That Feel Like Falling. The album drops 19 September on streaming & vinyl.\n\nNever overblown or overproduced, Dreams That Feel Like Falling is direct and intimate. 11 tracks of warmth, sincerity and brashness that strike a balance of breeze and overdrive.\n\nTo celebrate the release, Cowboy Dan are heading out for a run of shows throughout Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui in September and October.\n\nThis Te Whanganui-a-Tara will be the second outing in the capital for Cowboy Dan, who are delighted to bring Echo Children along for the ride from T\u0101maki to share their special tunes and infectous harmoines, along with Te Whanganui-a-Tara local legends Search For Yeti...STACKED!\n\nOnce aptly described as The Bats on the right amount of Red Bull, Cowboy Dan has been treating audiences across the motu to energetic, emotionally charged tunes since 2015. Their live shows have consistently delivered good times to fans and new friends alike.\n\nOff the back of two delightful EPs: We Will Hesitate, When We Eventually Wait (2017, Mixed by Jonathan Pearce); Sentimental Now That We're Leaving (2021, Mixed by Rohan Evans), the debut LP, Dreams That Feel Like Falling, is a continuation and a few steps forward, showcasing the bands expansive sonic pallet, with a mix of distortion, introspection, heart and bite.\n\nSearch For Yeti draws from a deep range of influences to create a sound that achieves the difficult feat of being hugely atmospheric and diverse while also being hook laden. This is an act that captures people with their onstage energy \u2014 and gets them talking afterwards about the songs that they just heard.\n\nFollowing in the long tradition of innovative Aotearoa indie bands, Echo Children craft a distinctive sound by melding psychedelic pop harmonies with sharp alt-country songwriting.\n\nGather your pals and get ready for good times! A thursday, sure, but what a chance to digest some upbeat goodness hailing from the big smoke and with some local goodness to boot.\n\n",

    "description": "NZIFF: Dreams (Sex Love), A teenage girl recounts her crush for her teacher through the pages of a memoir. The winner of the Golden Bear 2025 is a lucid and tender chronicle of the unforgettable experience of first love.\n\nOriginally intended as the second chapter in his trilogy and released in Norway as such, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Dreams ended up premiering internationally as the last. But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Keith\u2019s fresh take on this beloved classic draws from both Grieg\u2019s original piano score and the composer\u2019s own string arrangement, distilling the spirit of the suite into a sparkling new form for reed quintet.\n\nTaking the stage is marimba specialist Naoto Segawa, Principal Percussionist of Orchestra Wellington. He is joined by fellow OW musicians and NZSO Sub-principal Sam Rich, who brings a vibrant palette of exotic percussion to the performance.",

Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology.\n\n",

It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology.\n\n",

He\u2019ll be celebrating 10 years since his acclaimed album release \u2018Blues in Full swing\u2019 and the recent release of his new single \u2018Gumption\u2019\nLi\u2019l Chuck will present his full one man band plus a selection of his cranky home made instruments and Diddley bows and offering audiences the amazing opportunity to jam, skiffle and learn about his old time homemade music.\nHaving spent a lifetime rummaging through the drawers of 1930's - 50's music, Chuck\u2019s songs are inspired by the sounds of the era - Blues, Early Jazz, Western Swing, Ragtime etc. and are uniquely presented in the style of street performers from those glory days. Sticking to the traditional one man band format, Chuck plays all the instruments simultaneously.\nCaptivating storytelling intertwines effortlessly with heart stopping harmonica. Multiple guitar styles are underpinned by his left and right feet frantically pounding the kick and hi hat. The listener is left simply wondering, \"How the hell does he do that\"?\nOriginally hailing from the UK, Li\u2019l Chuck has been stomping his music in NZ since 2003.\nLi'l Chuck has performed at many high profile events around New Zealand including opening for American legend Jimmy Buffet, Bluesman Jerron 'Blind Boy' Paxton and The Topp Twins, and festivals including Blues on Broadbeach, Gold Coast Australia, Dunedin and Wanaka Arts festivals, The Great Kiwi Beer festival, Canterbury folk festival and many more.\nUp to 2025, He has recorded 5 solo one man band records to great acclaim by international Blues publications.\nHis 2017 album Utility Blues hit No\u20196 on the official NZ albums chart & has twice been the feature artist on Jesse Mulligan's Radio New Zealand\u2019s Friday live.\nIn an age where we are rushing around at breakneck speed, where everything is instant, sugar coated, airbrushed and overly polished, Li\u2019l Chuck brings us down to earth with some organic, all natural, whole grain, naked goodness.\nDoors open 7pm for a 7.30pm start.",

    "description": "Film screening: GAGA, Film screening: GAGA\nJoin us for a special screening of the 2022 Taiwanese comedy-drama film GAGA, featuring a Q&A with the award-winning Director, Laha Mebow\n\nAbout this Event\n\nGaga\u300a\u54c8\u52c7\u5bb6\u300b(2022)\nDirected by Laha Mebow 112 mins, Mandarin/Atayal/Taiwanese, English subtitles\nAmong the Atayal indigenous people of Taiwan, gaga is the traditional law and custom, the way of living with the land and organising society, the source of values. When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience. As she continues to evolve as an artist, Araiyah\u2019s music promises to touch the hearts of many, leaving a lasting impact on all who have the privilege of listening.\n\nAraiyah will be accompanied by guitarist Izzy and Laura Chester-Murphy on percussion.\n\nRain and the Urban Bohemians:\n\nFormed around the music of singer-songwriter Cathy Elizabeth aka Rain, supported by her band of Urban Bohemians, this group has been able to weave together many different influences and styles to create something quite unique and beautiful.\n\nPeppered with contemplations of our existence and the fleetingness of time, Rain & the UBs bring the magic with a folk-rock edge and an alluring authenticity at its centre. Spiritual undertones and overtones give way to an uplifting joyfulness, of triumph over difficulties and life lessons learned and expressed through music.\n\nWith Cathy Elizabeth on vocals & acoustic guitar, Chris Ewers on bass, Murray James on drums and Izzy and Dion on guitars, these guys have got the goods and are ready to deliver!\n\nSo come along and allow yourself to be immersed and transported, moved and entertained. It\u2019s going to be a very special night all round!\n\n",

    "description": "TARN PK - LIVE AT MOON, TARN PK - LIVE AT MOON\n~ DON'T GET F.O.M.O ~\n\nTarn PK is bringing his new EP \u2019F.O.M.O\u2019 to live audiences in Wellington on the 14th of September 6pm at MOON, with support from Sig Wilder & Friends and Josh Glennie.\n\nWith his newly formed 3 piece band, they\u2019re stripping his sound down to the essentials; funky drum breaks, soaring synths and crunchy guitars, bringing a whole new dimension to the sound from the EP.\n\nF.O.M.O, is a reflection on burnout, ambition, and identity in a digitally overwhelmed world. It draws inspiration from urban isolation and the weight of expectations. Tracks from the EP have landed on major Spotify and Apple playlists. Reflecting the office environment, familiar to many, this performance will bring to life the themes from the EP in a host of ways.\n\nWith over 2.2 million streams across platforms and 1.8 million on Spotify alone, his impact is growing. Releases have landed on global and regional editorial playlists. His EPs\u2014Fantasy, Monarch, SugarCoated and now F.O.M.O \u2014have consistently showcased his range and evolution as an artist.\n\nSig Wilder & Friends blend kiwi authenticity with American grit, bringing you a well-worn handwritten journal of lived experiences rendered through metaphor, poetic prose, and the stylistic conventions of folk, alt-country and late-night heartbreak radio.\n\nJosh Glennie is a soulful singer/songwriter based in Wellington, New Zealand. He's made a name for himself playing in bands around Wellington and is now striking out with his own solo material. Together with Tarn, they have produced a new EP of songs that cut to the bone, focused around acoustic guitar and Josh's striking vocals. His New EP is expected late 2025/early 2026.\n\n",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019.

    "description": "Inner infrastructure for Outer Resilience, In times of polycrisis and uncertainty, more people are coming around to the need not for more information, but for integration and presence.\nThis 90-minute session offers a safe, grounded space to slow down, reconnect with ourselves, and explore the inner terrain of change-making, and of our relational space.\nAs Rumi reminds us: \u201cYesterday I was clever and tried to change the world; today I am wise and am changing myself.\u201d\nBuilding our inner infrastructure - our relationship with self, with our feelings, with others and with nature - is foundational to how we show up in the world.\nWe will begin by discussing research into how distraction or numbing our discomfort is an intelligent and common short-term survival strategy, but in fact is one which limits our long-term capacity to connect, lead and evolve. We will then guide participants in somatic practices to offer accessible ways to reconnect with your agency.\nDuring this session, you will gain tools to increase your inner awareness, expand your bandwidth of awareness, and integrate emotion, sensation, and story. Together we\u2019ll explore the role of perception in our orientation to life and the choices we make, how our narratives can connect us with our agency, the power of curiosity, and dive into how our relational presence can often have more impact than our opinions.\nThis session is an invitation to restore connection, calm, and courage, to become more whole, more fully human, and more ready for what this moment is asking of us.\nAbout your host\nFreda is a curator, engagement practitioner, and connector, who works at the intersection of social change, community-building, and inner development. She is the Founder of the Goodlife Collective, which curates spaces that build connection, wellbeing and collective wisdom.\nDrawing on yoga teaching, somatic practices and adult development, Freda is interested in how we build our inner infrastructure - the capacity to work through discomfort, reconnect with our agency, and bring greater presence to relationships. Her background is in psychology, environmental-science and design, and she loves nerding out on ideas and conversations about unlocking our collective potential.",

This immersive sound journey offers a deeply restorative experience that invites you to settle into stillness, reconnect with the heart, and explore a sense of inner spaciousness through vibration and tone.\nClaudio skilfully layers the sounds of gongs, crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, Native American flutes, and other traditional instruments, enhanced through high-quality audio equipment so the sound can be both heard and felt throughout your body.\nHarmonic sound and vibration offer the nervous system a chance to truly rest. In this state of relaxation, the thinking mind softens, and we find connection to citta \u2014 the heart-mind. From this place, silence arises naturally through the vehicle of sound.\nThis experience is open to everyone. No previous yoga or meditation practice is needed.\n\nWhat to bring:\nYou are welcome to bring your own yoga mat, though studio mats are also available. We will provide bolsters, blankets, and eye pillows for your comfort.\n\nBooking is essential \u2014 spaces are limited and this event often fills quickly.\n\nAbout Claudio\nClaudio is a multi-instrumentalist musician originally from Mexico City and now based in Wellington. Born into a family of musicians, he began playing music at a young age and later studied classical guitar. His journey led him to Montreal, where he explored jazz, world music, and spiritual sound traditions.\n\nExtensive travels in Asia and Europe deepened his connection with Indian music and yogic philosophy. He studied Tibetan singing bowls in Kathmandu and Varanasi, and has since worked with a wide range of instruments including the sitar, esraj, bansuri, harmonium, flutes, gongs, and voice.\n\nClaudio\u2019s work blends technical skill, deep presence, and a profound respect for the healing power of sound.\n\nLearn more or listen to Claudio\u2019s music here:\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/claudioescutiasounds\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/claudio_yoga_sound_healing\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/soundhealingyogamusicclaudio\n\n\n",

Just as knots form in the body, impressions and tensions accumulate in the mind. While we can\u2019t change the past, the Bhagavad-gita teaches that we can shape our future\u2014what we choose to cultivate now carries us forward.\nIn this one-hour workshop, we\u2019ll explore how philosophical and spiritual wisdom can help us rise above the tangles of trauma and anxiety. Through practical insights, open discussion, and guidance from the Gita\u2019s philosophy, we\u2019ll look at how to build resilience\u2014not only by steadying the nervous system, but by exploring the deeper self beyond the changing body and mind.\nMeet your host, Sivananda\nSivananda\u2019s background is in both science and music, holding a Master's Degree in Data Science, a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a long history of playing and performing on the double bass. His passion for philosophy, music, good food and community attracted him to the bhakti lifestyle.

When we connect to our inner foundations, we touch the support of those who came before and deepen our sense of belonging to life itself.\nWe\u2019ll begin with ceremonial cacao, then drop into a guided movement journey with live soundscape. There are no steps to learn, no performance\u2014just presence, curiosity, and letting your body move as it feels. Barefoot and phone-free, you\u2019re invited to drop deep into free-form movement, awakening parts of you that you may have forgotten.\nCome as you are.\nMove with what you feel.\nLeave feeling empowered, connected, and alive.\nSomatic dance is a guided movement practice that helps you tune into your body\u2019s wisdom and move from the inside out. Unlike ecstatic dance, which is typically an open, DJ-led space with no facilitation, somatic dance offers gentle guidance to support you in exploring sensation, emotion, and embodiment in a safe, intentional way. You\u2019re not learning steps or performing\u2014you're being invited into presence, curiosity, and feeling. With a focus on nervous system regulation, personal expression, and inner listening, somatic dance creates a nurturing space to come home to yourself.\nYour Hosts...\nJenna Joan | Embodiment Facilitator\nJenna Joan is a somatic therapist, yoga teacher, and group facilitator who has been leading movement spaces for over 15 years.

This is a great opportunity to connect with like-minded people and become part of the local agritourism community.\nWe have two fabulous guest speakers at our November event, who will share their agritourism journeys and thoughts on the future.\nSonia Minnaar\nSonia Minnaar is co-founder of Canopy Camping Escapes. Canopy Camping Escapes partners with glamping hosts across New Zealand. Sonia will talk to us about the foundation and growth of Canopy Camping - how they started, what they do and how they work.

It's the type of place where you feel like you're on top of the world, described as \"somewhere between heaven and earth\"!\nThe idea to set up glamping on their property came about when they came across Canopy Camping Escapes - and were inspired to set up their own retreat. Watching the moon and sunrise from the east above the Wairarapa is magical...and it's a delight for Summer and Tim to share it with their guests.\nhttps://canopycamping.co.nz/moonlight-peak\nRun of event:\n6:30pm - arrival, drinks, nibbles and networking\n6:45pm - talks start\n8:00pm - talks finish, networking\n8:30pm - Evening close\nAll welcome, see you there!\nWe will be hosted at Urla's Cellar Door, 140 Dakins Road, Gladstone.

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\n\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.\n\n",

    "description": "Dragons Is My Uso, Chef Jessica Tang and legendary home chefs Litia Lefaoseu and Iutita Mallon are drawing on the century long fusion of Chinese and Samoan cuisine and the way food expresses love, ai, and alofa. In the late 1800s, small numbers of Chinese settled in Samoa and became part of a growing multicultural community. There they influenced local customs, made an enduring contribution to Samoan cuisine introducing contemporary favourites such as sapasui (chop suey), keke pua\u2018a (pork buns) and of course laisa (rice). \r\n\r\nDragons celebrate this cultural and culinary fusion by showcasing these favourites and presenting new dishes highlighting the shared love of culinary staples such as taro and noodles, rice, fish, and pork, the magnificent spectrum of Chinese herbs, spices and flavours. Through cooking and sharing food together the chefs honour their culinary heritage, strengthen our connections to one another and celebrate the big and little moments in life. This is a shared-style meal, served banquet style on lazy Susan turntables. \r\nDragons is My Uso was one of the sell-out hits of the 2024 festival - don't miss out!\r\n\r\nDiscounted tables for 10 available for $1000, so get the whole aiga together!",

After being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition at the age of eleven that left him paralyzed from the waist down, Wes experienced a miraculous recovery for which the doctors themselves had no medical explanation.

He spent his high school years in Northern Ontario and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and three children.\n\nWesley is currently the Central Canada Director for Apologetics Canada and has been a guest on a variety of public platforms, from The Joe Rogan Experience and Piers Morgan Uncensored, to Apologia Radio and Daily Dose of Wisdom. He has participated in numerous public dialogues, debates, and interfaith events on issues of belief and religion globally.\n\nHe holds a BA in sociology from York University, a Masters of Theological Studies from Tyndale University, and is currently doing a PhD in New Testament at the University of Toronto\u2019s Wycliffe College.\n\n",

K\u0101piti Run for Youth is a lively, family-friendly event focused on fostering community spirit and supporting organisations that encourage and uplift local young people. RAIN or SHINE, get ready to have fun!\n\nWe know K\u0101piti Run for Youth helps to support amazing community work done by local fundraising partners. We have 13 incredible fundraising partners you can choose to support and raise funds for. We are very proud of them all and the work they do to uplift the youth of K\u0101piti. Each partner brings something unique to the table, from providing essential resources and mentorship to creating spaces where young people can thrive. By supporting rangatahi through education, creativity, employment, and well-being initiatives, they ensure our youth are not just supported but empowered to reach their full potential. Our partners are creating a brighter tomorrow for the young people of K\u0101piti!\n\nIn the beginning K\u0101piti Run for Youth was created by Web Genius as their way as a local business to \u2018give back\u2019 to the community so, more than a decade on we can proudly say the event is sustainable and is popular with all sorts, young and old, the fit and not so fit. K\u0101piti Run for Youth has raised $280,003 for rangatahi since inception in 2011. In 2025 the event raised $25,531 which was remarkable.\n\nK\u0101piti Run for Youth will be open for sign up early in January 2026 >> https://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/signup\n\nAt that time, we will be seeking individuals and teams to get together to walk or run from Paraparaumu Beach (Maclean Park) to Raumati Beach and back. For those choosing the 12km walk or run, they will do two circuits of the course.\n\nChoose your adventure \u2013 a 6km or 12km run or walk along the beautiful K\u0101piti coastline. Whether it's a leisurely stroll or a mad dash to be the first across the finish, you choose the event that suits you best, and which of our amazing fundraising partners you're going to raise funds for. On race day grab your dog and your mates and head down to the beach for fun, family and fitness. Registration takes place from 8.30am to 9.45am with a briefing at 9.45am and all walkers and runners starting together at 10am.\n\nOnce your profile is set-up online, let your family, friends and work mates know so they can sponsor your efforts. We encourage every participant to raise $20 through sponsorship instead of paying an entry fee. All entrants receive regular campaigns to motivate their sponsorship efforts along the way.\n\nK\u0101piti Run for Youth prides itself on being a sustainable, family-friendly event that is all about supporting each other and having fun. Join your community for a feel-good morning on the beach. Your fundraising makes a difference in the lives of our young people! BYO sunhat, sunscreen, and water on the day, and there are sponsored spot prizes, treats for the kids, certificates for participating and free Paek\u0101k\u0101riki Mini Pops for everyone at the end.\n\nCheckout our FAQs over on our website >> https://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/faqs\n\nCloser to the event, go to our website to sign up or sponsor someone that you know who is participating >>\nhttps://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/search\n\nAll registrations and sponsorship are handled securely and confidentially on the K\u0101piti Run for Youth website that is powered by Raisley and supported by Stripe online payments.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBUSINESS SPONSORSHIP\nPlatinum $1,000+, Gold $500, Silver $250, Bronze $125 is available for businesses who want to support the underlying work of this event and rangatahi youth of K\u0101piti.

    "description": "Porirua Parkrun, What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

It starts on Sun 24 August and runs for 4 weeks until Sun 14 September, 2pm - 5pm.\nBeginners will practice the basic techniques in copper or brass and then move on to working in silver. An excellent first project for beginners in this class is to create a simple textured ring band - but once you have the basics down, it is fun to create earrings, pendants or other simple items. Learning to cut, heat, form and texture metal - to solder using a jeweller's torch and silver solder, and finally to polish your work up to a beautiful finish: these classes are super satisfying.\nThese blocks are also a nice way for existing students or more advanced makers to work on more challenging projects and join friendly classes in our well-equipped warm studio!\nBasic materials are supplied and there are extra materials available to purchase as you need in class.\nThis block is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. NOTE: Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.\nOur booking system asks for full payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time please email us to arrange this\nCourse fee $280, Early bird pricing $252 till 27 July. ",

    "description": "Jonathan Kay - Massey University Lecturer/Master of Fine Arts Coordinator, Jonathan Kay is a photographic artist, researcher, and lecturer based at Massey University in Te Whanganui-a-Tara/Wellington. His work explores the intersection of art and science, using photography to reveal the unseen and challenge conventional notions of landscape. Over the past seven years, his research has focused on developing a site-specific and responsive approach to photographic interventions within the landscape.\nDrawing inspiration from scientific 'fieldwork,' Kay\u2019s practice involves close observation and data collection, using these methods to uncover new insights into specific environments. However, his approach extends beyond the typical scientific framework by leveraging the unique possibilities of the photographic medium. This process enables him to move beyond the traditional, idealized representation of landscapes, offering deeper, more complex interpretations.\nSeptember 25, Tararua Tramping Club (4 Moncrieff St, Mt Victoria), Doors Open at 7pm\nIf you\u2019re curious about the Wellington Photographic Society, you\u2019re welcome to attend two meetings for free before deciding whether to join.

I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us.

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods. Her works have appeared in the Politics, International Politics, Political Science, PS: Political Science & Politics, Journal of Contemporary China, Pacific Review, and Asian Security.\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 04:30 PM - 05:30 PM\nWelcome reception with refreshments and light catering\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 06:30 PM\nKeynote address: Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal Intern\nHost: Christina Lai\n\n\n",

His productions are jagged and abstract, built from negative space, ambient haze and rhythms that never quite resolve. There\u2019s hip hop in the DNA, but it never plays by the rules, always veering towards something stranger, softer, rawer.\n\nThrough his label PLZ Make It Ruins, Vegyn has built an entire world. His 2019 debut Only Diamonds Cut Diamonds felt like a manifesto; the 71-track Text While Driving If You Want To Meet God! followed as a chaotic, genre-agnostic statement of intent. Since then, he\u2019s ventured further leftfield, releasing The Head Hurts but the Heart Knows the Truth under the alias Headache, followed by the 2024 masterpiece The Road to Hell Is Paved with Good Intention, and the unexpected arrival of Blue Moon Safari - an output that feels made more for himself than for any audience. Dreamlike, disjointed and deeply personal.\n\nAs a DJ, Vegyn shifts between industrial breaks, ambient drift and warped club memories. This October, he returns to Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Wellington and Auckland - a rare chance to slip through the cracks and step inside his world.\n\n",

Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor. This is despite his daughter being one of the pupils benefiting most from the free expression encouraged by Antonio\u2019s Freinet method teachings. Meanwhile, Ariadna teeters between hope and despair in her search for closure \u2013 a human vessel embodying the plight of a nation still wrestling with the consequences of a brutal conflict.\n\nThe closing credits remark that the remains of 12,000 people have been exhumed across the country. Like Ariadna, the film attempts to seek answers from the horrors of a war that took place almost a century ago \u2013 one driven by political sentiments that feel unsettlingly familiar as some of today\u2019s most powerful nations shift towards fascism. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

Inseparable in childhood, the brothers drifted apart as adults, brother Rocky (also O\u2019Brien) living out and proud in Portland while Roman lived a (decidedly hetero) tradie life in hometown Idaho. It seems he\u2019ll never have the chance to work through his complicated feelings towards his twin until stumbling upon a bereavement group for just such a purpose.\n\nThere he meets Dennis (James Sweeney). Neurotic, sarcastic, gay, he\u2019s the opposite that attracts as the pair bond over trauma and a deep need for attachment. They quickly become each other\u2019s emotional support twin-surrogate, on call for late night grocery trips, afterwork bitch sessions, and road trip singalongs. But odd couple bliss can\u2019t last, as Dennis has more than friendship in mind, Roman grapples with explosive anger issues, and dark secrets inevitably come to light.\n\nSweeny\u2019s sophomore effort as writer, director, and co-star walks an entertaining balance between discomfort and hilarity. With finely calibrated performances from both leads, Twinless is witty, warped, and surprisingly warm hearted. \u2014 Adrian Hatwell",

H\u00e9ctor is not. When she tells them she\u2019s pregnant, her own parents can\u2019t hide their shock \u2013 loving but concerned that their daughter will be unable to tackle the task of motherhood. Will the baby be born deaf? Uncertainty abounds as the due date draws closer, and it\u2019s not just \u00c1ngela\u2019s parents who are beginning to have doubts.\n\nThe foundations for the film\u2019s narrative derive from the personal experiences of first-time actor Miriam Garlo, Libertad\u2019s own sister, as she began to contemplate motherhood as a deaf woman. When surrounded by her other deaf friends, \u00c1ngela is comfortable, alive, vibrant within a community that supports her. Around the local mums in the park, or her husband\u2019s friends, isolation sets in with a painful immediacy that anyone who has ever struggled to understand the language in a foreign country will know all too well. A poignant story bound by the chemistry of its leads, deafness is woven into the film as a lived experience, not a defining label. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

Distance and death became everyday realities for Kiwis at home \u2013 and caused griefs that were at times taboo and suppressed.\n\nDame Gaylene Preston frames seven women, including her own mother, against a black background that creates a stage for their candid, unadorned and surprisingly intimate wartime recollections, as they look back from the 90s in interviews conducted by oral historian Judith Fyfe. The acclaimed documentary, which combines these shared testimonies with personal photographs and newsreel clips, conveys the immense pressure to conform to the value of stoic sacrifice for the cause under the scrutinising eye of neighbours, and reveals lesser-seen layers of resilience.\n\nMarriages in the first flush of romance were cut short, pregnancies were navigated alone, conscientious objectors were met with ostracisation and American servicemen scorned, in a nation united around support of their boys in combat overseas \u2013 a state of affairs in which women were often granted little voice, as they took on more labour, and absorbed life-changing losses. \u2014 Carmen Gray",

But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

    "description": "Film screening: GAGA, Film screening: GAGA\nJoin us for a special screening of the 2022 Taiwanese comedy-drama film GAGA, featuring a Q&A with the award-winning Director, Laha Mebow\n\nAbout this Event\n\nGaga\u300a\u54c8\u52c7\u5bb6\u300b(2022)\nDirected by Laha Mebow 112 mins, Mandarin/Atayal/Taiwanese, English subtitles\nAmong the Atayal indigenous people of Taiwan, gaga is the traditional law and custom, the way of living with the land and organising society, the source of values. When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\n\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\n\n\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.\n\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events10/banners/8cd1bb10-7456-11f0-994e-1dce379af11a-rimg-w570-h740-dc090807-gmir.jpg\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 07:50 PM\nFilm Screening: Gaga\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:50 PM - 08:00 PM\nQ & A with Director\nHost: Laha Mebow\n\n\n",

Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

The tent is lovely during the day, but as it gets dark, it takes on a magical feeling. Fairy lights and crystals lit by gently changing coloured lights. We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle. Arniya then dances the energy in with Celestial Energy Movement, for the group. This creates a vortex of Divine power into the middle of the tent. Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\n",

From a young age she was drawn to music as a means for reflection and self-expression. During her music studies at university, she was introduced to taonga p\u016boro, and this sparked a personal journey of reconnection to te ao M\u0101ori and her own whakapapa. Following university, she lived in an ashram for several years where she was introduced to the wonderful practice of bhakti yoga. She now lives with her husband in the Wellington region, where they regularly participate in kirtan (mantra music meditation) at Bhakti Lounge.\n\nPeter is P\u0101keh\u0101, with grandparents from England and Ireland, and has been on a four-year journey learning the art of taonga p\u016boro \u2014 the traditional M\u0101ori musical instruments of Aotearoa. Guided by the wisdom and generosity of expert makers and players, he has learned both to craft and to play these unique instruments. For Peter, taonga p\u016boro offer a way to connect deeply with sound, story, and the natural world, and he is excited to share their voices as part of this sound bath experience.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the menu?\nJackfruit Rendang\n\nSatay Seitan Skewer\n\nGado Gado salad with peanut sauce\n\nRice\n\nBanana cake with caramel sauce\n\nHot \"chocolate\"",

When we connect to our inner foundations, we touch the support of those who came before and deepen our sense of belonging to life itself.\nWe\u2019ll begin with ceremonial cacao, then drop into a guided movement journey with live soundscape. There are no steps to learn, no performance\u2014just presence, curiosity, and letting your body move as it feels. Barefoot and phone-free, you\u2019re invited to drop deep into free-form movement, awakening parts of you that you may have forgotten.\nCome as you are.\nMove with what you feel.\nLeave feeling empowered, connected, and alive.\nSomatic dance is a guided movement practice that helps you tune into your body\u2019s wisdom and move from the inside out. Unlike ecstatic dance, which is typically an open, DJ-led space with no facilitation, somatic dance offers gentle guidance to support you in exploring sensation, emotion, and embodiment in a safe, intentional way. You\u2019re not learning steps or performing\u2014you're being invited into presence, curiosity, and feeling. With a focus on nervous system regulation, personal expression, and inner listening, somatic dance creates a nurturing space to come home to yourself.\nYour Hosts...\nJenna Joan | Embodiment Facilitator\nJenna Joan is a somatic therapist, yoga teacher, and group facilitator who has been leading movement spaces for over 15 years. With a background in yoga, somatic dance, and therapeutic embodiment, her work blends play, authenticity, and deep nervous system awareness. Jenna is also a cacao alchemist and ceremonial facilitator, known for creating safe, soulful spaces that invite freedom, connection, and inner exploration. She has been hosting workshops, retreats, and community events for nearly a decade, and also works 1:1 in more therapeutic settings.\nSonic Sutra | Somatic Dance DJ\nSonic Sutra is a sound artist and somatic dance DJ who creates immersive musical journeys designed to support authentic movement, emotional release, and deep embodiment. With a focus on somatic dance and therapeutic soundscapes, their sets are intentionally curated to guide dancers through an inner experience\u2014honouring the body\u2019s natural rhythms and the intelligence within. Their offerings create safe, accessible spaces for people of all bodies, backgrounds, and experience levels to explore movement, presence, and connection.
