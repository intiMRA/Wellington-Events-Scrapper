Tourette Syndrome was barely understood at the time - even by doctors - causing John years of isolation, anxiety and shame.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Davidson reached his late twenties that things started to change. After meeting Dottie, the mother of a former school friend, who had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer, a strong bond formed between the pair. With Dottie\u2019s unwavering support, John discovered the confidence to be himself.\n\nWritten and directed by Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine), I Swear features an astonishing lead performance from Aramayo, joined by the excellent supporting cast of Maxine Peake (Funny Cow), Shirley Henderson (Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary) and Peter Mullan (Trainspotting). A frank, funny and touching story about the transformative power of friendship and community, I Swear is a crowd-pleaser you can\u2019t miss in this year\u2019s line-up.\nDirector\nKirk Jones\nCast\nRobert Aramayo, Maxine Peake, Shirley Henderson, Peter Mullan",

    "description": "Book Launch - South by South by Charles Ferrall, Join us to celebrate the publication of Charles Ferrall's South by South: New Zealand and the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The book will be launched by Harry Ricketts.\n\n- Thursday 18 September, 6pm\n- Unity Books Wellington\n- Free event \u2013 all welcome!\n\nJoseph Kinsey is not a name many of us know \u2013 or not as well as we know the name Robert Falcon Scott. But from his base in Christchurch, Kinsey \u2013 book and art collector, philanthropist, science enthusiast, businessman \u2013 forged deep connections with the Antarctic expeditions and the explorers themselves through his tireless work as the agent for various expeditions. Two other New Zealanders also formed close friendships: Charles Bowen, a former politician, and Wellington lawyer Leonard Tripp, to whom Shackleton declared: \u2018I love you as David and Jonathan loved.\u2019\n\nSouth by South tells the story of New Zealand\u2019s role in \u2018the Heroic Age\u2019, that wave of exploration beginning at the end of the nineteenth century in which men set out to traverse the continent of Antarctica and, if they survived, to bring home their findings. The members of this New Zealander triumvirate were all believers in the British Empire, but the southern voyages were to an uninhabited land.\n\nSouth by South brings to light many letters, newspaper articles, and pieces of official correspondence, much of which has not been published before, during the five expeditions of 1901\u20131916: the Discovery, Nimrod, Terra Nova, Aurora, and Endurance. In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship. What they and the explorers wrote was influenced by nineteenth-century adventure stories which conveyed the Imperialist ideals of the time. If the impending conflict of 1914\u201318 was a very \u2018literary war\u2019, this was a very literary exploration.\n\nCharles Ferrall is an associate professor at Te Herenga Waka\u2013Victoria University of Wellington. Among his books are Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics (2001); The Trials of Eric Mareo (2002), co-written with Rebecca Ellis; East by South: China in the Australasian Imagination (2006), co-edited with Paul Millar and Keren Smith; Juvenile Literature and British Society 1850\u20131950 (2009), co-written with Anna Jackson; Henry Lawson in New Zealand (2012); How We Remember: New Zealanders and the First World War (2014), co-edited with Harry Ricketts; and Remembering Gallipoli: Interviews with New Zealand Gallipoli Veterans (2015), co-edited with Christopher Pugsley.\n\nCover photograph: The ship Discovery leaving Lyttelton Harbour, 1901.

    "description": "Book Launch - All Her Lives by Ingrid Horrocks, Join us to celebrate a new work from Ingrid Horrocks, her first book of fiction!\n- Thursday 9 October, 6pm\n- Unity Books Wellington\n- Free event \u2013 all welcome!\nAll Her Lives follows women across generations as they resist, nurture and transform. These are lives shaped by love and politics, motherhood and memory, constraint and defiance.\nFrom girls raised in the garden of Plunket founder Truby King, to a queer university student at a mid-2000s Berlin rave, to a mother facing the cost of her son\u2019s climate rebellion, the women of All Her Lives are complex, resilient and deeply human. Shadowing their stories is the early feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, whose journey of grief and revolution will become a vessel for what endures \u2013 and for finding hope.\nVast and intimate, All Her Lives explores the layered selfhood of women \u2013 all that they inherit, sacrifice, imagine and carry forward \u2013 and the power found in unravelling and reweaving those selves on their own terms.\n'A wonderful collection that swims in and out of women's lives across time, exploring the struggle for freedom and love. I'll be thinking about it for a long time - a book of quiet force.' \u2014Emily Perkins, author of Lioness\nIngrid Horrocks\u2019s books include the memoir Where We Swim (2021), a literary history, Women Wanderers and the Writing of Mobility (2017), and two collections of poetry. Her writing has appeared in Lithub, The Ninth Letter, The Sydney Review of Books, The Spinoff, Landfall, and the Guardian. In 2024 she was the Kaituhi Tar\u0101whare CNZ Writer in Residence at the International Institute of Modern Letters, and in 2025 she was awarded the Michael King Writers Centre Australian Residency at Varuna. Ingrid lives in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Wellington, with her partner and twin daughters.",

Shut her eyes. Rolled their names around her brain. Stacked each person in order like folded laundry, warm and crisp from the sun. She wondered how her name would sound amongst them.\n\nIn the rural reaches of Auckland, the women of the eclectic Gordon family gather for Christmas. They may push each other\u2019s buttons, but know precisely when to offer tea (or a tipple). Rita, the 50-year-old baby of the family, is planning to tell them she has cancer. Drifting between past and present, she considers the lives of women in their community and reckons with what it all means for her future and her family.\n\nFeaturing elderly lesbians, twins who aren\u2019t twins, and several dogs named Roger, Hoods Landing is about shoddy pasts, ambiguous futures and the imperfect bonds that tie family together.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nLaura Vincent (Ng\u0101ti M\u0101hanga, Ng\u0101puhi) is an author whose work spans fiction, poetry and food writing. She has written the food blog hungryandfrozen.com since 2007, and her debut cookbook was published by Penguin Random House in 2013. Laura\u2019s poetry has appeared in anthologies published by \u0100poro Press, Auckland University Press and Muswell Press, and she completed her Master of Creative Writing at Auckland University of Technology in 2022. Born in Waiuku, Laura currently lives in T\u0101maki Makaurau. Hoods Landing is her first novel.\n\n",

    "description": "Book Launch - South by South by Charles Ferrall, Join us to celebrate the publication of Charles Ferrall's South by South: New Zealand and the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The book will be launched by Harry Ricketts.\n\n- Thursday 18 September, 6pm\n- Unity Books Wellington\n- Free event \u2013 all welcome!\n\nJoseph Kinsey is not a name many of us know \u2013 or not as well as we know the name Robert Falcon Scott. But from his base in Christchurch, Kinsey \u2013 book and art collector, philanthropist, science enthusiast, businessman \u2013 forged deep connections with the Antarctic expeditions and the explorers themselves through his tireless work as the agent for various expeditions. Two other New Zealanders also formed close friendships: Charles Bowen, a former politician, and Wellington lawyer Leonard Tripp, to whom Shackleton declared: \u2018I love you as David and Jonathan loved.\u2019\n\nSouth by South tells the story of New Zealand\u2019s role in \u2018the Heroic Age\u2019, that wave of exploration beginning at the end of the nineteenth century in which men set out to traverse the continent of Antarctica and, if they survived, to bring home their findings. The members of this New Zealander triumvirate were all believers in the British Empire, but the southern voyages were to an uninhabited land.\n\nSouth by South brings to light many letters, newspaper articles, and pieces of official correspondence, much of which has not been published before, during the five expeditions of 1901\u20131916: the Discovery, Nimrod, Terra Nova, Aurora, and Endurance. In particular, Scott\u2019s letters to Kinsey and Shackleton\u2019s to Tripp tell of their hope, despair, exhaustion, and deep gratitude for their friendship. What they and the explorers wrote was influenced by nineteenth-century adventure stories which conveyed the Imperialist ideals of the time. If the impending conflict of 1914\u201318 was a very \u2018literary war\u2019, this was a very literary exploration.\n\nCharles Ferrall is an associate professor at Te Herenga Waka\u2013Victoria University of Wellington. Among his books are Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics (2001); The Trials of Eric Mareo (2002), co-written with Rebecca Ellis; East by South: China in the Australasian Imagination (2006), co-edited with Paul Millar and Keren Smith; Juvenile Literature and British Society 1850\u20131950 (2009), co-written with Anna Jackson; Henry Lawson in New Zealand (2012); How We Remember: New Zealanders and the First World War (2014), co-edited with Harry Ricketts; and Remembering Gallipoli: Interviews with New Zealand Gallipoli Veterans (2015), co-edited with Christopher Pugsley.\n\nCover photograph: The ship Discovery leaving Lyttelton Harbour, 1901.

The English visual artist is best known for her innovative and contemporary sculpture and installation art. Her large-scale, immersive installations explore themes of destruction and reconstruction, transformation and metamorphosis. Objects are exploded, crushed, and suspended in a world upended and remade anew.\nCurated by independent UK-based curator Andrea Schlieker and City Gallery Wellington\u2019s Senior Curator Aaron Lister, City Gallery Wellington's exhibition will encompass Parker\u2019s long career as an artist. This includes an immersive sound and light installation, \u2018Stolen Thunder\u2019. The work gathers the sounds of approaching storms from around the globe and across time. The exhibition will also showcase her paintings, photos, films, and sculptures.\n\u201cI have always said this is the one exhibition I want to do before I die,\u201d said Charlotte Davy, Ringatohu Toi Director Art and City Gallery Wellington. \u201cI have been following Cornelia Parker\u2019s work for the last twenty years. Bringing her mischievous, dark, and literally explosive work to Wellington is incredible.\u201d \nParker\u2019s work often fills entire rooms and invites the viewer to move through and around the art. Given its physical scale, the blank canvas of the reopened gallery offers the perfect opportunity to host the exhibition. The exhibition will kick off in October 2026, carrying through to March 2027. \nCharlotte notes the exhibition\u2019s themes are also of particular relevance to Wellington. \u201cI hope that the exhibition and our return to Te Ng\u0101kau Civic Square will reflect our city and also help remake it. We are looking forward to opening with a bang.\u201d\nHero image: \u00a9 Cornelia Parker. Courtesy of the artist and Frith Street Gallery, London",

Writing with courage and insight, he was a lover of language and a champion of the underdog.\nTwo plays: timeless, universal, distinct. Following their critically acclaimed, sold out run of THINGS I KNOW TO BE TRUE, actor Stephen Lovatt and director Shane Bosher return to Circa for a not-to-be missed theatrical encounter with a master craftsman.\nProductions play on alternate nights with an opportunity to see both productions in conversation with each other on Saturdays.\nTHE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER\n\u201cI invite you to join me, in a voyage into the past, to that territory of the heart we call childhood.\u201d\nBruce Mason\u2019s quintessential Kiwi classic chronicles the friendship between a 12-year-old boy and Firpo, a social outcast who dreams of winning an Olympic medal.\nThrough the boy\u2019s eyes we see the wonder of life on a perfect beach, in a perfect 1930s New Zealand, during a perfect summer. It\u2019s a world of magic and transformation, where anything can happen and miracles seem possible.\nWhen the boy sets out to help Firpo make his athletic dream a reality, ignoring his father\u2019s rebukes and community ridicule, a battle rages between the eternal optimism of childhood and the harsh pragmatism of adulthood.\nGliding effortlessly between flights of poetic fancy and blunt everyday speech, THE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER is New Zealand storytelling at its very best.\nNOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES\nAn adolescent boy tries to find his place in an adult-dominated world. A young man retraces an intensely felt boyhood experience of bullying. A playwright in his last days reconciles the value of an artistic life and challenges the idea of New Zealand identity.\nComic disasters and confronting your own hubris. NOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES is a richly autobiographical search for self-expression. Profound and true, it is a set of variations about over-reaching, cheekily confronting our very own Tall Poppy Syndrome. ",

Being open to these moments enhances our lives and the lives of those around us,' Dixey says.\n'In psychology, these tiny moments that stimulate positive feelings are called glimmers.'\nGold is a chemical element with the symbol Au and atomic number 79.\n'Welcome to Glimmers of Gold.'\nAbout Jo Dixey\nDixey is a Royal School of Needlework trained embroiderer.

    "description": "Glimmers of Gold | Embroidery by Jo Dixey, A gorgeous new exhibition pops up in Old St Paul's vestry this September featuring 79 hand embroidered golden humans.\nEmbroiderer Jo Dixey is constantly fascinated by the short interactions we have as humans that leave us with calm or happy feelings; feelings that can last for the rest of the day or sometimes much longer.\n'This can be sharing a smile with a stranger on a beautiful day or even in the rain, chatting with people in a long queue, collectively watching a great movie. Being open to these moments enhances our lives and the lives of those around us,' Dixey says.\n'In psychology, these tiny moments that stimulate positive feelings are called glimmers.'\nGold is a chemical element with the symbol Au and atomic number 79.\n'Welcome to Glimmers of Gold.'\nAbout Jo Dixey\nDixey is a Royal School of Needlework trained embroiderer. She teaches small groups a variety of embroidery techniques, works on commissions which have included large altar cloths, university banners and work for the fashion and movie industries, and repairs old embroideries. She holds exhibitions of her embroidered pieces every few years.\nIn 2017, Dixey published her first book Stitch People, which was later re-released as Creative Thread.\nHer work is held in private and public collections in New Zealand and overseas.

I moved to beautiful Aotearoa from Sweden a few years ago, and my journey with ceramics started in 2023 and I've been elbows deep in clay ever since. I use flora found all over the world, and outside my doorsteps, to shape my artwork. My ceramic pieces are all hand made and no piece will be the other alike. I mainly throw a shape on the wheel and then let it tell me what it wants to become.\nThis exhibition is guided by Ecclesiastes 3:1-11. I think life is beautiful in it's times of joy, but also in the times of struggle, where we can grow and learn.\nA Time for Everything\nThere is a time for everything,\nand a season for every activity under the heavens:\na time to be born and a time to die,\na time to plant and a time to uproot,\na time to kill and a time to heal,\na time to tear down and a time to build,\na time to weep and a time to laugh,\na time to mourn and a time to dance,\na time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,\na time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,\na time to search and a time to give up,\na time to keep and a time to throw away,\na time to tear and a time to mend,\na time to be silent and a time to speak,\na time to love and a time to hate,\na time for war and a time for peace.\nWhat do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.\n",

Nothing is ever so simple.\nThis genre-defying work of dance, theatre, live film, clown and absurd philosophising takes the idea of the \u2018trigger warning\u2019 to its absurdist extreme to question how \u2018informed\u2019 consent can really be, and asking \u2018How much do you really want to know?\u2019\nCreated and performed by multi-award-winning maverick of the stage, Eliza Sanders, Manage Your Expectations helps us to see the limits of the power to communicate and our failures to say what we mean. Through movement, multimedia, and razor-sharp wit, it examines the impossibility of perfect communication, musing on the influence of context, identity and personal history while creating something beautiful from our collective mess.\n\"Clever, witty, evocative, subversive, immersive, despairing, poignant, personal and universal\" \u2014 Deirdre Tarrant, Theatreview, 2024\n\"Beautifully vulnerable\" - Chloe Jaques, Theatreview, 2024\nFull of vigour, energy, chaos and a hint of confrontation, Manage Your Expectations is a mind (and body) bending show about how we connect in an increasingly complex world. And you decide the ending\u2026\nContent warning: this show contains explicit content, mild coarse language, heavy nudity, themes of abortion and rape.\nWINNER: Best Performer, Whang\u0101rei Fringe 2024\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance, NZ Fringe 2024\nWINNER: San Diego Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Best in Fringe, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Innovative Work, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Sydney Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Auckland Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Melbourne Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Adelaide Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Original Production, Wellington Theatre Awards 2024",

As we continue our exploration of Dmitri Shostakovich's journey 50 years after his death, we present his fourth symphony.

It stayed hidden for decades, a secret too dangerous to share.\nWe partner with At The World's Edge Music Festival (AWE) to present the stunning talents of soloists Benjamin Baker (violin) and Yura Lee (viola) in a performance of Mozart\u2019s luminous Sinfonia Concertante. This work offers a moment of balance \u2014 a conversation between violin and viola, full of warmth and understanding, reminding us of beauty even in troubled times.\nWith generous support from the Orchestra Wellington Foundation we also reveal a brand-new secret: the world premiere of \"House of the Faun\" by WIlliam Philipson, the 2025 SOUNZ Commission for Orchestra and Sistema Youth Orchestra | Te Tono Mahinga a SOUNZ m\u0101 te R\u0101ngi Puoro me te R\u0101ngi Puoro Taiohi a Sistema.

They bring their deep musical connection to festivals across New Zealand, playing their favourite songs and tunes collected over years of playing together at festivals, stages and late into the night at kitchen tables.\n\nBased in Wellington, Bob is one of NZ's best known folk songwriters. His songs have been covered by artists in NZ, Australia, the UK and USA. New Zealand Musician magazine compared his songwriting to Bruce Springsteen and Mark Knopfler; the Dominion Post likened him to Jackson Brown, James Taylor, Luka Bloom and Dougie Ma\u00adcLean. A guitarist, he is known for both his open-tuned acoustic fingerstyle style and electric guitar playing. He has toured widely in NZ, Australia, Canada, Ireland, the UK and USA. His latest album, released in June 2024, is Lost Stars, an extended release on CD and download featuring new recordings and rarities, with Emily on violin and piano.\n\nFrom Whangarei, Emily is a virtuoso violinist inspired by the Scottish tradition and the modern trad movement. Classically trained, she is infinitely adaptable with her gorgeous stylings and fiery tune playing and the perfect foil for Bob's lyrical songs.\n\nDon't miss a chance to see these two consummate musicians share their footstomping collection of banging tunes, favourite songs and stolen moments from the last 20 years.",

In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene.\nTiming:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLecture dates:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

They trust each other, the audience, improv, and the moment to find their form. Nothing is decided beforehand.\n\nRich and Rebecca Sohn met as improvisers in Chicago over 30 years ago. As long-time teachers, this duo show began when former students asked them to headline a new evening of improv. Students often expressed surprise at how different their teaching styles were and took to saying \u201cyou\u2019re in the Sohn zone\u201d when seeing the couple work together.\n\nD.E.I.'s - Mo Munn & Ralph Hilaga\n\nWhen two besties land jobs at a prestigious company, they discover they\u2019re not there for their skills \u2014 they\u2019re the token hires. What follows is an improvised journey of chaos, corporate jargon, and an earnest attempt to prove they\u2019re more than just the diversity checkbox.\n\nFrom the chaotic minds of Wellington improv duo Mo and Ralph, D.E.I.\u2019s is a sharp, satirical, improvised workplace comedy about tokenism, identity, and the conundrums of modern day allyship. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what happens when the diversity quota starts talking back \u2014 this is it.\n\nAs the Sohn Zone is improvised, we cannot guarantee the presence or absence of specific content or themes beyond what is in the description above.

There\u2019s a feeling though that nothing is premeditated and that improvisation is the star of the show - the kind of performance that requires decades of experience. Luckily for us, Julian and Amber have this in spades. Do yourself a favour, I guarantee you\u2019ve seen nothing like it.\u201d\n- Sam Cullen - Singer/Songwriter\n\u201cEven having an understanding of the type of show The Amber Temple would be putting on when booking them - I was blown away by the amount of drama, tension and world-building Julian & Amber are able to accomplish in such an agile performance.

In this brand new staging by director Anapela Polataivao (Red White and Brass, Wild Dogs Under My Skirt), this story will be told as never before.\n\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he metes out his punishment in the cruellest way possible: by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth, to be fed to the terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze: the Minotaur. As King Minos triumphs, his great monster \u201cwill eat your future, it will rip your hope, it will stamp your youth, your children in the sand.\u201d\n\nAs the vindictive king will soon learn, however, these youth will not accept their fate without a fierce challenge.

    "description": "The Life of Henry the Fifth, A young man, once revelling in freedom and reckless camaraderie, is thrust into the role of a king, burdened with the fate of England.\nVictory or ruin rests on his shoulders, yet his newfound power isolates him, leaving him lost, uncertain, and deeply unsettled.\nBetrayed by friends, mistrusted by his men, and taunted by those who seek his downfall, Henry\u2019s journey is both severe and profoundly relatable.\nShakespeare crafts a world where soldiers fight without knowing why, where the battlefield sees vagrants and children stand shoulder to shoulder, where uncertain rulers navigate a landscape devoid of guidance from the past. It is a world that, despite its historical setting, feels unnervingly close to our own.\nWith only ten dynamic performers, this is Henry the Fifth like never before: stripped back, sharp, and driven by the raw intensity of Shakespeare\u2019s text.\nExpect fast-paced storytelling, immersive staging, and a production that puts the audience at the heart of the battle.\nFull show duration: 95 min including a 15 min intermission.\n\u201cThis production epitomises what can be achieved when talent, teamwork, hard work, opportunity and passion combine.\u2019\u201d\nNZ Herald on The Tragedy of Macbeth ",

This 4-session block course teaches teens how to use drawing to process hard feelings and access their own inner resources, which can be used at home as visual journaling.\nDates\nThis block course consists of 4 workshops:\n4.15pm-5.30pm\nTuesday 19th August - Metaphors for feelings\nTuesday 26th August - Uncovering needs\nTuesday 2nd September - Unlocking self-compassion\nMonday 8th September - Curiosity in direction\nCost\n$184 total ($46 per session)\nIncluded in each session\nYou will be guided by Lara Phillips, a trained creative facilitator in Interactive Drawing Therapy, through drawing prompts (similar to a guided meditation or journaling) to draw out where you are at and draw out your own inner guidance. No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz\n\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing. It is not intended as therapy nor does it replace counselling, therapy, or any other medical or clinical professional help. Participants are guided to draw out where they are at, whilst drawing out their own inner resources for support and guidance.\nParticipants understand it is their own responsibility to manage their mental and physical health during sessions, to opt in and out of activities as they see fit, and make the facilitator aware if further support is required.",

Nothing is ever so simple.\nThis genre-defying work of dance, theatre, live film, clown and absurd philosophising takes the idea of the \u2018trigger warning\u2019 to its absurdist extreme to question how \u2018informed\u2019 consent can really be, and asking \u2018How much do you really want to know?\u2019\nCreated and performed by multi-award-winning maverick of the stage, Eliza Sanders, Manage Your Expectations helps us to see the limits of the power to communicate and our failures to say what we mean. Through movement, multimedia, and razor-sharp wit, it examines the impossibility of perfect communication, musing on the influence of context, identity and personal history while creating something beautiful from our collective mess.\n\"Clever, witty, evocative, subversive, immersive, despairing, poignant, personal and universal\" \u2014 Deirdre Tarrant, Theatreview, 2024\n\"Beautifully vulnerable\" - Chloe Jaques, Theatreview, 2024\nFull of vigour, energy, chaos and a hint of confrontation, Manage Your Expectations is a mind (and body) bending show about how we connect in an increasingly complex world. And you decide the ending\u2026\nContent warning: this show contains explicit content, mild coarse language, heavy nudity, themes of abortion and rape.\nWINNER: Best Performer, Whang\u0101rei Fringe 2024\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance, NZ Fringe 2024\nWINNER: San Diego Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Best in Fringe, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Innovative Work, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Sydney Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Auckland Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Melbourne Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Adelaide Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Original Production, Wellington Theatre Awards 2024",

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation",

ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!! This booking is for FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER\n                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cWithin the DNA is written not only our histories as individuals but the whole history of the human race \u2026 patterns of DNA that have come down to us virtually unchanged from our distant ancestors \u2013 ancestors who are no longer just an abstract entity but real people who lived in conditions very different from those we enjoy today, who survived them and brought up their children.\u201d ~ Bryan Sykes (The Seven Daughters of Eve)\nReturn to MAIN EXHIBITION WEBSITE - link coming soon",

    "description": "Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days, Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days\nThis workshop is ideal for advanced students who have already learned how to set cabochon stones. Over two three-hour sessions, 20 and 27 September, 10am-1pm, you will be given an understanding of the technique of setting faceted stones using a setting burr, hammers, punches and burnishing tools. This is the first step in learning to flush set facet cut stones so they sit below the surface of the metal.\n\nSession 1 will cover the technique, demonstrations and the basics of preparing and cutting the setting. Students will be shown how to set their stones, and may begin to do this in class, but will then go on to repeat and practice the technique in their own time.\nThey can do this at home, or for a small extra cost, can stay on at the studio to practice setting for the afternoon.\n\nSession 2 will pick up on the setting techniques, reminding and refining essential steps in the process. Troubleshooting can be covered in this class, as well as learning to clean up the settings. The principles of this setting technique will be covered in a few different scenarios, as some students may wish to take this skill into different styles or directions.\n\nThe option for students to have a half-day bench hire after class will also apply to this session.\n\nWhat is provided: class fees cover your practice metal (copper) and stones (CZ) and detailed handouts that are useful for you to take away to refer to when practising and honing your skills.\n\nCorrectly sized drills and setting burrs will be provided in class, but students must purchase their own burrs for practice after class and any future bench hires. These are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nWhat to bring: Advanced students can bring projects to set stones into, but please note the metal must be at least 2mm thick and we do not allow brass to be used as a project or practice for beginners. The metal must be copper or sterling silver.\n\nStudents should bring either a craft magnifier or magnifying lenses/glasses. If you have your own flex shaft tool you plan to use at home for drilling and setting, please also bring this along so that your tutor can advise on the best way to use it. We have two drilling machines in the studio, and these must be shared between the students, so if you have a machine, do bring it.\n\nPractice bench hire after class $20 per person (till 4pm) must be booked in advance.\n\nWorkshop fee $195, Early bird $175 till 24 August.\n\n",

This one is for tangata Tiriti who are deeply committed to an ethic of restoration in Aotearoa and want to go beyond an intellectual understanding.\nJoin Rebecca and Mel from The P\u0101keh\u0101 Project for this one-day workshop exploring the mahi we as tangata Tiriti can do in the journey towards a Tiriti-led future. Using practices of Haumanu, a healing-centred approach to systems change, we\u2019ll be inquiring into our own roles in reweaving the relational fabric that Te Tiriti o Waitangi offered to all people in Aotearoa, but that did not happen at the time.\nWe invite you into a space for gently inquiring into your unique place in the system rewiring itself. How do we show up where M\u0101ori are calling us to be? We'll be exploring relationality and worldview; the nervous system as map for working with activation; systemic racism, the orthodox Western worldview\u2014its whakapapa and how it shows up in ourselves, our systems and society; and our roles in restorative systems change for a Tiriti-based future.

Over five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nDescription\nMany of us live sedentary lifestyles, sitting for up to eight hours or more a day hunched over our keyboard - all the while rarely taking a proper breath! Even if we wanted to take a deep enriching breath into the lower lobes of our lungs, we are limited due to our posture. Often due to the stresses and strains of a busy work and life balance, our unconscious brain can develop a pattern of holding, irregular and shadow breaths.\n\nDoes this sound like your experience?\n\nNot being able to breathe properly is the key cause of many chronic respiratory diseases (Nestor, 2020)\n\nCalligratherapy combines science journalist James Nestor's theory on proper breathing with the philosophy of ancient Chinese calligraphy to promote a state of optimal wellbeing.\n\nCalligratherapy has been developed specifically for those who have never practiced calligraphy before and who are interested in deriving the benefits without having to learn the language or all the characters. It integrates the simple and intuitive act of inhaling and exhaling into calligraphy practice with Eastern philosophy behind it.\n\nA range of different breathing exercises are embedded into each 90-minute session focusing on different calligraphy scripts. Over the five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing, while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nAll materials included in course fee.\n\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:\n\nStart a new creative practice in Chinese soft brush calligraphy\nDevelop your own mindfulness strategy\nBetter manage everyday stress levels and access a calm, empowered and positive state of mind\nFind ways to explore eastern philosophy and develop deeper connections with your spiritual self.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

    "description": "Dolores Mosquera Wellington New Zealand May 2026, Day 1 \u2013 May 10, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: Working with Dissociative Parts and Their Voices in Complex Trauma and Dissociative Disorders\nOverview:\nThis seminar focuses on adapting EMDR for individuals with dissociative disorders, using the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) Dolores has developed. It provides strategies for working with dissociative parts and their voices and integrating a trauma-informed approach to inner conflict safely from early treatment stages.\nKey Learning Points:\n\u00b7         Identifying and working with dissociative parts and their voices.\n\u00b7         Understanding the function and purpose of \u201chostile\u201d parts.\n\u00b7         Addressing dissociative phobias through EMDR informed techniques.\n\u00b7         Managing resistance and treatment impasses.\n\u00b7         Structuring work with dissociative parts effectively.\nProgram Description:\nAfter many early cautions about the potential dangers of using EMDR with individuals suffering from dissociative disorders, limited methods have been offered for adapting standard EMDR procedures to this specific population. Based on these early cautions, EMDR is still considered by many clinicians as limited to the treatment of traumatic memories in high-functioning dissociative clients and only after a long preparation phase that depends on other treatment modalities. Confined by this conceptualisation, the use of EMDR is too often limited, and many survivors of severe traumatisation are unable to benefit from EMDR reprocessing and, if at all, only much later in the treatment process.\nDolores Mosquera developed (with AnabelGonzalez, M.D.) the Progressive Approach model for treating complex trauma and dissociation (2012) and the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) (2019, 2025). Using this trauma and AIP-informed models, clinicians can safely utilise a wide range of EMDR interventions (including BLS) from early in the preparatory phase of treatment for patients with dissociative disorders.\nIn this seminar, she will present her current practice of working with clients, including video demonstrations. Mosquera's deft clinical skills and ground-breaking innovative thinking teach a middle ground between \"dissociation blind\" aggressive EMDR interventions and overly cautious delays to the use of EMDR reprocessing.\nMany dissociative clients have difficulty with hostile, critical voices. The internal conflict is sometimes so intense that the person even has difficulty carrying on an ordinary conversation. One factor that affects this conflict is how the patient deals with the voices or parts of the self.\nKey Program Content:\nIdentify the internal system of dissociation and internal voices that are hostile and critical\nHow to read the function and purpose behind the saboteur parts of self\nUsing compassion and understanding to help deal with dissociative phobias within the internal system\nSkills to reduce impasses and resistance that may complicate or reduce the efficacy of the treatment\nSpecific steps to organize the work with hostile parts and voices\n Days 2\u20133 \u2013 May 11\u201312, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: From Fragmentation to Integration: A Master Class in Treating Complex Trauma and Dissociation\nFormat: 2-Day Masterclass: Three Clinical Cases from Start to Finish\nAcross two days, Dolores will present three distinct new cases illustrating varying levels of dissociation \u2014 including one with frequent switching and no initial Adult Self. Each session is interactive, highlighting the therapeutic process from assessment to completion.\nOver two immersive days, this advanced master class offers a rare opportunity to observe and analyse complete therapeutic processes under the expert guidance of Dolores Mosquera.\n\nDolores will present three new and distinct clinical cases, each representing different manifestations of complex trauma and dissociation \u2014 including one client who experiences frequent switching and begins therapy without an integrated adult self.\nParticipants will follow these clients\u2019 journeys from the initial stages of therapy through to treatment completion, gaining deep insight into decision-making, pacing, and the integration of EMDR strategies within complex systems. The format is designed to be highly interactive and reflective, combining video demonstrations, live commentary, and group discussion to deepen understanding of safe, flexible, and attuned clinical practice when working with dissociative clients.\nThis master class is ideal for clinicians seeking to refine their skills, expand their conceptual framework, and enhance clinical confidence when navigating the challenges of trauma-related dissociation.\nAdditional Details\n\u00b7         Eligibility: Must have completed at least Part One of EMDR Basic Training (University of Otago or equivalent).\n\u00b7         Certification: Participants receive a Professional Development Certificate of Attendance.\n\u00b7         Dietary needs: Provided upon registration.\n\u00b7         Parking: Paid on-site parking available.\n\u00b7         Accommodation: Discounted rates at a local hotel (discount code to be posted on the event site).",

    "description": "Intro to Musical Improv | A PopRox Improv Course, Musical improv can be absolute magic. Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years. She directed One Night Band which won 'Most Original Production' at the Wellington Theatre Awards 2023, and performs regularly as both a player and musician for POPROX.\nISAAC THOMAS has been an improviser and improv musician for a decade in P\u014dneke and Whakat\u016b/Nelson. He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge.

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa.

That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. Over the years, Andre has come to value the power of sitting in circle\u2014of men coming together in honesty, vulnerability, and presence to witness and support one another. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 06:15 PM\nArrive to Bhakti Lounge\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:15 PM - 07:15 PM\nMen's Circle: Authentic Relating\nHost: Andre\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:15 PM - 08:15 PM\nOptional Plant-based dinner and dessert!\n\n\n",

Each month on Wednesday evenings Aisha will introduce us to a different technique for reviving our beloved textile pieces. If you're like us and have a box of clothing in need of repairs that never seems to empty... this is the club for you. With three events a month we'll inspire each other to creatively care for those pieces we love! This club is also perfect for anyone who loves learning new skills. Techniques we'll cover are lino printing, patching, darning, felting, embroidery, beading, sashiko, fabric painting and more! All materials and tools are supplied at each class - but you are welcome to bring your own. We highly encourage bringing those clothes or other textile items that need some love and repair.\n\nThere is no need to attend every class. We can catch you up on the skill at which ever class you choose to join us at. There are single class tickets or monthly sign ups available. Both of these have variable pricing options, unwaged/student, waged, and generous. Please choose whichever option feels right for you and your circumstances!\n\nIn August we are Lino Printing!\nClass 02: 20th August\nAt this class Aisha will take us through the process of designing and cutting our own lino to print with! You're welcome to keep going with the pre cut designs as well. Lino and carving tools will be supplied.\n\nClass 03: 27th August\nThis class will be open to what you want to work on! Bring in larger project items, print with the lino cuts you made in the previous week, or cut some fresh ones!\n\nIn September we are patching!\nClass 01: 10th September\nAisha will take us through the process of sewing on patches. Patches that we printed in the August classes will be available for this. You're welcome to bring your own patches as well. Please bring something that needs a patch up or a little bit of decoration.\n\nClass 02: 17th September\nAt this class we will learn how to appliqu\u00e9, the process of using scrap fabric to make decorative patches.

Inspired by bluegrass, Scottish folk music, and jazz performance practice, the tunes have a simplicity in common. Free improvised sections contrast carefully arranged melodies, allowing creativity and structure to coexist. The fiddle-esque melodies and straightforward harmonies create an open and inviting sound that changes depending on the musicians on stage. Performing this music as a group invites each member to paint their private imaginings, creating a unique collective folklore. The quartet will also perform a selection of tunes that inspired the music, including songs by Brian Blade, Gordon Lightfoot, and traditional melodies.\n\nAlex Trask \u2013 saxophone\nDuncan Haynes \u2013 piano\nElijah Mulheron \u2013 bass\nJohn Rae \u2013 drums",

    "description": "Made to bloom, exhibition by Josefine Gronkrans, We have a solo exhibition coming up from one of our ceramic artists Josefine Gronkrans\nThe opening night is 14th October, Tuesday at 5:30 pm\nVincents gallery : Willis St Village\n5/148 Willis St\nWellington\n14th October - 4th November\nPencil the date.\nNau mai haere mai.\nJosefine Gronkrans bio\nI'm a ceramicists from a rural part of Wellington who take inspiration from the beauty of Creation. I moved to beautiful Aotearoa from Sweden a few years ago, and my journey with ceramics started in 2023 and I've been elbows deep in clay ever since. I use flora found all over the world, and outside my doorsteps, to shape my artwork. My ceramic pieces are all hand made and no piece will be the other alike. I mainly throw a shape on the wheel and then let it tell me what it wants to become.\nThis exhibition is guided by Ecclesiastes 3:1-11. I think life is beautiful in it's times of joy, but also in the times of struggle, where we can grow and learn.\nA Time for Everything\nThere is a time for everything,\nand a season for every activity under the heavens:\na time to be born and a time to die,\na time to plant and a time to uproot,\na time to kill and a time to heal,\na time to tear down and a time to build,\na time to weep and a time to laugh,\na time to mourn and a time to dance,\na time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,\na time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,\na time to search and a time to give up,\na time to keep and a time to throw away,\na time to tear and a time to mend,\na time to be silent and a time to speak,\na time to love and a time to hate,\na time for war and a time for peace.\nWhat do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.\n",

John Campbell highlights some consistent themes of Brian Tamaki's Destiny Church: far-right prejudices, manifest anger, and hatred.\nIn Auckland on 21 June, Destiny Church organised a march to take \"a bold public stand for Christian values, Kiwi identity and the future of this nation\".\nOn Saturday, 13 September, Brian Tamaki attended the London \u201cUnite the Kingdom\u201d protest organised by far-right political activist Tommy Robinson that claimed to celebrate 'free speech', but also contained chants of hate, racist conspiracy theories, and Christian nationalist slogans. Among disturbing scenes, some people in the crowd ripped up a flag that read 'Secular Humanism'. To them, the very idea that people of all backgrounds and beliefs can live together with equality and respect is something to fear and destroy. For decades, the far right in the USA has painted humanism as a bogeyman, blaming it for liberal values, the rights of women, and the rights of LGBT people. It shows that those who thrive on fear are deliberately targeting the very values that underpin human rights and human dignity. Humanism is not a fringe or \u2018woke\u2019 idea. It is about fairness. It is about reason. It is about believing in the good that people are capable of when they are free to live their lives without fear or prejudice. These protests, which Brian Tamaki is supporting, are a show of force from those who wish to undo progress, to divide communities, and to undermine cherished freedoms.\nWe have a growing concern for secular values in our community. We cannot be silent. It is essential to keep compassion alive in public life and politics. After watching the documentary, we will discuss our concerns and how we might respond.\nTime: Oct 6, 2025 06:30 PM Auckland, Wellington\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/88183700512...\n",

    "description": "NZIFF: Twinless, A grieving brother finds an unlikely connection at a support group for siblings who have lost a twin, but his burgeoning bromance threatens to turn into something darker in this uncomfortably sharp-witted comedy.\n\nWhen his brother is suddenly killed in a car accident, estranged sibling Roman (Dylan O\u2019Brien) suffers the unique pain of being permanently severed from his twin. Inseparable in childhood, the brothers drifted apart as adults, brother Rocky (also O\u2019Brien) living out and proud in Portland while Roman lived a (decidedly hetero) tradie life in hometown Idaho. It seems he\u2019ll never have the chance to work through his complicated feelings towards his twin until stumbling upon a bereavement group for just such a purpose.\n\nThere he meets Dennis (James Sweeney). Neurotic, sarcastic, gay, he\u2019s the opposite that attracts as the pair bond over trauma and a deep need for attachment. They quickly become each other\u2019s emotional support twin-surrogate, on call for late night grocery trips, afterwork bitch sessions, and road trip singalongs. But odd couple bliss can\u2019t last, as Dennis has more than friendship in mind, Roman grapples with explosive anger issues, and dark secrets inevitably come to light.\n\nSweeny\u2019s sophomore effort as writer, director, and co-star walks an entertaining balance between discomfort and hilarity. With finely calibrated performances from both leads, Twinless is witty, warped, and surprisingly warm hearted. \u2014 Adrian Hatwell",

Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa.

    "description": "Towards modernism: The Walter Cook collection at Te Papa, Towards modernism: The Walter Cook collection at Te Papa\nCurator and author Justine Olsen will explore Te Papa\u2019s Walter C. Cook Collection of Decorative Arts. Walter intended to trace modernism\u2019s roots from the Arts and Crafts Movement to post-war designbut, but how did he achieve this aim?\n\nJoin us at the Library or online. Register for a Zoom link:\n\nModernism through the eyes of a collector\nBetween 1965 and 1990, collector Walter Cook built up an extensive collection of British and European decorative arts, mostly purchased in Wellington. In 1992 he gifted the collection to Te Papa, significantly adding to the museum\u2019s holdings of international decorative arts.\n\nIn the research for her book, Towards Modernism: The Walter Cook Collection at Te Papa, Justine Olsen drew on Turnbull and National Library collections, including the Wises Street Directories and Papers Past, to understand market trends through the flow of design from Europe to the market in New Zealand.\n\nIn this talk, Justine will explore the story of the market and changing taste, both at the time of production and half a century later, when these objects were sought after by dealers and collectors.\n\nThe Walter C. Cook Collection of Decorative Arts\nThe collection was built up over a twenty-five-year period by Walter Cook, a discerning and determined collector of modest means. The glass, ceramic, and metal objects \u2014 by designers including Susie Cooper, Clarice Cliff, William De Morgan, Christopher Dresser, and Inge-Lise Koefoed \u2014 track the evolution of design from the Arts and Crafts movement through to the British and European modernism of the 1970s.\n\nA Friends of the Turnbull Library event\nThe Friends of the Turnbull Library, Ng\u0101 Hoa o te Whare Pukapuka Turnbull, offers a monthly programme of free public talks. These talks are held in the National Library in Wellington and on Zoom. Some of these talks will be repeated in Auckland. The public programme highlights the work of researchers who draw on Turnbull material for their projects and staff who care for and research the collections.\n\nAbout the speaker\nJustine Olsen has been Curator of Decorative Art and Design at Te Papa Tongarewa the Museum of New Zealand, since 2009. Her special interests include late nineteenth and twentieth century design, and contemporary New Zealand craft especially ceramics and jewellery. With history curator Michael Fitzgerald, she developed the exhibition \u2018Walter Cook: a collector\u2019s quest\u2019 in 2012.\n\nImage: Justine Olsen, author of The Walter Cook Collection at Te Papa.\n\n",

By 1917 the system had grown and 17 was rebuilt into its current form adding a set of trucks converting the tram to 8 wheels. Tram tram saw regular service until the 1940\u2019s where it was eventually use for peak time travel, before being withdrawn in the late 50\u2019s.\nIt was then sold, and taken to Bell road in Raumati on the Kapiti coast where it served as a beach hutt until the 80\u2019s where it was donated to the Wellington tramway museum for display and eventual restoration.\n2014 a conservation and restoration plan was put together, and the tram was shipped out to the Wheelwright Shop in the Wairarapa for a full body overhaul. It was transported back to the museum in 2017 and put on public display until new trucks (wheelsets) could be manufacturedby A&G price in Thames.\nSince 2019 the tram has undergone new wiring, and extensive testing and running in and is now ready to take passengers along our museum.\nTram 17 is a wonderful achievement by all\nThose involved, and we cannot wait to welcome you this Father\u2019s Day to enjoy a ride on this heritage tram, saved from the scrap heap, and then saved again from rotting away.\nPlease note: We intend to run tram 17, however due to the nature and style of the tram, its operation is weather dependent.

    "description": "Dragonflies & Damselflies are Amazing and Important - Forest&bird Talk, Ruary Mackenzie Dodds and his wife Kari de Koenigswarter are rated as Dragonfly Ambassadors by the British Dragonfly Society. Although they have recently been involved in the setting up of a Dragonfly Hotspot at Exbury Gardens in Hampshire, England, their work currently centres on New Zealand where awareness of the significance of dragonflies is possibly behind that of the U.K, which has a growing understanding that dragonflies are a key indicator of the health of waterspaces. In this talk, Ruary takes his listeners back to basics on the amazing life-cycle of these insects. He outlines typical preferred dragonfly habitats, and touches on identification of New Zealand species. In addition to Ruary\u2019s talk, Kari\u2019s larva demonstration table shows actual examples of the larval stages on NZ species.\n\nIn their New Zealand work, Ruary and Kari are carrying out survey work on behalf of the Greater Wellington Regional Council, and are preparing a dragonfly education pack for schools. They have also carried out five summer seasons of night-filming an endemic dragonfly species \u2013 the Bush Giant \u2013 that lives in a burrow! A Radio New Zealand Our Changing World programme has been devoted to their work. (https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/ourchangingworld/546925/dragonflies-masters-of-flight).\n\nRuary and Kari have been working with dragonflies since 1985. They opened Europe\u2019s first Dragonfly Sanctuary in 1991, and founded the National Dragonfly Biomuseum in Northamptonshire in 1995. They and their team of volunteers continued work with the National Trust at Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire, and were instrumental in the setting up of the Dragonfly Centre there in 2009. Their adventures were published in Ruary\u2019s memoir, The Dragonfly Diaries (Saraband, 2014). Kari and Ruary have also published a how-to book, Dragonfly-Friendly Gardening (Saraband, 2024). Ruary is a Fellow of the Linnean Society. He has given talks in eight countries. He has appeared on both television and radio, and was awarded BBC Springwatch\u2019s \u2018Dragonfly Geek\u2019 award. He has been featured in BBC Wildlife Magazine, The Scottish Field, and in Wildlife Trust and National Trust publications. Kari specializes in the larval stages of odonate life, while \u2013 even after over forty years \u2013 Ruary\u2019s heart lifts at the sight of a dragonfly in flight, and he loves sharing this enthusiasm with his listeners!",

Sameena Zehra is back to explore whether it's time to dust off your guillotines (even for a pacifist, it\u2019s definitely time) with dark comedy and delicious storytelling that will make you gasp and guffaw as you channel your inner homicidal pacifist to pen a culling list of your own.\n\n\u201cAs a piece of political theatre, this is one of the more entertaining and potentially moving with a flair for the dramatic... a remarkable raconteur with amazing stories to tell\u2026\u201d - Nicholas Holm, The Post\n\nAudience care and considerations: This show is accessible to blind and low vision audiences without the need for audio description. The venue is fully accessible. Sameena may occasionally raise her voice, but won\u2019t shout. There is some direct audience interaction, but if you avert your gaze or shake your head, you will not be engaged directly. Contains adult themes, political and confrontational material, and coarse language.\n\nGeneral admission - choose your price: $8 - $100",

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Wellington will show you how.  \nMost Wellington homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nWellington has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Wellington.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Wellington is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

Samoan music teacher Mareta (Anapela Polataivao) is plunged into grief after losing her daughter in the Christchurch quakes. Mareta takes a relieving role at an elite private school, where she inspires her students to perform at a big choral competition. In the trailer Mareta faces a condescending interview at Saint Francis, and her growing relationship with \"spoiled, rich kids\" annoys a family member. Tin\u0101 was chosen to open the 2024 Hawai\u2019i International Film Festival.\n\nThe Guardian says \"It\u2019s a big-hearted tear-jerker about the power of art \u2013 and it\u2019s already breaking records in its home country, where it\u2019s received the widest-ever release for a local film and become the sixth-highest grossing New Zealand film of all time.\"\n\nThis film is rated M (contains violence, offensive language and suicide references).\n\n",

Everything that fuels her creative output is raw, authentic, sometimes weird, but always totally true self-expression. I Blow Out Big Candles is a strong statement of all of this and more. Down there, picking through the curious mix of sounds and feelings, from nostalgic, \u201890s-influenced and dreamy as well as eccentric and experimental, lives Freak Slug.\n\nThe 10-track project gives listeners a taste of what they will be in for at her Aotearoa shows, a journey of both soft soulfulness and sonic songwriting, all laid out on the table.",

    "description": "Carnival of Chaos, Myth, chaos, murder, alchemy, mystery, and devils are afoot in this four-night festival featuring six short retellings of classic works with strange new twists! We invite you to THEA 303\u2019s \u2018Carnival of Chaos\u2019 in Studio 77, premiering hybrid works from the House of Echoes (1 & 3 October): The Odyssey, Medea\u202fand\u202fThe Devil is a Lover, and the House of Secrets (2 & 4 October): Rope, The Taming of the Shrew\u202f and\u202f God\u2019s Gift.\n\nEach adaptation has been directed, designed, produced, choreographed and managed by the students.\n\nHouse of Echoes (Season A): Performs on the 1st and the 3rd of October\n\nThe Odyssey \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Homer\u2019s The Odyssey\nOdysseus just wants to get home to his true love, but the journey isn\u2019t exactly smooth. The streets after 2 a.m. and too many beers are alive with obstacles; cops are grumpy, goth girls are tempting, and the help of the Gods is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought. Betrayal, hurt, and anger push her to the edge making her act in ways she never thought she would. \u201cHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned.\u201d\n\nThe Devil is a Lover \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Love Labours Lost\u202fand Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Devil is an Ass\nSatan and two devils, Beelzebub and Pug, make a pact to travel to a 1920s speakeasy on Earth and abstain from corruption for 3 years. As the narrative combines absurdist actions with Shakespearean dialogue, the three devils quickly learn of the difficulties present in avoiding corruption and the effect their devilish meddling has on humanity.\n\nHouse of Secrets (Season B): Performs on the 2nd and 4th of October\n\nRope \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Patrick Hamilton\u2019s\u202fRope\u202f(1929)\nNot a\u202fwhodunnit, but a\u202fhowdoyahideit? Marion and Melanie are sure they\u2019ve committed the perfect murder by killing their friend Norman and hiding his body in a chest, a chest their select group of friends have been invited over to have a murder mystery games night around. It\u2019s foolproof, until the over analytical Constance comes to play\u2026\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew\nIn 1970's Aotearoa, sisters Katherina and Bianca find their love lives complicated by their father's order that one may not pursue romance unless the other follows suit. The sudden appearance of a charming factory owner and friend of Bianca's beau could mark a new hope for the two, but will this lead to an ocean of love or does something far more sinister lurk beneath the surface?\n\nGod\u2019s Gift \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Alchemist\nThe Carnival has come to town in 1615 London. Lovewit has gone to see the show, leaving her manor in the hands of Jeremy the Butler, the \u201cAlchemist,\u201d and Dol, a hardworking prostitute. Lovewit\u2019s house becomes a place for schemes, with ample opportunities to take money from foolish men. Will Dol be happy with her split of the money? Or will a surprise visitor shake things up?\n\nContent Forecast: mentions of and implied sexual violence and domestic abuse, mentions of drug use, strobe lighting, violence, coarse language, loud noises, haze, and smoke.",

This year, our train has reduced capacity, so be sure to book in quickly!\n\nHauled by our heritage locomotives, take a glimpse into the bygone era of train travel as we clear the rush of Wellington, racing through the suburbs of Petone, Lower Hutt & Upper Hutt. After picking up the last of our passengers at Upper Hutt, we will race through the 8.8km long Rimutaka tunnel.

There will be a lot of people for these buses, so please be patient. The bus transfer is free.\n\nHere you can pick your own daffodils for $5 (Cash Preferred) that is a fundraiser for Wellington Free Ambulance and Wh\u0101nau \u0100whina Plunket, Wairarapa region.

There\u2019s no expectation to speak \u2014 your presence alone is valued. The circle follows a respectful, non-judgmental format, prioritizing safety, confidentiality, and authenticity.\nOptional Plant-Based Dinner\nAfter the circle, stay for a wholesome plant-based dinner and dessert ($15). Sharing a meal is a simple way to extend the sense of community and connection. This gathering is offered on a non-profit basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us after this free event for an optional plant-based dinner and dessert for only $15 (or $5 for students).\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. Over the years, Andre has come to value the power of sitting in circle\u2014of men coming together in honesty, vulnerability, and presence to witness and support one another. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 06:15 PM\nArrive to Bhakti Lounge\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:15 PM - 07:15 PM\nMen's Circle: Authentic Relating\nHost: Andre\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:15 PM - 08:15 PM\nOptional Plant-based dinner and dessert!\n\n\n",

Since we will be viewing and discussing potentially sensitive topics, the event will have an Open Door Policy, which means that you may leave the venue any time, for any reason, and will not be judged for doing so.\nWHAT IS MARTIAL LAW?\n\"Martial law refers to the replacement of civil rule by military rule. This may be characterized by curfews, the dispensation of military tribunal rulings on civilians, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, which in Latin refers to \u201chaving the body\u201d, is a citizen\u2019s protection against unlawful imprisonment. This is suspended in times of crisis to expedite justice\" (Martial Law Museum).\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY?\nHuman rights violations and extrajudicial killings are still on-going in the Philippines under President Bongbong Marcos, the son of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. who proclaimed Martial Law in 1972, and Vice President Sara Duterte, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte who spearheaded the violent War on Drugs in 2016 (Karapatan).\nWHY WOULD I WANT TO JOIN THE FILM SCREENING?\nThe film screening is for anyone who is keen to learn about the Martial Law Era, wants to share their experience during the Martial Law (or something similar) through group discussion, wants to meet new people, wants to watch a Philippine film/documentary, or just wants to have snacks.\nI WANT TO JOIN BUT I'M FROM T\u0100MAKI MAKAURAU / CHRISTCHURCH / THE PHILIPPINES.\nWe will stream the film through Zoom for viewers outside Te Whanganui-a-Tara, however, there may be internet and other technical difficulties during the event itself.

    "description": "Mystery 35mm Movie Marathon, Details\nUPDATE - We have added some Half Marathon ticket options for those can't make the whole event. You can either select 'Daytime' or 'Evening' which will let you watch three features total. Daytime tickets are from 1:30pm until the dinner break (around 7:00pm). Evening are from the dinner break until the end of the last film.\n\nSurprise we are running a 35mm Mystery Marathon very soon! We have had some exciting news that we cannot share for now but as a result we must move our beautiful 35mm from its usual location into storage for a bit. We are not sure when it will be set back up so to celebrate we are running a marathon of six 35mm features across one Saturday!\n\nWe will kick off the first film at 1:30pm sharp on Saturday and will have a short dinner break after the third film. All going to plan we should be done by around 12:30am.\n\nIn terms of the features, we have films from the 1960s through to the early 2000s with a mix of comedies, sci-fi, horror and cult classics! Granted not all of these films would be considered masterpieces but there is nothing more fun than sitting in a crowd not knowing what could be coming next!\n\nWe will have a snack menu you can pre-order before the first film so aim to arrive around 1:00pm to order. The breaks between films will be very short (probably just enough time for the projectionist to thread up the next film) so make sure you come prepared for back-to-back screenings.\n\nThis event has strictly no digital projection, it\u2019s all film all the time. Now in theory it should all playback without a hitch as we are bringing in some of the best projectionist\u2019s Wellington has. But 35mm is a strange beast that can sometimes throw up the odd issue.\n\nFull marathon tickets (Admit) are $50\nHalf Marathon - Daytime are $30\nHalf Marathon - Evening are $30\n\nSeating is general admission and cinema entrance will be determined by earliest ticket purchase times.",

    "description": "NZIFF: Sentimental Value, This film may touch on the familiar theme of how artists draw from their own lives, but Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgard bring incredible tenderness to a story that is ultimately about what children and parents never say to one another \u2014 and whether those lifelong silences can ever be broken.\nCollaborating again with frequent co-writer Eskil Vogt (now also a successful director), Trier fashions a nuanced look at both a troubled family and a dysfunctional film industry. (Gustav\u2019s comeback project will be distributed through Netflix, and the divisive streamer is the target of a couple of the screenplay\u2019s better barbs.) Much of Sentimental Value takes place in the Borg family\u2019s home, and an efficient flashback, framed as an essay Nora wrote as a girl, explains how they have lived in the house for generations\u2026 That slightly fading family home becomes an apt metaphor for the weathered bond Nora, Agnes and Gustav share, although Reinsve\u2019s fragile performance articulates the festering resentment she feels toward her absent father.\nTrier\u2019s third picture to screen at Cannes, after 2021\u2019s The Worst Person In The World\u2019s breakout lead Reinsve won Best Actress, the reunion of director and star will entice arthouse crowds\u2026 and those seeking a smart, thoughtful tearjerker should be pleased with this sentimental but farfrom-mawkish film.\u201d \u2014 Tom Grierson, Screen Daily",

Inseparable in childhood, the brothers drifted apart as adults, brother Rocky (also O\u2019Brien) living out and proud in Portland while Roman lived a (decidedly hetero) tradie life in hometown Idaho. It seems he\u2019ll never have the chance to work through his complicated feelings towards his twin until stumbling upon a bereavement group for just such a purpose.\n\nThere he meets Dennis (James Sweeney). Neurotic, sarcastic, gay, he\u2019s the opposite that attracts as the pair bond over trauma and a deep need for attachment. They quickly become each other\u2019s emotional support twin-surrogate, on call for late night grocery trips, afterwork bitch sessions, and road trip singalongs.

Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor. This is despite his daughter being one of the pupils benefiting most from the free expression encouraged by Antonio\u2019s Freinet method teachings. Meanwhile, Ariadna teeters between hope and despair in her search for closure \u2013 a human vessel embodying the plight of a nation still wrestling with the consequences of a brutal conflict.\n\nThe closing credits remark that the remains of 12,000 people have been exhumed across the country. Like Ariadna, the film attempts to seek answers from the horrors of a war that took place almost a century ago \u2013 one driven by political sentiments that feel unsettlingly familiar as some of today\u2019s most powerful nations shift towards fascism. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

Distance and death became everyday realities for Kiwis at home \u2013 and caused griefs that were at times taboo and suppressed.\n\nDame Gaylene Preston frames seven women, including her own mother, against a black background that creates a stage for their candid, unadorned and surprisingly intimate wartime recollections, as they look back from the 90s in interviews conducted by oral historian Judith Fyfe. The acclaimed documentary, which combines these shared testimonies with personal photographs and newsreel clips, conveys the immense pressure to conform to the value of stoic sacrifice for the cause under the scrutinising eye of neighbours, and reveals lesser-seen layers of resilience.\n\nMarriages in the first flush of romance were cut short, pregnancies were navigated alone, conscientious objectors were met with ostracisation and American servicemen scorned, in a nation united around support of their boys in combat overseas \u2013 a state of affairs in which women were often granted little voice, as they took on more labour, and absorbed life-changing losses. \u2014 Carmen Gray",

    "description": "NZIFF: What Marielle Knows, Panic around a new digital Big Brother era underpins a clever, absurdist send-up of bourgeois hypocrisy, as a married couple are put on the spot by their daughter\u2019s all-pervasive telepathy.\n\nGermany has a thorny history with mass intelligence gathering, and a continued vigilance around data privacy \u2013 and anxiety. Director Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hambalek taps into it with satirical, ribald flair and a twist of the fantastical in a sharp domestic parable for a new era of global surveillance paranoia.\n\nJulia (Julia Jentsch) is precariously close to a full-blown affair with the workmate she flirts with on smoking breaks. Her husband Tobias (Felix Kramer) dreams of getting even with a publishing house colleague who undercuts his authority in editorial design meetings. When their teenager Marielle (Laeni Geiseler) is slapped by a school friend over an insult, the impact leaves her with the sudden telepathic ability to see everything her parents do throughout the day \u2013 a development that spells disaster for the household, as dishonesty can no longer sustain the veneer of stable marital contentment.\n\nAs the family descends into a desperate, riotous war of manipulation, they must experiment with new moral codes. Is radical honesty and defiance the best course of action, or should they stifle egos and instincts in line with their preferred image? Better yet, can Marielle\u2019s new powers be curbed? \u2014 Carmen Gray",

Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.\nAs Glinda\u2019s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba\u2019s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives.\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

She had just turned 37. Two frenetic months later, she was Prime Minister. Just before the final vote was in, she discovered she was pregnant. She would become only the second head of state in history to give birth while in office.\nArdern quickly became one of the most recognisable leaders in the world. She drew global attention from people craving a sensitive and compassionate approach to the critical issues of our time. In private, she struggled with being a mother and proving herself to a public skeptical of women\u2019s leadership. A series of crises - the Christchurch massacre, pandemic lockdowns, and disinformation-fueled protests outside Parliament - would test that leadership and the feminine touch she brought to it. She resigned from office in January 2023, shocking her supporters and critics alike.\nGoing behind the scenes of her administration and her private life, Prime Minister follows Jacinda for seven years as she is catapulted to the top of New Zealand politics, becomes a feminist political icon, resigns suddenly from office and continues to champion the fight against isolationism, fear, and the distortion of truth. Intimate home footage shot by her husband and audio interviews that Jacinda did while in office give us unparalleled access. Along with in-depth contemporaneous interviews, these form the emotional backbone of the story, giving viewers an unfiltered window into her years in power.\n\nAll profits from this movie fundraiser go to the Lower Hutt Foodbank.",

You may leave the venue at any time, for any reason, and will not be judged for doing so.\nABOUT THE DOCUMENTARY FILM:\n\"Jazz and decolonisation are entwined in this historical rollercoaster, that rewrites the Cold War episode that led musicians Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach to crash the UN Security Council, in protest against the murder of Patrice Lumumba.\"\nWHAT IS CONGO WEEK?\nCongo Week is on 19-25 October, where we commemorate the millions of lives lost in this ongoing genocide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It is also a time to celebrate the enormous humanity and environmental potential the beautiful country DRC has.\nWHY ARE WE HOSTING THIS IN TE WHANGANUI-A-TARA, AOTEAROA (WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND)?\nWe are holding community film screenings during Congo Week to talk to each other as a community, and to help each other learn. As we support other causes/issues in Aotearoa/NZ and worldwide, we would like to increase solidarity for Congolese people.\nWe are buying, consuming, and benefitting from tech products/AI usage through child slavery and genocide of Congo. As long as there are customers of minerals found in the DRC, corporations will have an incentive to continue exploiting Congolese people for these minerals to be used in jewellery, batteries, e-cigarettes, and tech products like our phones and computers.\nHOW MUCH IS THE TICKET?\nThe film screening is free but we appreciate koha for the Panzi Foundation (more info below).\nWHY WOULD I WANT TO JOIN THE FILM SCREENING?\nThe film screening is for anyone keen to learn/watch a documentary film, wants to share their experience through optional group discussion, or wants to meet new people.\nThis event welcomes people from all walks of life who are willing to learn, listen, or contribute (LGBTQ+ friendly).\nBetween 5pm and 6pm: Set up tables and chairs\n6pm-6:15pm: Karakia, health and safety, organisers' introductions, brief explanation on Congo Week\n6:15pm-8:30pm: \"Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat\" screening (people can come and go at any time)\n8:30pm-8:45pm: Break/moment of silence\n8:45pm-9:45pm: Group discussion with optional participation (each person to say their thoughts for 3 mins or less)\n9:45pm-10pm: Pack down chairs and leave the room tidy\nWILL THERE BE MORE IN-PERSON/VIRTUAL FILM SCREENINGS IN THE FUTURE?\nYes, will most likely be in 2026 instead of this year.

    "description": "Folk B*tch Trio - Wellington, Folk Bitch Trio - 'Now Would Be A Good Time' Album Tour with special guest Georgia Knight\n\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories. Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology",

You may leave the venue at any time, for any reason, and will not be judged for doing so.\nABOUT THE DOCUMENTARY FILM:\n\"A whistle-blower, a patriotic military commander, a mineral dealer, and a displaced tailor share a glimpse of life amid Africa's longest continuing conflict.\"\nWHAT IS CONGO WEEK?\nCongo Week is on 19-25 October, where we commemorate the millions of lives lost in this ongoing genocide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It is also a time to celebrate the enormous humanity and environmental potential the beautiful country DRC has.\nWHY ARE WE HOSTING THIS IN TE WHANGANUI-A-TARA, AOTEAROA (WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND)?\nWe are holding community film screenings during Congo Week to talk to each other as a community, and to help each other learn. As we support other causes/issues in Aotearoa/NZ and worldwide, we would like to increase solidarity for Congolese people.\nWe are buying, consuming, and benefitting from tech products/AI usage through child slavery and genocide of Congo. As long as there are customers of minerals found in the DRC, corporations will have an incentive to continue exploiting Congolese people for these minerals to be used in jewellery, batteries, e-cigarettes, and tech products like our phones and computers.\nHOW MUCH IS THE TICKET?\nThe film screening is free but we appreciate koha for the Panzi Foundation (more info below).\nWHY WOULD I WANT TO JOIN THE FILM SCREENING?\nThe film screening is for anyone keen to learn/watch a documentary film, wants to share their experience through optional group discussion, or wants to meet new people.\nThis event welcomes people from all walks of life who are willing to learn, listen, or contribute (LGBTQ+ friendly).\nBefore 7:45pm: Set up\n7:45-8pm: Karakia, health and safety, organisers' introductions, brief explanation on Congo Week\n8pm-9:30pm: \"This Is Congo\" screening (people can come and go at any time)\n9:30pm-9:40pm: Moment of silence/meditation\n9:40pm-10pm: Quick group discussion with optional participation (TBC if we can extend)\nBy 10pm: Pack down\nWILL THERE BE MORE IN-PERSON/VIRTUAL FILM SCREENINGS IN THE FUTURE?\nYes, will most likely be in 2026 instead of this year.

HOW CAN I SUPPORT?\nPlease spread the word via social media stories, reposting, wheatpasting, or sharing to people who don't use social media (Instagram post here).\nIf you click RSVP, there is an option to donate without getting a ticket.

Rape is a weapon of war used against the Congolese people.\nThe Panzi Foundation is one of the largest African-led nonprofits and is committed to addressing the devastating impacts of sexual and gender based violence through a holistic, survivor-centred approach.\nThe Panzi Foundation was founded by Dr. Denis Mukwege, who is considered one of the leading experts in injuries of rape and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2018, 6 years after an assassination attempt on his life.\nWHO ARE THE EVENT ORGANISERS?\nThis event is organised by ordinary community members affiliated with Te Tai-T\u0113t\u0113kura (an indigenous, youth-led group in Aotearoa/NZ).\nTe Tai-T\u0113t\u0113kura is founded on the principles of revolution through education and restoration of power to the people. They hold a foundational community-based kaupapa that prioritises uplifting, connecting, and empowering our communities.\nTe Tai-T\u0113t\u0113kura's founding is based on the socialist and revolutionary politics of the Black Panther Party, which rose to prominence during the Black Power Movement in the U.S. They combine the Black Panther Party's ideas with Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and their own landback and decolonisation principles.\nThrough community initiatives, Te Tai-T\u0113t\u0113kura shows the people that we as a community can take care of our society.\nWe stand in solidarity with indigenous peoples in Aotearoa/NZ, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and across the world facing injustice.\nPlease click \"Contact host\" if you have questions/feedback/concerns or if you can't attend anymore.",

Dr Barrie has recently revamped the Glendronach lineup, and we're going to see how she's doing: we'll try the previous 12 and 15 year--old bottlings against her new releases. She's worked her magic at Ben Riach, and we'll see how she's doing at Glendronach (I suspect quite well!). Additionally, we'll try the highland peated Glendronach, a departure from the familiar smokey peat of Islay. We'll expect a sweeter, softer style, bolstered by some sherry maturation.\nPlease join me for this wonderful tasting of Glendronachs:\nTuesday, September 9\n7:30pm Start time (arrive early to get a beer and a seat)\n$60 per person\nSeatoun Clubhouse (16 Dundas Street, Seatoun)\nSee you then,\nMatt\nMatt & the Clubhouse Team\n\n*** Please note you need to be a member or a guest of a member to attend.

In the late 1800s, small numbers of Chinese settled in Samoa and became part of a growing multicultural community. There they influenced local customs, made an enduring contribution to Samoan cuisine introducing contemporary favourites such as sapasui (chop suey), keke pua\u2018a (pork buns) and of course laisa (rice). \r\n\r\nDragons celebrate this cultural and culinary fusion by showcasing these favourites and presenting new dishes highlighting the shared love of culinary staples such as taro and noodles, rice, fish, and pork, the magnificent spectrum of Chinese herbs, spices and flavours. Through cooking and sharing food together the chefs honour their culinary heritage, strengthen our connections to one another and celebrate the big and little moments in life. This is a shared-style meal, served banquet style on lazy Susan turntables. \r\nDragons is My Uso was one of the sell-out hits of the 2024 festival - don't miss out!\r\n\r\nDiscounted tables for 10 available for $1000, so get the whole aiga together!",

Guests get a front-row seat to the action, while supporting a truly game-changing enterprise.\r\n\r\n4 August \u2014 Jessie Gibberd, Loretta\r\nOriginally from rural Waikato, Jessie Gibberd made the move to Wellington to study, but it was the buzz of hospitality that captured her heart.

From there, he headed to Queenstown, learning from a wide range of chefs and kitchen styles before challenging himself with a move to Wellington.

Cosgrave works to find intentional reticence through the alteration of collected and personal archive imagery. Erasing, saturating and muddying with a refined sense of surface and delicate use of colour, arriving eventually to a space that grants us momentary reflection on the ordinary rhythms of daily life.\nA short story by Lucy Clara accompanies the show.\nOpening Friday, 26 September at 5pm \u2013 kindly sponsored by Duncan\u2019s Brewing, Almighty and The Garden Table.

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing.

Yet, despite its growing prominence, the conceptual boundaries of this form of cooperation remain underdeveloped. This seminar addresses this gap by proposing a comparative framework that distinguishes minilateralism from other established modes of cooperation\u2014not only bilateralism and multilateralism, but also plurilateralism and regionalism. Through this analytical distinction, the study clarifies the conceptual contours of minilateralism and illuminates its purposive and exclusive character. By advancing a sharper theoretical understanding, this research contributes to the conceptual lexicon of international relations and enhances our grasp of cooperation dynamics in the Indo-Pacific.\n Mr Ryosuke Hanada is a PhD candidate and Sessional Teaching Staff at the School of International Studies, Macquarie University. He was a Research Fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs (JIIA), researching Japan\u2019s foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific region from 2016 to 2020. He experienced several fellowship programs, including the Japan-US Partnership Program of the Research Institute of Peace and Security (RIPS), Young Strategist Forum of the German Marshall Fund (GMF), Strategic Japan Program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Indo-Pacific Fellow of the Perth USAsia Centre, and Raisina Young Fellow of Observer Research Foundation (ORF) in India.

    "description": "Porirua Parkrun, What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

    "description": "Treasury Guest Lecture with Michael Keen: IN-PERSON attendance, Join us for our special Fiscal Policy for the Future seminar\nNew Zealand faces significant long-term fiscal challenges, including the rising costs associated with an ageing population, increasing demand for public services, and the need to adapt to a changing global economy. These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand. The Trust was established to support leading tax policy thinking in New Zealand. You can read about the Trust\u2019s work here.\nAbout the presenter\nMichael (Mick) Keen is a former Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, where for over twenty years he played a central role in shaping and delivering IMF policies and advice on tax matters.\nHe has advised finance ministries in all parts of the world, including missions to over forty countries, and led the preparation of influential papers for the G20 and the Executive Board of the IMF.\nBefore joining the Fund, Mick was Professor of Economics at the universities of Essex (UK), Queens (Canada) and Kyoto, and is now Ushioda Fellow at the University of Tokyo.\nMick was the keynote speaker at the 2014 conference on the Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand and has provided peer review for Inland Revenue\u2019s previous Long-Term Insights Briefing.\nMick has jointly authored, with Joel Slemrod, Rebellion, Rascals and Revenue \u2013 an entertaining account of how history illuminates the perennial challenges and timeless principles of taxation\u2014and how the past holds clues to solving the tax problems of today.\nAbout this seminar series\nNew ideas, innovative concepts, research evidence and expert advice are all crucial to stimulate and inform the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis and advice. Our current theme for guest lectures - Fiscal Policy for the Future - explores the role of stabilising, sustainable and effective fiscal policy. Speakers provide insights into how fiscal policy can be designed to support government to meet its current and future objectives and obligations while adapting to changing circumstances and delivering value to the New Zealand public.\nFiscal policy has a stabilising role in helping to smooth the business cycle, while sustainability in fiscal policy is foundational for resilience to both shocks and longstanding challenges, such as climate change, technological advancements, and demographic trends. Ensuring effective and value for money expenditure is important so that fiscal policy contributes to the living standards of New Zealanders, both now and in the future.\nPlease note that the views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series are those of the individual presenters. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the New Zealand Treasury or the New Zealand Government.\nFor updates and our latest research visit: www.treasury.govt.nz\nKeep in touch\nIf you would like to be the first to hear about our upcoming events in the Treasury Guest Lecture Series, please SUBSCRIBE to stay up to date.",

    "description": "CBT skills for physical health practitioners in Aotearoa New Zealand, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention initially developed for emotional disorders. It is now widely used in supporting people to deal with the challenges of physical ill-health. Professionals from various backgrounds can learn to use a simplified CBT skills set, and use of these skills enables them to be more effective in managing aspects of their patients\u2019 distress.\nThe training is a mix of theory, skills demonstration and skills practice, giving participants a better understanding of the applicability of the skill set in their area of practice and providing some skills to take away. Training sessions are spaced to allow participants to use their new skills in their clinical practice. Each participant reflects on their learning and their work with a specific patient, and the whole group reflects on lessons learned. In this way, learning remains rooted in participants\u2019 clinical practice. These CBT courses are consistently evaluated highly by participants.\nThe Course\nTeaching will be commenced with 2 days of in person sessions. 19th and 20th Feb 2026 at Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington and subsequently 2 sessions on-line via Zoom. These will be either 18th or 19th March an 22nd or 23rd April 2026.\nAttendance at all sessions is mandatory to complete the course.\nThe courses cost is $850 per person (incl GST).\nThe Trainers\nKathy Burn was a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Palliative Care who went on to train in CBT and to develop the CBT service at St Christopher\u2019s Hospice, London. She now works in CBT in chronic pain, and she teaches and supervises CBT trainees at the institute of Psychiatry, London.\nKathryn Mannix was a Palliative Medicine Consultant and CBT therapist. She developed \u2018CBT First Aid\u2019 to enable palliative care clinicians to adapt skills from CBT into their clinical practice. She is an author. There are insights into her use of CBT in her books With the End in Mind and Listen.\nTerms and Conditions\nAttendance: In order to create a learning community for each course, it is important that each person on a course attends every session and is able to join in the discussions by keeping up with the course. By accepting a place on a particular course, you agree to attend all the sessions, to arrive on time, and to work alongside your group members during the session to support each other's learning. Each session builds on the last, and you'll be asked to put your new learning into practice in- between sessions. Building learning groups in this way means we can't add new trainees after a course has begun.\nWe are not able to run catch-up sessions for sessions missed. If you miss sessions, you may be asked to withdraw from the course and no refunds will be given.\nRefunds/Canellations: Once you sign up and pay, we won't be able to refund your payment unless we can reallocate your place to another person before the course begins. The deadline for cancelling your place is 28 days before the day and time of the first session. If you cancel and we can fill your place with another person, we'll offer you the choice of a refund or a place on a future course, if places are available. We will do our best to fill your place, but we can't promise this. Refunds will incur an administration fee.\nDates and Times of Sessions: all dates and times are given in NZ time, and this varies over the year. It is up to you to check the correct time in your time zone: you may find this website useful to check your own time zone with Auckland NZ time on each specific date: https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/\nTrainers: we have a team of trainers, all of whom are experienced CBT therapists and trainers, and all are familiar with applying CBT in physical health settings. Different sessions may be taught by different trainers, or by 'guest appearances' by some of our team. The team of trainers will ensure there is continuity of content and of learning as the course progresses.\nSpecial circumstances: Sometimes, life events appear unexpectedly. If something unexpected prevents you from attending, please let us know as early as you can, and we will give consideration to how we might be able to support you to continue your training if that is what you wish to do.",

My love is supporting people to feel good in their bodies and to remember that health can be both deeply healing and beautifully simple.\n\n\nAbout Kae-Lynn\nHello I\u2019m Kae-Lynn!\n\nI lead The Movement because, I believe everyone deserves a non judgmental space to catch their breath and, be reminded of their spark.\n\nWhen Mel first shared The Movement with me I was so I was burnt out, numb, and deeply disconnected. I was busy trying to love and please everyone else that I completely lost myself.\n\nDuring my first class something shifted. The music \u2014 the movements \u2014 Reminded me of that spark within me. It felt like my soul finally had permission to shine again. For that one hour, I could breathe. No pressure, no expectations, no noise from the world or my mind. Just movement, music, and freedom to be me.\n\nI believe fitness should be intentional, empowering and fun.\n\nCome give it a go!\n\n",

That\u2019s why I created this workshop.\n\nThis is a beginner-friendly, educational session focused on index fund investing\u2014what it is, how it works, and how to actually get started. I\u2019ll walk you through the full process: from understanding the basics to setting up your accounts, learning the key jargon, and knowing how to choose a fund that fits you.\n\nWe\u2019ll cover important things like fees, tax, coverage, hedging, and more\u2014things most people overlook when they first start. It\u2019s not just theory. You\u2019ll leave with a clear understanding of what to look for and how to take action confidently.\n\nI\u2019m not a financial adviser\u2014this isn\u2019t personal advice. It\u2019s everything I wish someone had explained to me earlier. Because when you understand the process and use a simple strategy like dollar-cost averaging, you really can set yourself up for the long term.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never invested before or just want to finally make sense of it all, this workshop is for you.",

(Burst blood vessels in the brain).\n-Blood thinning medication. (Unfortunately, the blood thinners used to prevent such blood clots can increase the risk of bleeding in the brain, a cause of hemorrhagic stroke).\n-Pregnancy or possible pregnancy\n-Asthma\n-Mental Contraindications\n-Substance dependence & addiction (Deep breathwork journeys are not always appropriate for those who are still addicted to a substance, as it tends to raise suppressed or repressed material for processing. However, if you\u2019re currently in recovery, this can be extremely healing, and help you discover the deeper patterns that gave rise to this addiction. (Grof, 1985: 267 \u2013 268).\n-Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or psychosis\n-Hospitalisation for emotional crises in the last 10 years\n-Psychological conditions and diagnoses, which preclude safe emotional release.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the above, please inform Sarah.\n\n*Tickets are non-refundable, but are transferrable with 24 hours notice required.\n\n",

    "description": "Inner infrastructure for Outer Resilience, In times of polycrisis and uncertainty, more people are coming around to the need not for more information, but for integration and presence.\nThis 90-minute session offers a safe, grounded space to slow down, reconnect with ourselves, and explore the inner terrain of change-making, and of our relational space.\nAs Rumi reminds us: \u201cYesterday I was clever and tried to change the world; today I am wise and am changing myself.\u201d\nBuilding our inner infrastructure - our relationship with self, with our feelings, with others and with nature - is foundational to how we show up in the world.\nWe will begin by discussing research into how distraction or numbing our discomfort is an intelligent and common short-term survival strategy, but in fact is one which limits our long-term capacity to connect, lead and evolve. We will then guide participants in somatic practices to offer accessible ways to reconnect with your agency.\nDuring this session, you will gain tools to increase your inner awareness, expand your bandwidth of awareness, and integrate emotion, sensation, and story. Together we\u2019ll explore the role of perception in our orientation to life and the choices we make, how our narratives can connect us with our agency, the power of curiosity, and dive into how our relational presence can often have more impact than our opinions.\nThis session is an invitation to restore connection, calm, and courage, to become more whole, more fully human, and more ready for what this moment is asking of us.\nAbout your host\nFreda is a curator, engagement practitioner, and connector, who works at the intersection of social change, community-building, and inner development. She is the Founder of the Goodlife Collective, which curates spaces that build connection, wellbeing and collective wisdom.\nDrawing on yoga teaching, somatic practices and adult development, Freda is interested in how we build our inner infrastructure - the capacity to work through discomfort, reconnect with our agency, and bring greater presence to relationships. Her background is in psychology, environmental-science and design, and she loves nerding out on ideas and conversations about unlocking our collective potential.",

    "description": "Katie Knowles PAM, Title:\nSelf-Disclosure of Sexual Dysfunction to Romantic Partners.\n\nAbstract:\nSexual dysfunctions (e.g., distress about levels of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain) are linked with poorer individual and relational wellbeing. Disclosing these dysfunctions to a romantic partner helps to mitigate these effects, however, such disclosures also risk rejection or relationship conflict. Existing models of disclosure do not adequately capture the complexities of disclosing sexual dysfunction, such as how costs and benefits are weighed simultaneously, the role of contextual factors, or how partner responses shape future disclosures. Three studies test a model of people\u2019s disclosure of sexual dysfunction. Study 1 reports a thematic analysis of people\u2019s social scripts about disclosing sexual dysfunction. Subsequent studies will test the influence of positive and negative partner responses and develop a scale to measure the anticipated costs and benefits of disclosing dysfunctions. Altogether, these studies build a framework explaining how and when people will disclose sexual dysfunction to romantic partners.\nPrimary supervisor: Dr Matt Hammond\nSecond supervisor: Dr Ally Gibson\nStaff and postgraduate students are cordially invited to attend. There will be an opportunity at the end of the presentation for audience to observe the panel questioning the candidate about the presentation and proposed research, and for audience members themselves to ask questions of the candidate.\n",

Free from societal expectations of stoicism or self-sufficiency. Through open sharing and mutual support, participants are empowered to build resilience, self-reflection, and a stronger sense of identity and purpose.\nStructure of the Circle\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.A short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center.

That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 05:45 PM\nArrive to Bhakti Lounge\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:45 PM - 07:15 PM\nMen's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\nHost: Andre\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:15 PM - 08:15 PM\nPlant-based dinner and dessert!\n\n\n",

This workshop draws from ancient and time-tested wisdom found in yoga philosophy \u2014 especially the Bhagavad Gita \u2014 to explore how anxiety and inner conflict can become turning points for insight and conscious action.\nRather than avoiding or suppressing discomfort, the Gita offers a way to meet it \u2014 with clarity, honesty, and meaningful direction. Through a blend of philosophical reflection and grounded tools, we\u2019ll explore how to steady the mind and reconnect with deeper purpose in the face of pressure or doubt.\n\n\nMeet your host, Sivananda\nSivananda\u2019s background is in both science and music, holding a Master's Degree in Data Science, a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a long history of playing and performing on the double bass. His passion for philosophy, music, good food and community attracted him to the bhakti lifestyle. Having studied and practiced the science of the \u2018self\u2019 for six years now, he thrives on drawing insights from contemporary science and combining it with yoga wisdom to encourage others to explore new perspectives.\n6.15pm Tuesday 19th August\nEnd the session on a high note with a delicious plant-based dinner, dessert, and good conversation.\nTickets available here~ bit.ly/eventTickets\nBhakti Lounge 1/175 Vivian Street, Te Aro, Wellington. http://www.bhaktilounge.org.nz ",

    "description": "Sapphic Somatics: A Queer Embodiment Workshop, Somatic: Of or relating to the body, particularly the perception of physical sensations and internal experiences\n\nWhat does it feel like to exist in a queer body? This workshop aims to help sapphic women and gender minorities find joy, freedom, and connection through somatic exercises that help you embody and embrace your queerness. You will leave feeling confident in your ability to take up space, tapped into your self-expression, and connected to the experiences of your sapphic community.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of what to expect:\n- Opening Exercise: Guided somatic movements to loosen up your body\n- Community Connection: Rotating conversations with other participants about queer embodiment\n- Yoga Flow: Creative 30 minute class to explore presence and connect to your self-expression\n- Guided Meditation: A relaxing combination of breathwork and visualisation to cultivate safety in your body\n- Closing Connection: Gentle and grounding partner stretches (optional) and group reflections\n\nNo prior experience with yoga or somatic exercises necessary! All you need to attend is an open attitude, a desire to connect with your body, and a willingness to share your experience with other sapphics. Yoga mats and all other props will be provided. While this workshop dives into your embodied expression of sapphic identity/sexuality, none of the content is sexual in nature and the small amount of physical touch with other participants is completely optional.\n\nThe workshop is facilitated by Megan Edwards, creator of Golden Hour Gigs and a 500CYT trauma-informed yoga teacher. This event is intended specifically for queer women and gender minorities. No TERFS no SWERFS.\n\nContent consideration: Because this workshop focuses on finding joy/pleasure/freedom in your body, it might not be suited for anyone experiencing intense dysphoria. With that said, you are welcome to explore discomfort and work on integrating challenging feelings. Megan is trained in movement techniques to lead you away from anything too activating and help you find safety in your body.\n\nAccessibility: Awhi Yoga Studios has an elevator and is wheelchair accessible. There are plenty of gender neutral bathrooms and cosy spaces to rest if you need a break from the workshop at any time. If you want to attend but are concerned about the level of movement required, please email the organiser with any mobility questions at goldenhourgigz@gmail.com",

However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan.

Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing.

An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based.

It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages.

    "description": "Teaching Well - Supportive schools for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), With the growing emphasis on staff wellbeing there is a plethora of workplace mental wellbeing programmes on offer. However what is meant by staff wellbeing is not often clearly defined, with many programmes focusing on work related 'stressors' for staff or using staff wellness approach.  \nAs part of a well school, it is just essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Take the opportunity to learn the underlying principles of wellbeing that inform a sustainable and impactful staff wellbeing plan.  \nDesigned specifically for the school context, the workshop examines the theory and the practice of promoting wellbeing through the lens of of being part of a school staff in 2025.\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nEquipping individual staff members skills or resources to cope more effectively with the stressful or distressing aspects of their jobs or providing an employee assistance programme is only one aspect of a comprehensive staff wellbeing plan. It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan. Learn the difference between welfare, wellness and wellbeing approaches and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. \n\nMeta-evaluations of workplace mental wellbeing programmes indicate that there is little evidence around the efficacy of many workplace wellbeing programmes because they do not address the organisational and systemic factors that act as either enablers of or obstacles to wellbeing. Just as it is recognised that supportive environments are foundational to wellbeing of students, so is it also for a well staff. An effective staff wellbeing programmes responds to the needs of the staff and reflects the cultural make-up of the staff, the values and character of the school. \nDrawing on collective impact and transformational change theory and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, a conceptual model will be introduced that outlines the eight pou on which a staff wellbeing plan should be based. The strength of this model is that it settings or occupation specific. It requires a depth analysis of the nature, dynamics and demands of the work and the inter-relationships that occur in the work\nBuilding of the learnings from previous workshops and feedback from participants, the workshop now offers a template to guide the development of a staff wellbeing plan\nIf you are wanting a workshop that will give you a pre-packaged wellbeing programme, then this workshop is not for you. Countless evaluations have shown the limited efficacy of wellbeing programmes that are \"inserted\" into a school. A staff wellbeing plan must grounded in and responsive to the learnings made out of the reflective analysis and staff consultation stages. In fact, the staff consultation is, in itself, is a wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 30% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions. Post workshop consulting services such as mentoring the development of or reviewing a staff wellbeing plan can also be provided.\nPost Workshop Consult:\nSchools and Kuras have the option of a 90 minute consult with Barry in 2026 to review their staff wellbeing plan.\nBarry has worked in mental wellbeing promotion and suicide prevention/postvention for 36 years at the local, national and international levels.  His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs. \nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.

Matariki is also visible at this time close to the line of planets.\nCome down to the Wellington waterfront at dawn and see the planets Pare\u0101rau (Saturn), K\u014dp\u016b/T\u0101wera (Venus), Hine-i-t\u012bweka (Jupiter), Whiro (Mercury), and Matariki (Pleiades) in our skies.

    "description": "Wairarapa Walking Festival 2025: Walk in the Dark Carterton, This session is held at the Carterton Golf Course.\n\nStep into the beauty of the night with this unique new offering for the Wairarapa Walking Festival. Hosted on the manicured grounds of a local golf course, this gentle evening stroll allows you to experience the magic of darkness without worrying about uneven paddocks or rough terrain.\n\nAs we walk together, the transition from dusk to dark will naturally unfold, helping us acclimatise to the night. For those new to walking in the dark, handy red-light torches will be provided to keep you comfortable. This is less about distance and more about slowing down, stepping slightly outside of your comfort zone, and embracing the calm of night.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll reflect on the value of darkness - its role in history, its impact on wellbeing, and its importance for the environment. We\u2019ll then pause to share hot chocolate and, if the skies are clear, look up in awe at a canopy of stars. With star charts in hand, we\u2019ll explore what the November night skies have to offer and why protecting them matters.\n\nThe evening concludes with simple, practical ways we can all help preserve our night skies - because our environment doesn\u2019t end at the treetops, it stretches all the way to the stars.\n\nPhoto credits: Jet Productions",

    "description": "Bar Crossing Seminar - Manawat\u016b (Foxton bar), Crossing A Bar? We Can Help\nBar crossings can be one of the trickiest, and riskiest parts of boating in Aotearoa. They change fast, they don\u2019t always play nice, and they\u2019ve caught out even the most experienced skippers. Each year, we see serious incidents and tragedies happening on our bars, so it\u2019s super important to know your stuff before you head out.\nThat\u2019s where we come in. Join us at Manawatu Marine Boating Club for a free and relaxed seminar. You\u2019ll hear straight from local Coastguard skippers and boating legends who\u2019ll share their real-world tips, local knowledge, and a few stories from the water.\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover (and chat about):\n\nUnderstanding the local features of your bar\nReading and interpreting the conditions when planning a trip\nGetting your boat and your crew bar crossing ready\nHow to handle your boat while crossing\nHow to do a bar crossing report (and why it\u2019s worth it)\nWhat to do if things go pear-shaped\nIt\u2019s interactive \u2013 so bring your questions, share your own experiences, and have a yarn with others in the boating community.\nBring your mates too \u2013 whether they\u2019re brand new to boating or have been around since the days of paper charts and handheld compasses, there\u2019s something in here that could save a trip\u2026 or a life.\n Why it matters:\nIn 2024, 23% of craft-related drownings happened during bar crossings.\n5 lives were lost due to capsizing while crossing a bar.\nOlder blokes are still the most at-risk \u2013 but everyone can make safer choices with the right knowledge (and a lifejacket on).",

    "description": "96 Originals, Celebrate a quarter-century of culinary excellence at Logan Brown\u2019s 29th anniversary lunch, where the past meets the present in a delicious fusion of food and stories. Join Steve Logan and Shaun Clouston, alongside original Logan Brown team members Francois Febvre (La Cloche) and Shepherd Elliott (previously of Ti Kouka, Leeds Street Bakery, Shepherd, Concord and The Test Kitchen), for a special afternoon filled with fantastic kai and plenty of memories.\r\n\r\nAs the doors of Logan Brown first opened in 1996, it quickly became one of Wellington\u2019s most beloved dining destinations. Now, this unforgettable event offers a chance to reminisce with the chefs who helped shape the restaurant\u2019s legacy, sharing tales from the early days while serving up a feast of flavours inspired by their storied careers.\r\n\r\nFor any longtime Logan Brown fan or someone curious to the whakapapa of Wellington food, this is a celebration of the friendships, milestones, and moments that have defined one of New Zealand\u2019s most iconic dining experiences. Expect a menu that reflects Logan Brown\u2019s rich history, prepared with passion and paired with great conversation, laughter, and a few tall tales.",

    "description": "Harmonic Sound Journey at Space with Claudio, Harmonic Sound Journey at Space with Claudio\nWe invite you to a special evening of Sacred Harmonic Sound with multi-instrumentalist Claudio Escutia. This immersive sound journey offers a deeply restorative experience that invites you to settle into stillness, reconnect with the heart, and explore a sense of inner spaciousness through vibration and tone.\nClaudio skilfully layers the sounds of gongs, crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, Native American flutes, and other traditional instruments, enhanced through high-quality audio equipment so the sound can be both heard and felt throughout your body.\nHarmonic sound and vibration offer the nervous system a chance to truly rest. In this state of relaxation, the thinking mind softens, and we find connection to citta \u2014 the heart-mind. From this place, silence arises naturally through the vehicle of sound.\nThis experience is open to everyone. No previous yoga or meditation practice is needed.\n\nWhat to bring:\nYou are welcome to bring your own yoga mat, though studio mats are also available. We will provide bolsters, blankets, and eye pillows for your comfort.\n\nBooking is essential \u2014 spaces are limited and this event often fills quickly.\n\nAbout Claudio\nClaudio is a multi-instrumentalist musician originally from Mexico City and now based in Wellington. Born into a family of musicians, he began playing music at a young age and later studied classical guitar. His journey led him to Montreal, where he explored jazz, world music, and spiritual sound traditions.\n\nExtensive travels in Asia and Europe deepened his connection with Indian music and yogic philosophy. He studied Tibetan singing bowls in Kathmandu and Varanasi, and has since worked with a wide range of instruments including the sitar, esraj, bansuri, harmonium, flutes, gongs, and voice.\n\nClaudio\u2019s work blends technical skill, deep presence, and a profound respect for the healing power of sound.\n\nLearn more or listen to Claudio\u2019s music here:\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/claudioescutiasounds\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/claudio_yoga_sound_healing\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/soundhealingyogamusicclaudio\n\n\n",

And don\u2019t forget \u2013 there are spot prizes for the fiercest looks, so bring your best Leather or Lace fantasy.\n\nWho\u2019s it for?\nCoven is a celebration crafted exclusively for queer women and gender minorities. Whether you\u2019re sapphic, trans, nonbinary, genderqueer \u2013 this is your night to shine.\n\nEvening Highlights:\n- 7pm Cocktail Hour: Fabulous arrival photos, sip on our sexy drink specials and soak in the vibes with live sapphic music.\n- An evening of entertainment from burlesque, to the kinkier kind, and flash tattoos by an incredible local artist\n- Our infamous dessert grazing table\n\nTickets are strictly limited \u2013 and they WILL sell out.

Coven is about belonging \u2013 and there\u2019s a place here for you.\n\nCoven Kaupapa\nFor queer women and gender minorities, spaces like this are rare, vital, and sometimes, life-changing. In a world that constantly centers cishet norms, Coven offers a space where we are the default \u2013 where you can fully show up as yourself, be seen, celebrated and surrounded by YOUR community.\n\nFor many in our Coven, this is one of the only opportunities we feel comfortable enough to experience nightlife free from the male gaze, tokenism, fear, or the need to shrink ourselves to fit in. It\u2019s a space where sapphic, trans, nonbinary, and gender-diverse people aren\u2019t just welcomed \u2013 we are centered. It\u2019s for those who are often pushed to the margins, who rarely feel represented in \u201cinclusive\u201d spaces that still cater to the mainstream.\n\nThis night exists because we need it \u2013 and because we create it, together.\n\nAccessibility\nThe event is held upstairs at Whisky & Wood, a stunning venue with gender-neutral bathrooms and lift access (note there is a small bump as you enter). Staff will be ready to help if needed. Have specific accessibility needs? Reach out directly at hello@whiskyandwood.co.nz.\n\nCommunity Tickets\nWe want Coven to be for everyone. At checkout, consider donating toward our community ticket fund. Can\u2019t afford a ticket? Email willysmackntush@gmail.com with the subject \u201cFree for Me\u201d and your preferred name. We\u2019ll be gifting free tickets on Friday 18 October.\n\nIf you made it this far...

After a devastating earthquake in 1931 levelled much of the city, Napier was rebuilt in the architectural style of the time\u2014Art Deco.\nInfluenced by the glamour and optimism of the early 20th century, the new buildings featured bold geometric patterns, sunbursts, zigzags, and elegant fa\u00e7ades that have since become iconic. \u2018The Art Deco Experience\u2019 includes a visit to the Art Deco Centre and a guided 1hr bus tour of Napier with a tour guide from the Art Deco Trust.\nSip, Savour, and Soak in the Views\nTravel by coach from Hastings through to the Northern reaches of Napier, towards Bay View, and disembark at the Crab Farm Winery to indulge in a special wine tasting and late lunch opportunity from a beautifully crafted set menu.\nCrab Farm Winery was established in the early 1980\u2019s with the first vintage under the Crab Farm Winery label released in 1987. The land at Crab Farm has been in the Jardine family for over 100 years. Originally purchased without viewing beforehand \u2013 Hamish Jardine\u2019s great grandfather was alarmed to find his new land was actually partially underwater. With tidal pools, rushes and hundreds of Crabs, the family jokingly named it \u2018Crab Farm\u2019.\nNapier at your Leisure\nEnjoy a few hours of free time in Napier\u2019s vibrant CBD\u2014perfect for discovering the city at your own pace. Wander among world-famous Art Deco buildings, stroll the scenic Marine Parade, or relax at a local caf\u00e9 with a Hawke\u2019s Bay treat.

We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Driftwood from nearby south coast beaches is often abundant, feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page.

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

Extra materials such as chains and findings are available to purchase.\nFor health and safety reasons class participants must wear sturdy, closed toe shoes and have their hair tied back.\nWorkshop fee $128, Early bird $115 till 17 August.

    "description": "Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour, Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour\nIndie-Folk Artist Colette Rivers and her band will be performing her intimate new album, The Backyard Wonder.\n\nIndependent artist Colette Rivers is releasing her second full-length album, The Backyard Wonder, an intimate exploration of healing, change, and the quiet beauty of ordinary moments.\n\nThis album holds special meaning for Rivers: after being diagnosed with cancer in July 2023, her planned sophomore release had to take a back seat to recovery. But when the cancer returned in early 2025, she felt compelled to finish and release the album, not just as a legacy project, also as a celebration after hard times, with a focus on how \u201cyou can find the wonder in life, even in your backyard.\u201d\n\nA lifelong creative, Rivers records, mixes, and produces in her home studio in Masterton, and plays every instrument heard on The Backyard Wonder. Her debut album, Memory Lake (2020), was shaped by early years spent in the US, and her move to Taup\u014d at age 11; this was followed by a nationwide tour. Now based in the Wairarapa and working as a secondary school drama teacher, Rivers continues to move between solo performance and full band sets, while staying rooted in the acoustic traditions that define her sound.\n\nWith her right arm partially paralysed following recent treatment, Rivers has gathered a group of close friends to help bring the songs of The Backyard Wonder to life (especially its intricate fingerpicking parts) for a run of live shows. She\u2019ll be touring the Wellington and Wairarapa regions from August through October, finishing with a set at the Wellington Folk Festival.\n\nFor updates, and behind-the-scenes glimpses, visit www.coletteriversmusic.com or follow @colettemusic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nOpening for Rivers are artists:\n\nPhil Masters\nPhil Lively-Masters is an experienced, well travelled singer songwriter who specialises in writing the sort of Sun Kissed West Coast Laurel Canyon Americana that made Neil Young, Stephen Stills and the Byrds famous. With a powerful, honey soaked voice that has won praise and support slots from legendary American country rock pioneers like The Jayhawks and original cosmic cowboy Steve Young, Phil has 20 years worth of road worn original songs to pull on, including tracks from the critically acclaimed CANYON RYDE album 'Free To Be' and some choice country rock covers to weave a spell on any listener.\n\nSaali Marks\nA singer, songwriter, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, Saali Marks hails originally from the\nSouth Island, but has made Wairarapa his home for the last 20 years, where he lives on a farm\nwith his family and teaches music at Kuranui College.\nSaali has played in numerous bands over the years, in a wide range of styles from proto-punk\nto psychedelic dub, covers, originals and fully improvised music with no discernible genre, on\nstages throughout Aotearoa since 1991. Currently he fronts the Wellington ska band Battleska\nGalactica.\nThroughout and alongside it all Saali has indulged his love for songwriting and solo\nperforming, developing a unique style, rooted in folk and blues, and inspired by greats from\nacross the decades. A skilled guitarist, Saali rarely plays straight ahead chords, and an\neducation in jazz has informed his ear for harmony, the beauty of dissonance, tension and\nresolution, with unconventional song structures, alternate tunings and intriguing melodies.\nAlthough not adverse to penning the odd love song, most of Saali\u2019s lyrics tend to focus on\nother aspects of the human condition, from religion and politics to our relationships with the\nenvironment and our own minds.\n\n",

The album drops 19 September on streaming & vinyl.\n\nNever overblown or overproduced, Dreams That Feel Like Falling is direct and intimate. 11 tracks of warmth, sincerity and brashness that strike a balance of breeze and overdrive.\n\nTo celebrate the release, Cowboy Dan are heading out for a run of shows throughout Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui in September and October.\n\nThis Te Whanganui-a-Tara will be the second outing in the capital for Cowboy Dan, who are delighted to bring Echo Children along for the ride from T\u0101maki to share their special tunes and infectous harmoines, along with Te Whanganui-a-Tara local legends Search For Yeti...STACKED!\n\nOnce aptly described as The Bats on the right amount of Red Bull, Cowboy Dan has been treating audiences across the motu to energetic, emotionally charged tunes since 2015. Their live shows have consistently delivered good times to fans and new friends alike.\n\nOff the back of two delightful EPs: We Will Hesitate, When We Eventually Wait (2017, Mixed by Jonathan Pearce); Sentimental Now That We're Leaving (2021, Mixed by Rohan Evans), the debut LP, Dreams That Feel Like Falling, is a continuation and a few steps forward, showcasing the bands expansive sonic pallet, with a mix of distortion, introspection, heart and bite.\n\nSearch For Yeti draws from a deep range of influences to create a sound that achieves the difficult feat of being hugely atmospheric and diverse while also being hook laden. This is an act that captures people with their onstage energy \u2014 and gets them talking afterwards about the songs that they just heard.\n\nFollowing in the long tradition of innovative Aotearoa indie bands, Echo Children craft a distinctive sound by melding psychedelic pop harmonies with sharp alt-country songwriting.\n\nGather your pals and get ready for good times! A thursday, sure, but what a chance to digest some upbeat goodness hailing from the big smoke and with some local goodness to boot.\n\n",

    "description": "Folk B*tch Trio - Wellington, Folk Bitch Trio - 'Now Would Be A Good Time' Album Tour with special guest Georgia Knight\n\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories. Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology",

    "description": "Folk B*tch Trio - Wellington, Folk Bitch Trio - 'Now Would Be A Good Time' Album Tour with special guest Georgia Knight\n\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories. Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology",

John Campbell highlights some consistent themes of Brian Tamaki's Destiny Church: far-right prejudices, manifest anger, and hatred.\nIn Auckland on 21 June, Destiny Church organised a march to take \"a bold public stand for Christian values, Kiwi identity and the future of this nation\".\nOn Saturday, 13 September, Brian Tamaki attended the London \u201cUnite the Kingdom\u201d protest organised by far-right political activist Tommy Robinson that claimed to celebrate 'free speech', but also contained chants of hate, racist conspiracy theories, and Christian nationalist slogans. Among disturbing scenes, some people in the crowd ripped up a flag that read 'Secular Humanism'. To them, the very idea that people of all backgrounds and beliefs can live together with equality and respect is something to fear and destroy. For decades, the far right in the USA has painted humanism as a bogeyman, blaming it for liberal values, the rights of women, and the rights of LGBT people. It shows that those who thrive on fear are deliberately targeting the very values that underpin human rights and human dignity. Humanism is not a fringe or \u2018woke\u2019 idea. It is about fairness. It is about reason. It is about believing in the good that people are capable of when they are free to live their lives without fear or prejudice. These protests, which Brian Tamaki is supporting, are a show of force from those who wish to undo progress, to divide communities, and to undermine cherished freedoms.\nWe have a growing concern for secular values in our community. We cannot be silent. It is essential to keep compassion alive in public life and politics. After watching the documentary, we will discuss our concerns and how we might respond.\nTime: Oct 6, 2025 06:30 PM Auckland, Wellington\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/88183700512...\n",

Sticking to the traditional one man band format, Chuck plays all the instruments simultaneously.\nCaptivating storytelling intertwines effortlessly with heart stopping harmonica. Multiple guitar styles are underpinned by his left and right feet frantically pounding the kick and hi hat. The listener is left simply wondering, \"How the hell does he do that\"?\nOriginally hailing from the UK, Li\u2019l Chuck has been stomping his music in NZ since 2003.\nLi'l Chuck has performed at many high profile events around New Zealand including opening for American legend Jimmy Buffet, Bluesman Jerron 'Blind Boy' Paxton and The Topp Twins, and festivals including Blues on Broadbeach, Gold Coast Australia, Dunedin and Wanaka Arts festivals, The Great Kiwi Beer festival, Canterbury folk festival and many more.\nUp to 2025, He has recorded 5 solo one man band records to great acclaim by international Blues publications.\nHis 2017 album Utility Blues hit No\u20196 on the official NZ albums chart & has twice been the feature artist on Jesse Mulligan's Radio New Zealand\u2019s Friday live.\nIn an age where we are rushing around at breakneck speed, where everything is instant, sugar coated, airbrushed and overly polished, Li\u2019l Chuck brings us down to earth with some organic, all natural, whole grain, naked goodness.\nDoors open 7pm for a 7.30pm start.",

    "description": "Make Some Noise - choral music that matters, After a successful performance of Mozart\u2019s classic Requiem in D Minor in May, Supertonic is back with a programme of contemporary choral music that matters. \nOn the evening of Saturday 8 November, Supertonic will present Make Some Noise at the Lower Hutt Town Hall. This is the first time the choir has performed in the Hutt Valley, and they hope to see some new faces in the audience as they bring this programme of  meaningful music from around the world to the stage.  \nMake Some Noise highlights issues of social justice, including indigenous, women\u2019s and civil rights and climate action. The programme is rich and varied, from Katerina Gimon\u2019s arrangement of AURORA\u2019s Apple Tree, a Norwegian pop song addressing the urgency of the global climate crisis, to Robert T. Gibson\u2019s arrangement of the gospel standard This Little Light of Mine. Oliassa by Malika Tirolien utilises an invented language to invoke a call from the ancestors, while Alex Vollant titles their piece Auass meaning \u201cchild\u201d in the Innu language to honour the generation of elders who survived the Residential Schools in Canada. The impact of sexual harassment and assault on women is highlighted in MILCK\u2019s I Can\u2019t Keep Quiet  and Lillia Ruocco and Emmanuelle Ader\u2019s Canzone r\u00f2 curtiell\u2019. Closer to home, Make Some Noise features a set of waiata in teo reo M\u0101ori to highlight the importance of indigenous voices in Aotearoa New Zealand, including Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s Whakarongo. This waiata-\u0101-ringa incorporates Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s beliefs and methodology on teaching te reo M\u0101ori.   \nLed by co-Musical Director Virginie Pacheco, Supertonic offers Make Some Noise as an invitation to concert-goers to consider the causes that are important to them. In connecting with audiences through the striking and impactful works of the composers featured in this programme - by turns harmonious, raucous, gut-wrenching, resolute - the choir hopes to inspire those listening to make some noise in their own lives. \nSupertonic was formed in 2014 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and strives to  push the boundaries of what choral music can be. The choir has performed concerts that cover the entire musical spectrum, from major classical works including Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Vivaldi's Gloria and Faure's Requiem to pop and rock spectaculars celebrating hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s from the likes of Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Elton John, Queen, and Celine Dion. The choir has performed alongside The Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, joined Brett McKenzie, the NZSO and The Muppets for the Jim Henson Retrospectacle,  shared the stage with Mama Kin Spender at Coastella, and performed in national civic commemorations, street festivals and at community events.",

    "description": "Sapphic Somatics: A Queer Embodiment Workshop, Somatic: Of or relating to the body, particularly the perception of physical sensations and internal experiences\n\nWhat does it feel like to exist in a queer body? This workshop aims to help sapphic women and gender minorities find joy, freedom, and connection through somatic exercises that help you embody and embrace your queerness. You will leave feeling confident in your ability to take up space, tapped into your self-expression, and connected to the experiences of your sapphic community.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of what to expect:\n- Opening Exercise: Guided somatic movements to loosen up your body\n- Community Connection: Rotating conversations with other participants about queer embodiment\n- Yoga Flow: Creative 30 minute class to explore presence and connect to your self-expression\n- Guided Meditation: A relaxing combination of breathwork and visualisation to cultivate safety in your body\n- Closing Connection: Gentle and grounding partner stretches (optional) and group reflections\n\nNo prior experience with yoga or somatic exercises necessary! All you need to attend is an open attitude, a desire to connect with your body, and a willingness to share your experience with other sapphics. Yoga mats and all other props will be provided. While this workshop dives into your embodied expression of sapphic identity/sexuality, none of the content is sexual in nature and the small amount of physical touch with other participants is completely optional.\n\nThe workshop is facilitated by Megan Edwards, creator of Golden Hour Gigs and a 500CYT trauma-informed yoga teacher. This event is intended specifically for queer women and gender minorities. No TERFS no SWERFS.\n\nContent consideration: Because this workshop focuses on finding joy/pleasure/freedom in your body, it might not be suited for anyone experiencing intense dysphoria. With that said, you are welcome to explore discomfort and work on integrating challenging feelings. Megan is trained in movement techniques to lead you away from anything too activating and help you find safety in your body.\n\nAccessibility: Awhi Yoga Studios has an elevator and is wheelchair accessible. There are plenty of gender neutral bathrooms and cosy spaces to rest if you need a break from the workshop at any time. If you want to attend but are concerned about the level of movement required, please email the organiser with any mobility questions at goldenhourgigz@gmail.com",

This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\n",

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nMercy Lie:\n\nDriving all night under the stars, along the highways of human experience, the original songs of Mercy Lie will haunt, surprise, remind and affirm.\n\nMercy Lie is the musical guise of Laura Chester-Murphy. An instinctive sound maker from an early age, Laura just wants to keep the music rolling. There\u2019s a lot of sound from that little acoustic guitar and a voice to match. In the songs, you will find fierce independence, crushing vulnerability and a reflective wit that speaks to a life of figuring stuff out along the way.\n\nWith influences ranging across and not limited to folk, funk, country, goth, indie and 90\u2019s rave, Laura puts the focus on crafting percussive earworms that won\u2019t leave your head easily. The music of Mercy Lie is a unique soundscape, sculpted with ambience and depth, the silence unforgettably painted by explorations into the motivations of both the self and fellow travellers.\n\nMercy Lie is about connecting over the foibles of polite society and the ways we are wired to weave around each other.\n\nHometowns, journeys, mysteries, ghosts, growing up, messing up, speaking out, moving on. If you like getting nostalgic over something and nothing all at once, buckle up.\n\n\u201cMercy Lie\u2019s novel approach to the guitar and talent for songwriting make for the perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that voice to come from that mouth.\u201d\n\u201cAn acoustic delight!\u201d\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience. As she continues to evolve as an artist, Araiyah\u2019s music promises to touch the hearts of many, leaving a lasting impact on all who have the privilege of listening.\n\nAraiyah will be accompanied by guitarist Izzy and Laura Chester-Murphy on percussion.\n\nRain and the Urban Bohemians:\n\nFormed around the music of singer-songwriter Cathy Elizabeth aka Rain, supported by her band of Urban Bohemians, this group has been able to weave together many different influences and styles to create something quite unique and beautiful.\n\nPeppered with contemplations of our existence and the fleetingness of time, Rain & the UBs bring the magic with a folk-rock edge and an alluring authenticity at its centre. Spiritual undertones and overtones give way to an uplifting joyfulness, of triumph over difficulties and life lessons learned and expressed through music.\n\nWith Cathy Elizabeth on vocals & acoustic guitar, Chris Ewers on bass, Murray James on drums and Izzy and Dion on guitars, these guys have got the goods and are ready to deliver!\n\nSo come along and allow yourself to be immersed and transported, moved and entertained.

With a deep adoration for Pacific musical reference points and a desire to explore new sonic ground, LEAO synthesises non-traditional tonalities with a fa\u2018asamoa spirit, creating what some have called \u201cniu wave\u201d and \u201cPacific neo-psychedelia.\u201d A creative enigma and phenomenal live act since the release of their critically acclaimed debut GHOST ROADS in 2019, LEAO has continued to expand its vision with the 2024 single TAEAO / MEA UMA - a sparkling glimpse into a significant body of alternative Pacific music currently in development. The group is now actively working towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\n\nRomi Wrights\n\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring stories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke festival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release mid to late 2025.",

Located on the eastern side of Antananarivo, the capital, the orphanage was founded by the incredible Madame Hary in 2012. What started as a humble project from her own home has grown into a haven for 54 children, some of whom were rescued from areas where twins are sadly believed to be cursed.\n\nDespite the challenges, the orphanage continues to thrive, relying entirely on the kindness of visitors. They grow their own rice, maintain a small chicken farm, and have a vegetable garden to sustain themselves. But their greatest need is for ongoing support and resources to continue providing for these beautiful children.\n\nBy attending our concert, you\u2019ll be helping make a direct impact on the lives of these children. All profits from this concert will go toward completing the construction of a much-needed training center and extra bedrooms at Mamitiana Orphanage in Madagascar, helping provide valuable education and support to the children in their care. In May this year, we raised over $4000 at a fundraising concert and $1700 on Givealittle. Help us raise $2500 more so they can finish the building before the arrival of the rainy season.",

Now sixteen years into an extraordinary career, it seems our heroine has fully accepted her mantle as one of the world\u2019s great rock stars, fronting her gothic-tinged new outfit to widespread awe and acclaim, Devra Hoff on bass guitar and backing vocals, Teeny Lieberson on keys, guitar, and backing vocals, and Jorge Balbi on drums.\n\n\u201cThe Attachment Theory are a tight unit, woven together by Devra Hoff\u2019s inventive, intelligent bass lines... this show was less about [Sharon\u2019s] past and more about her future, which appears to lie with The Attachment Theory - a band who, on this evidence, are bringing the very best out of her.\u201d \u2013 Manchester Evening News\n\nAlso performing at The Others Way, and playing support in Wellington and Christchurch, American songwriter Shannon Lay is much of a punk as she is a folk singer, citing both The Ramones and Nick Drake as influences. As a member of garage rocker Ty Segall\u2019s Freedom Band, Lay can certainly make a racket, but for these shows, she will be opening as a solo act. The Guardian were quick to assure us that \u201cThis is no mere indie-folk musician,\u201d and Pitchfork said her most recent studio album \u201cpresents a quiet, lovely, undramatic rendering of the dramatic\u201d.\n\nWe truly could not be more excited to be welcoming Queen Shazza back to Aotearoa for these shows, and with the addition of both her band The Attachment Theory and Shannon Lay\u2019s opening spot, you should be dang well excited too!\n\n\u201cSharon Van Etten and The Attachment Theory\u2019s self-titled record is an early Album of the Year contender\u201d - www.independent.co.uk",

At the same time you ask? Come find out.\n\nEdera is an alt-rock\u2013indie\u2013sad girl artist from Te Whanganui-a-Tara, delivering romantic yet callous songwriting that makes you want to dance, cry, and maybe do both at once. Ederacore blends lush indie textures with gritty rock energy, brought to life by melancholy rock legends Aidan Thomas-Inwood (guitar), Lily Hodgson-Bell (bass), and Taiki Yoshino (drums) - Together, they create an immersive live experience\u2014intimate, cathartic, and impossible to forget.\n\nLadyReign is a six-piece alternative-metal band blending soul-stirring harmonies with the raw\nintensity of heavy metal breakdowns. Fronted by two powerful female vocalists, the band\ncreates a captivating contrast that draws inspiration from both soulful icons like Lianne La\nHavas and the crushing heaviness of bands like Spiritbox. LadyReign fuses vulnerability with\naggression in a sound that is both haunting and refreshing.\nWith their fearless blend of metal and soul, LadyReign is a band that leaves an unforgettable\nmark on the Wellington and wider Aotearoa music scene.\n\nIn faith to the literal etymology of the term 'metalcore', Cryfor combines Bridge 9, Deathwish era hardcore with golden era melodic death metal. As hard as they are brutal, Cryfor aims to bring real deal spin kickers and battle jacket bros together in the same pit.\nOriginally starting as the bedroom recording project of vocalist and lyricist Ella O'Neill, Cryfor is a band dedicated to reviving and breathing new life into 2000s style metalcore.\nAfter recruiting drummer Fionn Lawley, and guitarist/backing vocalist Daniel Jenner (ex King Hit HC & Temperatures Rising) in late 2024 and bassist Daniel Walters in early 2025, Cryfor has been a rolling tank of non-stop hatemosh force.\nAfter months in the lab at MOSH SCIENCE HQ, Cryfor release 'The Winter Demo', and has since punished Valhalla, San Fran, Thistle Hall and Underworld Tavern with fuck you mosh parts of toughness, vocals or sheer brutality and ancient melodies foretold by prophets of evil... and that's only the start.\n\n",

    "description": "Slow Grind Fever [AUS] - Wellington Jazz Festival, Express from Melbourne, Australia and crossing international waters for the first time this October, Meow is excited to welcome the slowest, spookiest, smokiest and swingin-est club night Wellington has ever seen: 'Slow Grind Fever'.\nFor this one-night-only episode of SGF Wellington, founder Richie1250 (106.7 PBS FM) will be joined by fellow Melbourne radio alumnus Dr. Popalotacorn (RRR, 98.1FM Raglan) and Wellington's own belle of the airwaves Miss Juliet (RadioActive.FM Americana)\nSlow Grind Fever was born in 2012 when Richie1250 hired a Russian Cultural Centre ballroom and threw a slow dance party for his 30th birthday, and it's been running as a regular monthly club night ever since. Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

    "description": "You Spot It You Got It: Unpacking cultural conditioning and turning the mirror inwards, Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Pacific style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and effective insights. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from different communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from You Spot It, You Got It?\nIn You Spot It, You Got It, you will deepen self-awareness by being encouraged to recognise some of your own conditioning and impacts of this in your daily life/practices. When we are not conscious of the things that might not sit right within us then we unknowingly or knowingly project them onto others. What we reject, we project. By examining patterns and recognising our conditioning, then we can truly understand how we can live in more conscious ways. This Talanoa Tai learning experience offers space for talanoa, tools and exercises to facilitate introspection and personal growth by turning the mirror inwards.\nThis is a 3.5 hour in-person learning experience. The day will start with a mihi whakatau to welcome you into the space.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\nFacilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives. Fa\u2019aeafale\u2019upolu (Polu) Samuelu is the facilitator of this Talanoa Tai Learning experience.",

    "description": "The Beatniks x IVY - NZ Tour 2025 - Wellington, \u2018IVY\u2019 and \u2018The Beatniks\u2019, two of the biggest independent artists coming out of \u014ctepoti, are both known for their highly-captivating live performances. Melancholic in one instance, and packed full of noisy energy the next - now geared up with new material to showcase, the art-rock and surf-punk stylings of each of these young acts are tighter than ever.\n\u2018IVY\u2019 are held in the highest of regards when it comes to emerging kiwi artists. Nestling within the realm of dark and brooding tones, and immense, layered chorus, IVY know how to deliver a powerful and emotionally-resonant set; their sharp growth has quickly turned heads nationwide. From appearing on festival lineups such as Snow machine and OUSA Ori, playing with the Dunedin Youth Orchestra, and earning the SRN 2024 People\u2019s Choice Award, IVY are ready to take their breathtaking art-rock performance around Aotearoa for the first time.\n\u2018The Beatniks\u2019 have been playing together since 2021, and have quickly become a \u2018must-see\u2019 live act within Aotearoa. After playing large-scale festivals last year, such as Rhythm & Alps, their recent release has delivered a more mature sound. Yet still soaked in their signature surf-grunge style. Having not toured the North Island since their debut album \u2018Archetype\u2019 in 2023, they\u2019re ready to show you a whole new layer of alt-rock spirit on the stage.\n\nSET TIMES:\n7pm - Doors Open\n7:30pm - Half/Angel\n8:30pm - IVY\n9:50pm - The Beatniks ",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\n\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.\n\n",

Hosted on the manicured grounds of a local golf course, this gentle evening stroll allows you to experience the magic of darkness without worrying about uneven paddocks or rough terrain.\n\nAs we walk together, the transition from dusk to dark will naturally unfold, helping us acclimatise to the night. For those new to walking in the dark, handy red-light torches will be provided to keep you comfortable. This is less about distance and more about slowing down, stepping slightly outside of your comfort zone, and embracing the calm of night.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll reflect on the value of darkness - its role in history, its impact on wellbeing, and its importance for the environment. We\u2019ll then pause to share hot chocolate and, if the skies are clear, look up in awe at a canopy of stars. With star charts in hand, we\u2019ll explore what the November night skies have to offer and why protecting them matters.\n\nThe evening concludes with simple, practical ways we can all help preserve our night skies - because our environment doesn\u2019t end at the treetops, it stretches all the way to the stars.\n\nPhoto credits: Jet Productions",

    "description": "the Jesus Lizard, After initially calling it a day in 1999, the Jesus Lizard officially return full time to save us from the current state of musical mediocrity with their latest album, Rack. A blistering resurgence of the so-called \u2018noise rock\u2019 they helped define alongside contemporaries Big Black, Flipper, The Birthday Party, with their previous and most noted albums Head, Goat and Liar. For those of us who live in fear of the reunion album and subsequent tour, the Jesus Lizard thankfully display not only the same chaotic and dark nihilism of their earlier careers but also the maturity and seasoning of a band riding a wave of renewed and reinvigorated form.\n\nOnce slated by famed engineer Steve Albini as \u201cthe greatest band I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019 the Jesus Lizard not only lived up to this lofty praise in their prime but continue to do so in their advancing years. David Yow still leads the charge as the maniacally possessed frontman entering crowds with reckless abandon and a stamina that much younger vocalists would kill for. The original rhythm section of David Wm Sims and Mac McNeilly further continue to prove why they were and are the best bass & drum combo since Jones and Bonham, anchoring the ship as Captain Yow and first mate Denison navigate the wild seas of their songs. And while he may not always feature (as he rightly should) on many modern music journalists \u2018best guitarists lists\u2019, Duane Denison could perhaps be the most innovative and idiosyncratic punk rock guitarist EVER. However, each member is a sum of their parts but combined they are as Albini also once said \u201cthe purest melding of the sublime and profane.\u201d\n\nWhether you are a longtime disciple of the Jesus Lizard, seeing them when last here in \u201898, or perhaps your fandom is more recent and have only seen videos of their legendary live performances, you will know that these shows are not to be missed.\n\nSaturday 11th October 2025 - The Tuning Fork, Auckland (All ages)\n\nSunday 12th October 2025 - San Fran, Wellington (R18 unless accompanied by your legal guardian)",

    "description": "Wendyhouse / DSLB / vegetable.machine.animal, Wendyhouse / DSLB / vegetable.machine.animal\nWendyhouse are Bryce Galloway and Daniel Powell (AKA Mr Pudding and EE monk). The pair met at the Elam School of Fine Arts. Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995. Wendyhouse output has been somewhat sporadic ever since, but with EE monk\u2019s recent return, the pair have returned to performing live.\n\nWendyhouse music was initially played on toy musical instruments, the kind that fit inside a Wendy house. Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\n\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo. Guitar, toy keyboard and vocals are the Wendyhouse instruments of choice.\n\n---\n\n\nDSLB\n\nDSLB is the solo project of Chrissie Butler (the shouty bass playing half of the now sleeping duo, mr sterile Assembly). An offshoot from Chrissie's other band Ditzy Squall, DSLB (Ditzy Squall's Lunch Box) is a showcase for a love of long endings and the hum things make when you hold them close to your ear. Performed live, DSLB is an improvised mash-up of ancient record players, purring keyboards, kitchen utensils and found objects. Soundtracks for short films and hand drawn comics are also residents in the lunch box. Recordings are released by skirted Records.\n\nhttps://skirtedrecords.com/dslb/\n\n---\n\nvegetable.machine.animal\n\nNew solo project courtesy of Mr Sterile, in which living fungal and plantlife inform a modular synthesiser with biofeedback.

    "description": "Bach Choir, Nota Bene, Chiesa Ensemble - Bach's Christmas Oratorio, The Bach Choir of Wellington, in collaboration with Nota Bene and the Chiesa Ensemble, presents Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio (Parts I, II, III & VI).\n\nBach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio, BWV 248, is a spiritually rich masterpiece composed during 1723 and 1724 and first performed in its entirety during the Christmas season of 1734\u20131735 while Bach was serving in Leipzig. Drawing on earlier secular cantatas and a now-lost church cantata (BWV 248a), this oratorio weaves together a vibrant tapestry of sacred music celebrating the birth of Christ.\n\nThis performance features four of the six cantatas:\n\nPart I opens with a dazzling transformation of secular music into sacred celebration. Drums, strings, winds, and triumphant trumpets set the stage for the Evangelist\u2019s narration and a sequence of expressive recitatives and arias, including the beloved \u201cBereite dich, Zion\u201d and the majestic \u201cGro\u00dfer Herr, o starker K\u00f6nig.\u201d Chorales, including the Passion Chorale, frame the cantata with solemn beauty.\n\nPart II begins with a pastoral, tender tone, portraying the shepherds\u2019 encounter with the angel. The sinfonia evokes a rustic charm with oboes and flutes, leading into serene chorales and the exquisite slumber aria, where the flute hovers like a halo above the alto voice. The cantata concludes with a joyful \u201cGlory to God\u201d and a reprise of \u201cVom Himmel hoch.\u201d\n\nPart III returns to grandeur with trumpets and drums, as the shepherds journey to Bethlehem. The Evangelist\u2019s narration is interwoven with contemplative chorales, a duet for soprano and bass, and an aria reflecting Mary\u2019s inner thoughts. The cantata closes with a reprise of its opening chorus, reinforcing its celebratory tone.\n\nPart VI, written for Epiphany, shifts to a darker mood as the story turns to Herod\u2019s treachery. The music is dramatic and unpredictable, mirroring the tension of the narrative. The arias and recitatives explore divine power and moral conflict, culminating in a triumphant final chorus embedded with the Passion Chorale\u2014symbolically linking Christ\u2019s birth to his eventual sacrifice.\n\nThis is the first time in over a decade the Christmas Oratorio is being performed in Wellington, making this a special opportunity to experience one of Bach\u2019s most joyful and profound creations. We hope you will join us for an evening of radiant music and festive spirit.",

    "description": "Pleiadian Encoded Attunement Circle | Wellington, Pleiadian Encoded Attunement Circle | Wellington\nA Boutique Galactic Group Experience to Uplift, Activate & Attune Your Energy\n\nAre you ready to connect with loving cosmic support, raise your vibration, and anchor powerful light codes that you can access again and again in your daily life?\n\nJoin me for a deeply transformative and high-frequency group healing and attunement experience \u2014 the Pleiadian Encoded Attunement Circle.\nThis sacred circle is designed to open your energy field to the uplifting and joyous frequency of the Pleiadians, guiding you into deeper alignment, soul activation, and vibrational expansion. Because I work and hold space within a high vibrational field, everyone present is able to access, attune to, and receive these elevated frequencies too - opening a gateway to higher states of awareness and multidimensional reconnection.\nThis is a multi-layered energetic journey that will support your soul\u2019s evolution and empower you with tools to continue accessing these frequencies whenever you need them.\n\nIn Ancient Atlantean Times...\nHealing was simple.\nPeople would sit before sacred, light-infused paintings, allowing frequency, sound, and intention to restore balance and harmony.\nI\u2019m bringing this ancient practice back.\n\nJoin me for a group Healing Session in Wellington \u2022 a beautiful multidimensional experience for deep new-code absorption, renewal, and alignment. You\u2019ll sit in sacred space before my Pleiadian Portal Painting, surrounded by gentle frequency music, sipping ceremonial Kakao, and immersed in high-vibrational energy.\nEach person will receive a clearing and then be guided through a powerful meditation and activation, with time to journal and share afterwards.\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s Included in This Sacred Attunement Journey\n\u2022 Individual Galactic Clearing\nWe begin by preparing your field for higher frequencies. Each participant will receive a personal energy clearing to release stagnant or lower vibrations, supported by channeled light language to open you to deeper transformation.\n\n\u2022 Heart-Opening Kacao Ceremony\nOnce the clearing is complete, we\u2019ll share a gentle ceremonial Kacao experience to expand the heart, deepen receptivity, and create a sacred container for Pleiadian frequencies to flow through.\n\n\u201cRaise Your Vibration\u201d Pleiadian Wisdom Talk\nI\u2019ll share insights into who the Pleiadians are, their role in humanity\u2019s awakening, and how their joyous, supportive energy can help you in everyday life. You\u2019ll also receive simple, powerful tools to help you reconnect with this frequency long after our circle.\n\n\u2022 Guided Meditation & Activation\nWe journey through a deeply guided meditation supported by my Pleiadian Encoded Artwork and light language transmissions.

Be prepared to drop into a deep space.\n\nDoor sales will be available if there is space. Advanced booking is recommended.\n\nSika's Sound Journeys are truly unique. They are sonic explorations that feature didgeridoos, drums, flutes, voice and orchestral elements. A collection of foraged sounds from objects he has recorded in nature, add even more textures. Many of his sounds are completely unrecognisable and abstract. Immersed in this cocoon of abstract sound, we can find ourselves in the most surprising places in our mind. In this timeless realm, beyond the normal limitations of rational reality, anything is possible.\n\nAn epic adventure deep inside yourself.\n\nJourney to worlds within worlds on incredible sound waves.\n\nSika creates a safe space to relax deeply and connect with our inner guidance. This Sound Journey begins and ends with a short guided visualisation.\n\nThere will be two journeys with an interval. Most people choose to lie down, so once again, please bring a yoga mat, pillow and blanket to get really comfortable.\n\nA journal is also recommended.",

Be prepared to drop into a deep space.\nDoor sales will be available if there is space. Advanced booking is recommended.\nSika's Sound Journeys are truly unique. They are sonic explorations that feature didgeridoos, drums, flutes, voice and orchestral elements. A collection of foraged sounds from objects he has recorded in nature, add even more textures.

In this timeless realm, beyond the normal limitations of rational reality, anything is possible.\nAn epic adventure deep inside yourself.\nJourney to worlds within worlds on incredible sound waves.\nSika creates a safe space to relax deeply and connect with our inner guidance. This Sound Journey begins and ends with a short guided visualisation.\nThere will be two journeys with an interval.

    "description": "NZIFF: Went Up the Hill, An unsettling, sinister slow-burn thriller, Samuel Van Grinsven unites rising star Dacre Montgomery with Phantom Thread\u2019s Vicky Krieps and New Zealand\u2019s own Sarah Peirse for a supernatural chiller like no other.\n\nIn the icy, shadow-stricken world of Went Up the Hill\u2019s Christchurch, it would seem that the death of Elizabeth, wife of Jill (Vicky Krieps), has taken with it warmth itself. The unexpected suicide of her partner has left her a hollowed-out shell \u2013 that is, until Jack (Dacre Montgomery), Elizabeth\u2019s long-absent son, arrives at the funeral, apparently invited by Jill herself, though she does not remember doing so.\n\nThe circumstances of Jack\u2019s long absence are unclear \u2013 all that is known is that Jack was given up for adoption at a very young age. Staying the night at Jill and Elizabeth\u2019s oppressive, concrete-clad mountain abode, it quickly becomes clear that the spirit of Elizabeth has not yet departed \u2013 instead, she has gained the ability to possess both wife and son and is utilising this ability to linger and address the needs of either relationship. What initially seems to be a gift from beyond, however, begins to sour when long-hidden secrets of the past begin to emerge, and lines between the two begin to be crossed.\n\nThe sophomore feature of Samuel Van Grinsven, Went Up the Hill is a wintry, gothic affair, and a showcase for the untapped talents of Montgomery, who most will recognise as the golden-haired, ill-fated muscle mutt Billy from Stranger Things. Essentially a two-hander (with occasional, welcome interjection from Kiwi legend Sarah Peirse as Jack\u2019s frosty, mystery-shrouded aunt), Van Grinsven tracks the trajectory of these two adrift people and the spirit between them \u2013 from unexpected refuge, to joy, to dread \u2013 with a purposeful, drip-fed escalation of tension. Questions of control, abuse and the lingering weight of past scars take hold, all while the usually pleasantly scenic Christchurch landscape is transformed into a suffocatingly claustrophobic ice prison. Van Grinsven\u2019s muscular direction bears none of the flashy excesses of an emerging filmmaker \u2013 his vision emerges, stately, imposing and fully-formed. \u2014 Tom Augustine",

    "description": "The Greatest Story - A Group of Wise Teachers Returning, Public Talk & Workshop\n\nThroughout history, especially at times of crisis, great spiritual teachers have emerged to show humanity the next step forward.\n\nAccording to British artist, author and esotericist Benjamin Creme, a group of such spiritual teachers is now living in the modern world. Maitreya, the World Teacher, and his group The Masters of Wisdom are here - not as religious teachers - to inspire all people to create a civilisation based on sharing, justice and peace; and for humanity to act to do the work to share and save our world.\n\nHumanity at spiritual crossroads\n\nHumanity is at crossroads. One path into the future leads to increasing social and economic division, environmental destruction, war and planetary peril. The other path leads to increasing social harmony, economic and environmental balance, and a golden era of peace.\n\n\nMaitreya\u2019s priorities\n\nTo help humanity in its task of global transformation, Maitreya has formulated certain priorities. They cover the essential needs of all people, every woman, man and child: an adequate supply of food\u037e housing for all; healthcare and education as basic universal rights. Other top priorities include the restoration of the environment and the establishment of peace.\n\nThe key to achieving these goals requires a major shift of present mind-set and thinking, structures and systems \u2013 and more equitable sharing of the world\u2019s food and resources. To realise humanity is one global family and the planet is a living being. According to Maitreya: \u201cWithout sharing, there can be no justice; without justice, there can be no peace; without peace, there can be no future.\u201d\n\n~ followed by short Transmission Meditation session ~\n\nShare International New Zealand.

The druids saw the earth as sacred \u2014 every tree, stone, and breath carrying rhythm and resonance.

The tent is lovely during the day, but as it gets dark, it takes on a magical feeling. Fairy lights and crystals lit by gently changing coloured lights. We have the fire going if it's cold, the sky curtain pulled if it's a clear night.\n\nThe evening starts with us welcoming in the Elements, the Directions and the web of life, into our sacred circle. Arniya then dances the energy in with Celestial Energy Movement, for the group. This creates a vortex of Divine power into the middle of the tent. Each person is linked into this Divine power, and receives a \"top-up\" of Divinity.\nWe then have an opportunity for each person to hold the Talking Stick and send positive energy to their life, or current experience, or to ask the Divine for help. This is completely optional. Throughout the evening, you will have opportunities to choose oracle cards to support your guidance through life.\n\nAt 8pm the Zoom people join our circle. They will get to choose an oracle card and be connected into the vortex of power in the tent. This always creates an energy of expansion within the group.\nArniya then gives a wee run down of any current energies influencing the planet, before she leads everyone on a Journey Meditation. Some weeks we to the V.U soul plane. Sometimes we travel to our inner world. Sometimes the guardians take us somewhere else entirely. Each journey is channelled to support the needs of whoever is present.\nAfter the meditation, we say goodbye to our Zoom friends, close the energy on the circle and give thanks. After this journey is complete, we have a cup of tea - time for a chat or playing with oracle cards, enjoying each other\u2019s company in the uplifted space.\n\n",

The moon reveals our emotional landscape, our inner rhythms, and often the fears that arise when we dare to live that full expression. Together, they form a powerful dialogue between structure and flow, logic and emotion, masculine and feminine.\n\nIn this workshop, Clare will guide you into an embodied exploration of your own sun and moon, inviting you to feel these two archetypes within your body and notice where they support, resist, or balance each other.\n\nBryony will lead you into vocal practices that bring these energies into sound and voice \u2014 giving expression to what is often left unspoken. Through voice, you\u2019ll release what holds you back and discover new harmony between your inner and outer selves.\n\nThis full moon is the perfect moment to unleash the voices of your sun and moon \u2014 and to step more fully into clarity, balance, and authentic expression.\n\nThe timing of this workshop gives you a unique opportunity to tune into these planets and benefit from their placement in the collective astrology.\n\nThe workshop will begin with the opportunity to explore powerful, enjoyable, accessible Voice Practices which open, align and strengthen your expression - and create physiological changes in your energy field.\n\nWe will then directly, bodily experience the energies of each of the Celestial Bodies through Embodied Astrology, guided by Clare.\n\nWe will integrate these energies, through further Voice Practices, including improvisation, healing chants and songs.\n\nThese two modalities will be carefully interwoven in an enjoyable, rich day's workshop that will benefit all participants.\n\nThere will be guided space in the workshop to integrate the energetic shifts and discoveries of both the Voice Practices and the Astrology.\n\nThis special workshop takes place on Saturday February 7th, 10am-4.30pm - we hope you can join us\n\nAt the Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Paraparaumu.\n\nINVESTMENT:\n\nYour investment for this day is $233. Shared lunch.\nSome concessions are available - please contact us by email .\n\nPayment by card here - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nPlease contact us with any questions at all.\n\n",

Register for this event to find out more about the Porirua Assembly on Climate and its innovations. \nPorirua is known for community-led innovations in governance and delivery, and the Porirua Assembly on Climate continued this tradition by being:\nthe first climate assembly in New Zealand,  \nthe first assembly co-designed and organised by an iwi authority and a community group, \nthe first assembly process designed to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi by using a tricameral design,  \nthe first New Zealand assembly to include children and young people, and \nby creating a new local governance body - the Porirua Community Leaders Forum - that sponsored the Assembly, holds its recommendations and can instigate ongoing community dialogue on local issues. \nPanellists will share learning on the Porirua Assembly\u2019s innovations, talk about why the standard citizens assembly model was modified, dig into what enabled so many firsts and how these worked out in practice. They will reflect on this legacy and possible future impacts. Might these democratic innovations strengthen local democracy elsewhere in Aotearoa New Zealand? \nAbout the Host and Speakers\nJodi Watene is a Systems Change Lead at Te R\u016bnanga o Toa Rangatira Incorporated, was the project manager for the Porirua Assembly and is helping to establish a New Zealand Community of Practice on Indigenous Citizens\u2019 Assemblies.\nMakerita Makapelu is a Team Leader for Wesley Community Action in Porirua with a background in performing arts and youth work.

    "description": "Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2, Blenheim Trail Runners Presents - Crush The Vernon - V2\nThe Second coming of the \"Crush the Vernon\" Vert Day is just around the corner, We had such a great time last time and its smack bang into the point where everyone needs elevation for events so i thought it would be silly not to bring it back!\n\n\"Crush the Vernon\" is a couple of fun endurance challeges to get us up into the Wither Hills for a big vert day!\nThis event will push you to the red line, boasting both as much high-level uphill suffering as you can possibly endure whilst building a steady accumulation of regret over 6 hours on the trails.\nIt\u2019s an event that's built to stretch the boundaries of what you think you can do uphill, but overall, it\u2019s a chance to get out there and have some fun, whether solo or in a team. Whilst there is some faster efforts needed to come out on top of any of these \u201cdisciplines\u201d, the aim of the game is just to get out there and enjoy yourself at whatever pace suits you.\n\nThe added extra this time is not only an extra hour, explained below, but the plan is to tie this into the elevation for a group effort for a BTR Everest Challenge, more details around this when I can get a team entry together, but really keen to try and pudh the limits of what has been done before.\n\nDetails:\nDate: 26th October - Backup date is the week after\nTime: 6am-1pm - (1 hr per week it too Hialry to conquer everest!)\nLocation: The Wither Hills, Basecamp: Sutherland Stream picnic area - this will be where we have the whiteboard & a bit of an \"Aid station/Bag drop\" situation going on.\n\nDisciplines:\n- \"Vernon Vert Masters\" Highest total elevation (solo/team) - pretty self explanatory, but between the hours of 6 am- 1pm any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day (solo or in a team) counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n\n- \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop (solo/team) - Crush the covenant Loop is a 3.75km, 300m vert loop running from Sutherland Stream Picnic Area to the Mt Vernon Summit & then back down again, the loops can be run in whichever direction you would like, just be aware that this is a 2-way track and there will be a bit more traffic than you would usually see up on it. The aim of the game here is to get as many laps in as possible between 6 am-1pm; this will also count toward your elevation total for the \"Vernon Vert Masters\"\n\nThe Basics:\n- This is an open event to anyone who wants to participate\n- The event is open from 6am-1pm - any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n- We will have a basecamp/aid station at the Sutherland stream picnic spot. This will be the hub for the meet-up and the start/finish line for the laps of \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d.\n- No minimum time, you can start whenever you like in the 6 am-1pm timeframe and go for as long as you would like.\n-You can do as many laps/summits/cumulative elevation as you like/can within the timeframe.\n- Teams - Teams can be between 2-5 people for the overall elevation challenge, and your total elevation will be your total accumulated. You will need to pre-register your team with Mikey before the day so that we can have you on the scoreboard.\n- You will need to confirm your solo/teams total elevation with Basecamp by 1.30pm on the day, in person. If you are unable to do this for whatever reason, you will need to confirm and prove details via message or screenshots so we can add them to the total tally.\n\n\nWho's up for some hills?\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nWe at Blenheim Trail Runners don\u2019t see ourselves as event organisers and as such, do not have any consent or insurance; we deem this as a \u201cClub Meet-up\u201d.\nWith that, the expectation is that you are 100% responsible for yourself and take part at your own risk.\nBe aware, as this isn't a formal event, there won't be any official timekeeping, marshals or trail markers. There will be DIY DIY-type whiteboard to note down your shared laps & elevation, and we will provide details via trail maps for the \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop.\nWe are unable to provide any/can not be held responsible for: Urgent medical attention (we will however, assist wherever possible, there will be a first aid kit at base camp), nutrition, hydration ( there is public access throughout the hills and in two points on the \u201ccrush the Covenant\u201d loop), the condition of the trail on the day or the weather.\n\n",

RAIN or SHINE, get ready to have fun!\n\nWe know K\u0101piti Run for Youth helps to support amazing community work done by local fundraising partners. We have 13 incredible fundraising partners you can choose to support and raise funds for. We are very proud of them all and the work they do to uplift the youth of K\u0101piti. Each partner brings something unique to the table, from providing essential resources and mentorship to creating spaces where young people can thrive. By supporting rangatahi through education, creativity, employment, and well-being initiatives, they ensure our youth are not just supported but empowered to reach their full potential. Our partners are creating a brighter tomorrow for the young people of K\u0101piti!\n\nIn the beginning K\u0101piti Run for Youth was created by Web Genius as their way as a local business to \u2018give back\u2019 to the community so, more than a decade on we can proudly say the event is sustainable and is popular with all sorts, young and old, the fit and not so fit. K\u0101piti Run for Youth has raised $280,003 for rangatahi since inception in 2011.

Whether it's a leisurely stroll or a mad dash to be the first across the finish, you choose the event that suits you best, and which of our amazing fundraising partners you're going to raise funds for. On race day grab your dog and your mates and head down to the beach for fun, family and fitness. Registration takes place from 8.30am to 9.45am with a briefing at 9.45am and all walkers and runners starting together at 10am.\n\nOnce your profile is set-up online, let your family, friends and work mates know so they can sponsor your efforts. We encourage every participant to raise $20 through sponsorship instead of paying an entry fee. All entrants receive regular campaigns to motivate their sponsorship efforts along the way.\n\nK\u0101piti Run for Youth prides itself on being a sustainable, family-friendly event that is all about supporting each other and having fun.

No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\n\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy.

    "description": "Porirua Parkrun, What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

Their prices are very reasonable.\nLooking forward to seeing you all there in your best Bokke outfits as the warm up for the following weekend's game in Wellington!\nAs you may be aware, the Bokke will be playing two games in New Zealand in September. The first game will be in Auckland on 6 September and the second on 13 September right here in Wellington.\nI have booked the Tawa Squash Club to watch the game on the 6th of September. Please mark the event as interested to get the notifications of what will be happening. ",

Located on the eastern side of Antananarivo, the capital, the orphanage was founded by the incredible Madame Hary in 2012. What started as a humble project from her own home has grown into a haven for 54 children, some of whom were rescued from areas where twins are sadly believed to be cursed.\n\nDespite the challenges, the orphanage continues to thrive, relying entirely on the kindness of visitors. They grow their own rice, maintain a small chicken farm, and have a vegetable garden to sustain themselves. But their greatest need is for ongoing support and resources to continue providing for these beautiful children.\n\nBy attending our concert, you\u2019ll be helping make a direct impact on the lives of these children. All profits from this concert will go toward completing the construction of a much-needed training center and extra bedrooms at Mamitiana Orphanage in Madagascar, helping provide valuable education and support to the children in their care.

We invite you to THEA 303\u2019s \u2018Carnival of Chaos\u2019 in Studio 77, premiering hybrid works from the House of Echoes (1 & 3 October): The Odyssey, Medea\u202fand\u202fThe Devil is a Lover, and the House of Secrets (2 & 4 October): Rope, The Taming of the Shrew\u202f and\u202f God\u2019s Gift.\n\nEach adaptation has been directed, designed, produced, choreographed and managed by the students.\n\nHouse of Echoes (Season A): Performs on the 1st and the 3rd of October\n\nThe Odyssey \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Homer\u2019s The Odyssey\nOdysseus just wants to get home to his true love, but the journey isn\u2019t exactly smooth. The streets after 2 a.m. and too many beers are alive with obstacles; cops are grumpy, goth girls are tempting, and the help of the Gods is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought. Betrayal, hurt, and anger push her to the edge making her act in ways she never thought she would. \u201cHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned.\u201d\n\nThe Devil is a Lover \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Love Labours Lost\u202fand Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Devil is an Ass\nSatan and two devils, Beelzebub and Pug, make a pact to travel to a 1920s speakeasy on Earth and abstain from corruption for 3 years. As the narrative combines absurdist actions with Shakespearean dialogue, the three devils quickly learn of the difficulties present in avoiding corruption and the effect their devilish meddling has on humanity.\n\nHouse of Secrets (Season B): Performs on the 2nd and 4th of October\n\nRope \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Patrick Hamilton\u2019s\u202fRope\u202f(1929)\nNot a\u202fwhodunnit, but a\u202fhowdoyahideit? Marion and Melanie are sure they\u2019ve committed the perfect murder by killing their friend Norman and hiding his body in a chest, a chest their select group of friends have been invited over to have a murder mystery games night around. It\u2019s foolproof, until the over analytical Constance comes to play\u2026\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew\nIn 1970's Aotearoa, sisters Katherina and Bianca find their love lives complicated by their father's order that one may not pursue romance unless the other follows suit. The sudden appearance of a charming factory owner and friend of Bianca's beau could mark a new hope for the two, but will this lead to an ocean of love or does something far more sinister lurk beneath the surface?\n\nGod\u2019s Gift \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Alchemist\nThe Carnival has come to town in 1615 London. Lovewit has gone to see the show, leaving her manor in the hands of Jeremy the Butler, the \u201cAlchemist,\u201d and Dol, a hardworking prostitute. Lovewit\u2019s house becomes a place for schemes, with ample opportunities to take money from foolish men. Will Dol be happy with her split of the money? Or will a surprise visitor shake things up?\n\nContent Forecast: mentions of and implied sexual violence and domestic abuse, mentions of drug use, strobe lighting, violence, coarse language, loud noises, haze, and smoke.",

Off the back of a monstrous summer, which saw them play 19 shows up and down the country, the pair have spent most of 2025 in the studio finessing their own brand of audio alchemy and preparing to release their label, also named XCOMMUNICATE.\n\nUsually XCOMMUNICATE is a 6 hour journey though decades and sonic realms, however as Heylady is still recovering from a mighty dose of burnout they\u2019ve roped in a couple of their good friends, who happen to be some of Wellington\u2019s finest, to join them as they lay down four hours of four to the floor.\n\nHalo is a mainstay on Wellington dancefloors and it was a no brainer asking her to be on this lineup. A DJ since 2000, she has played festivals across the country and never fails to rock her slot. Her set at Taniwha\u2019s Den last summer was a big highlight and one of the best of the festival. Halo\u2019s ability to drive forward thinking sound and her clever construction of sets are just two reasons you need to be on her floor.\n\nDJ Coda is the godfather of techno in New Zealand. With a career that spans decades, he isn\u2019t just a DJ but a dedicated promoter and one of the trustees of NZ\u2019s longest running student radio station, Radio Active. Part of the COMMUNICATE family from the get go (and a longtime collaborator of Heylady\u2019s), DJ Coda is a master of his craft and never fails to deliver. Armed with knowledge , taste and a hefty love of Detroit, DJ Coda is the man when it comes to rocking the dance floor.\nFirst release tickets are on sale now, grab yours before they are gone and come and dance the evening away with four of the best. We recommend arrive early so you don\u2019t miss out on any of the sets, they are all going to be killer.\n\nIMPORTANT INFO:\nOur event is a safe space for all. If you or someone you know is feeling unsafe or harassed, please approach one of the DJs or bar staff. If you are behaving badly and impacting others ability to have a good time safely, you will be removed. Please act with respect and care for your fellow attendees at all times, no means no and this goes for conversations as well as more intimate requests.\n\n",

The event returns to the Wairarapa Events Centre for 2025, where brides who were married between 1 July and 30 June and were married in the Wairarapa, and/or have lived or are living in the Wairarapa, and/or whose spouse has lived in the Wairarapa, will get the chance to relive the magic of their big day, donning their gowns again, all while raising much needed funds for Te Awhina Plunket Wairarapa.\n\nThis event is unique in its focus on Wairarapa\u2019s flourishing wedding industry. It is a great opportunity for couples planning their own weddings to look for inspiration from other local couples, for friends and families of brides to reminisce on the weddings. It is also an excellent opportunity to support Wairarapa Plunket and the service they provide to our community.\n\nIn 2024, the funds raised through Bride of the Year went towards purchasing equipment for use for Plunket rooms across Wairarapa along with purchase .\n\nA ticket to Bride of the Year provides you with a night of glamour and celebration of love, all while supporting Wairarapa Plunket and the service they provide to our community.",

You'll experience the opportunity to restore, recalibrate and realign your soul to its highest timeline for 2026 and beyond. This intimate event will have very limited capacity, to ensure a deep inward experience for all.\nWe will share in a sacred water ceremony with coherent water that has been structured, charged and infused with frequency- ready to be programmed with your intentions to release and shift into the new.\nNext, we will connect with a Triple Cone Orgonite meditation, further amplifying the Euphoria to all, energising your intentions and clearing the way for the shifts to come.\nWith awareness of breath and the rhythmic handpan drumming, you will gently be guided inward to begin your journey and actualize your intentions.\nThe heartbeat of the journey is a very special 30 year old handmade Buffalo drum from Utah, USA. Yana is the beat we move and breathe to, the guide and the gateway, the beat of Mother Earth. Allow her depth and resonance to take you to places you\u2019ve forgotten and re-introduce to you the primal heartbeat of humanity, of your humanity. \nAn intentional weaving of a multitude of instruments, beats and frequencies that will take you to places deep within yourself: an opportunity to explore, feel and release what no longer serves you. As we move into higher frequencies of consciousness as a collective, we are being called to clear the old- expectations, stories, beliefs, programs, conditioning and paradigms. You bring the intention and Yana will guide you into surrender, allowing all that does not serve your highest timeline to fall away.\nAnd as you gently re-emerge into the waking state, you'll experience the quiet and space to recalibrate and sink into the tenderness of renewal.\nThis journey is a sacred experience, designed to guide you through your own process. As such, this will mainly be a silent event (not social). We ask that you respect others by refraining from socializing in the space.\nNamaste\nMystic Creative",

You'll experience the opportunity to restore, recalibrate and realign your soul to its highest timeline for 2026 and beyond. This intimate event will have very limited capacity, to ensure a deep inward experience for all.\n\nWe will share in a sacred water ceremony with coherent water that has been structured, charged and infused with frequency- ready to be programmed with your intentions to release and shift into the new.\n\nNext, we will connect with a Triple Cone Orgonite meditation, further amplifying the Euphoria to all, energising your intentions and clearing the way for the shifts to come.\n\nWith awareness of breath and the rhythmic handpan drumming, you will gently be guided inward to begin your journey and actualize your intentions.\n\nThe heartbeat of the journey is a very special 30 year old handmade Buffalo drum from Utah, USA. Yana is the beat we move and breathe to, the guide and the gateway, the beat of Mother Earth. Allow her depth and resonance to take you to places you\u2019ve forgotten and re-introduce to you the primal heartbeat of humanity, of your humanity.\n\nAn intentional weaving of a multitude of instruments, beats and frequencies that will take you to places deep within yourself: an opportunity to explore, feel and release what no longer serves you. As we move into higher frequencies of consciousness as a collective, we are being called to clear the old- expectations, stories, beliefs, programs, conditioning and paradigms. You bring the intention and Yana will guide you into surrender, allowing all that does not serve your highest timeline to fall away.\n\nAnd as you gently re-emerge into the waking state, you'll experience the quiet and space to recalibrate and sink into the tenderness of renewal.\n\nThis journey is a sacred experience, designed to guide you through your own process. As such, this will mainly be a silent event (not social).\nContribution $55\nNameste\n\nNamaste\n\n",

After being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition at the age of eleven that left him paralyzed from the waist down, Wes experienced a miraculous recovery for which the doctors themselves had no medical explanation.

He spent his high school years in Northern Ontario and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and three children.\n\nWesley is currently the Central Canada Director for Apologetics Canada and has been a guest on a variety of public platforms, from The Joe Rogan Experience and Piers Morgan Uncensored, to Apologia Radio and Daily Dose of Wisdom. He has participated in numerous public dialogues, debates, and interfaith events on issues of belief and religion globally.\n\nHe holds a BA in sociology from York University, a Masters of Theological Studies from Tyndale University, and is currently doing a PhD in New Testament at the University of Toronto\u2019s Wycliffe College.\n\n",

The live sound journey adds another layer \u2014 resonant frequencies that ripple through the body, calming the nervous system and encouraging inner stillness.\n\nEmma offers a trauma-informed yin practice grounded in compassion and self-awareness, drawing on her own personal growth and understanding of what it means to truly rest.

Her approach to teaching yin is purposeful, driven by a strong desire to empower students through mindful and compassionate practices. Her journey is rooted in self-growth and connection, with a strong focus on nourishing the body as an essential part of this.\n\nMeet Alex, your sound healer\nAlex is a sound healing practitioner devoted to nurturing healing in both mind and body. She believes that sound vibration holds the power to expand consciousness and restore harmony and balance in our lives. Her journey into sound healing began with the realization of how deeply sound vibration was affecting her psyche\u2014making her more mindful of the music she listens to and the intention it carries. Along the way, she has drawn inspiration from artists such as Deva Premal, The Flying Mystics, Stevin McNamara, and the Bhakti Lounge Kirtan.

Since we will be viewing and discussing potentially sensitive topics, the event will have an Open Door Policy, which means that you may leave the venue any time, for any reason, and will not be judged for doing so.\nWHAT IS MARTIAL LAW?\n\"Martial law refers to the replacement of civil rule by military rule. This may be characterized by curfews, the dispensation of military tribunal rulings on civilians, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, which in Latin refers to \u201chaving the body\u201d, is a citizen\u2019s protection against unlawful imprisonment. This is suspended in times of crisis to expedite justice\" (Martial Law Museum).\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY?\nHuman rights violations and extrajudicial killings are still on-going in the Philippines under President Bongbong Marcos, the son of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. who proclaimed Martial Law in 1972, and Vice President Sara Duterte, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte who spearheaded the violent War on Drugs in 2016 (Karapatan).\nWHY WOULD I WANT TO JOIN THE FILM SCREENING?\nThe film screening is for anyone who is keen to learn about the Martial Law Era, wants to share their experience during the Martial Law (or something similar) through group discussion, wants to meet new people, wants to watch a Philippine film/documentary, or just wants to have snacks.\nI WANT TO JOIN BUT I'M FROM T\u0100MAKI MAKAURAU / CHRISTCHURCH / THE PHILIPPINES.\nWe will stream the film through Zoom for viewers outside Te Whanganui-a-Tara, however, there may be internet and other technical difficulties during the event itself. Also please make sure to select the \"Online\" ticket option when RSVPing.\nHOW MUCH IS THE TICKET?\nThe film screening is free but we appreciate koha for the venue/snacks/donations to Philippine non-governmental organisations (NGOs).\nNOTE: This is an LGBTQ+ friendly event.",

    "description": "Mystery 35mm Movie Marathon, Details\nUPDATE - We have added some Half Marathon ticket options for those can't make the whole event. You can either select 'Daytime' or 'Evening' which will let you watch three features total. Daytime tickets are from 1:30pm until the dinner break (around 7:00pm). Evening are from the dinner break until the end of the last film.\n\nSurprise we are running a 35mm Mystery Marathon very soon! We have had some exciting news that we cannot share for now but as a result we must move our beautiful 35mm from its usual location into storage for a bit. We are not sure when it will be set back up so to celebrate we are running a marathon of six 35mm features across one Saturday!\n\nWe will kick off the first film at 1:30pm sharp on Saturday and will have a short dinner break after the third film. All going to plan we should be done by around 12:30am.\n\nIn terms of the features, we have films from the 1960s through to the early 2000s with a mix of comedies, sci-fi, horror and cult classics! Granted not all of these films would be considered masterpieces but there is nothing more fun than sitting in a crowd not knowing what could be coming next!\n\nWe will have a snack menu you can pre-order before the first film so aim to arrive around 1:00pm to order. The breaks between films will be very short (probably just enough time for the projectionist to thread up the next film) so make sure you come prepared for back-to-back screenings.\n\nThis event has strictly no digital projection, it\u2019s all film all the time. Now in theory it should all playback without a hitch as we are bringing in some of the best projectionist\u2019s Wellington has. But 35mm is a strange beast that can sometimes throw up the odd issue.\n\nFull marathon tickets (Admit) are $50\nHalf Marathon - Daytime are $30\nHalf Marathon - Evening are $30\n\nSeating is general admission and cinema entrance will be determined by earliest ticket purchase times.",

    "description": "British and Irish Film Festival - A Room with a View, A Room With a View captured the attention of the world upon its release, bringing the novel by E.M. Forster to dazzling life in the Florentine countryside and in the well-appointed homes of the English Edwardian upper classes. A comedy of manners with a quick wit and impeccable comic timing, A Room With A View is also a portrait of the quiet solitude that lies beneath Forster\u2019s characters, and of the need for human connection in a world of rigid convention.\n\nThe young Englishwoman Lucy Honeychurch (played by Helena Bonham Carter), arrives in Florence on a Baedecker-style grand tour with her aunt Charlotte Bartlett (Maggie Smith). Through a series of events involving English expatriates Miss Eleanor Lavish, an unflappable novelist (Judi Dench), and the Emersons, a free-thinking father and son (played by Denholm Elliot and Julian Sands), Lucy\u2019s life is changed forever under a loggia in Florence and in the Tuscan countryside.\n\nIvory\u2019s delicate and playful direction spirits us from an adventure in the back alleys of Florence, lost with Dench and Smith, to the lace-parasolled rigidity of English lawn parties. Shot on location in and around Florence (including unforgettable scenes in the Piazza della Signoria and at Giotto\u2019s frescoes in Santa Croce), A Room With A View made stars not only of Bonham Carter, Day Lewis and Sands, but of the Tuscan landscapes and Puccini arias (as sung by Kiri Te Kanawa) featured throughout.\n\nDirector\nJames Ivory\n\nProducer\nIsmail Merchant\n\nCast\nMaggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Denholm Elliot, Julian Sands",

    "description": "NZIFF: Sex, Returning from last year\u2019s Festival to screen alongside the rest of his Sex Dreams Love trilogy, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s comic drama takes a candid and refreshing look at modern gender roles.\n\nThere has hardly been any investigation on contemporary male identity and sexuality as candid, insightful and hilarious as Norwegian auteur Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Sex. After winning all major laurels in Nordic cinema with his impressive fresco Beware of Children (2019), the acclaimed director and author embarkson an Oslo-set trilogy simply called Sex Dreams Love.\n\nThe first instalment opens on one of the most tantalising and unexpected preludes in recent cinema. Two chimney sweeps frankly open up to each other on a coffee break in their office: the first reveals that he dreamt of being intensely looked at by none other than David Bowie, who was inspecting him as if he was a woman; the other confesses that he recently accepted the sexual advances of a male customer who asked him to have sex with him. But both men are \u201cstraight\u201d and married to women. Here, the deft tone of the film and Haugerud\u2019s rules of the game are immediately set.\n\nA fervent admirer of Eric Rohmer\u2019s thickly scripted skirmishes of love and ethics, the Norwegian writer-director infuses irony, depth and compassion in each of his elegantly composed tableaux depicting how the two men cope with the turmoil these experiences bring to their relationships with their partners and family, but most of all with themselves. Featuring some of the brightest and funniest dialogues of 2024, Sex is a real eye-opener. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

This will be in the Student Union, Memorial Theatre (SUMT 228; follow signage), Te Herenga Waka Vitoria University of Wellington (entrance via Kelburn Parade). See map of the campus here.\nLes Parapluies de Cherbourg (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg), \nJacques Demy, 1964 (91 minutes).\nWith Catherine Deneuve and music by Michel Legrand.\nThere will be an introduction and a Q&A discussion after the film.\n In Les Parapluies de Cherbourg, Jacques Demy transforms a simple love story into an enchanting and bittersweet musical. In the rain-soaked port of Cherbourg, Genevi\u00e8ve, played by Catherine Deneuve, propelled to stardom after her first major role, and Guy (Nino Castelnuovo) are separated when he is drafted for war in Algeria. Every line is sung (Michel Legrand is the film composer), every emotion is painted in luminous hues (poetic realism meets pop art), as Demy fuses everyday realism with operatic stylisation. Beneath its pastel beauty lies melancholy: love eroded by class, an unpopular colonial war and social conventions. Demy\u2019s art finds poetry in artifice, a fragile harmony between dream, music, and loss. Winner of the Palme d\u2019Or at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival.\n In his introduction to the film and in its subsequent Q&A session, Assoc. Prof.  Thierry Jutel (who, like Jacques Demy, hails from Nantes) along with Dr Missy Molloy from the Film Programme at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington will discuss the iconic status of the film in French popular culture and its influence on generations of filmmakers. This will be Dr Jutel\u2019s last public lecture at Victoria prior to his retirement.\n An event facilitated by the support of Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington and the Embassy of France in Wellington.",

Distance and death became everyday realities for Kiwis at home \u2013 and caused griefs that were at times taboo and suppressed.\n\nDame Gaylene Preston frames seven women, including her own mother, against a black background that creates a stage for their candid, unadorned and surprisingly intimate wartime recollections, as they look back from the 90s in interviews conducted by oral historian Judith Fyfe. The acclaimed documentary, which combines these shared testimonies with personal photographs and newsreel clips, conveys the immense pressure to conform to the value of stoic sacrifice for the cause under the scrutinising eye of neighbours, and reveals lesser-seen layers of resilience.\n\nMarriages in the first flush of romance were cut short, pregnancies were navigated alone, conscientious objectors were met with ostracisation and American servicemen scorned, in a nation united around support of their boys in combat overseas \u2013 a state of affairs in which women were often granted little voice, as they took on more labour, and absorbed life-changing losses. \u2014 Carmen Gray",

As emotional walls come down, doubts arise: is there more to the care offered than simple kindness?\n\nLaura and Betty seem to be poles apart. Laura, a young, city dwelling music student, lives in an apartment with her boyfriend; Betty has an adult son and lives alone in rural Germany. Their lives are thrown together after a car accident leaves Laura in the care of the older woman. Despite ostensible differences, each recognises a familiar melancholy in the other. As a tentative trust grows, the women find something unlocking within themselves, even as complicating factors emerge, in the form of Betty\u2019s opaque family situation.\n\nMaster dramatist Christian Petzold reunites with frequent acting collaborator Paula Beer (Transit, Undine, Afire) and regular DOP Hans Fromm, turning his pen and camera to a smaller scale domestic drama. Mirrors No. 3 (named for a Ravel piano piece played within) makes visual and thematic echoes back to Petzold\u2019s previous work: from extended bike rides down rural lanes (Barbara), to the centrality of a piano (Phoenix), as well as the thread of mysterious tension that underlies them all. The film revels in the messy, stimulating complexities of human relationships, exploring the way that sometimes even questionable motivations can affect positive outcomes. \u2014 Jacob Powell",

    "description": "NZIFF: Sentimental Value, This film may touch on the familiar theme of how artists draw from their own lives, but Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgard bring incredible tenderness to a story that is ultimately about what children and parents never say to one another \u2014 and whether those lifelong silences can ever be broken.\nCollaborating again with frequent co-writer Eskil Vogt (now also a successful director), Trier fashions a nuanced look at both a troubled family and a dysfunctional film industry. (Gustav\u2019s comeback project will be distributed through Netflix, and the divisive streamer is the target of a couple of the screenplay\u2019s better barbs.) Much of Sentimental Value takes place in the Borg family\u2019s home, and an efficient flashback, framed as an essay Nora wrote as a girl, explains how they have lived in the house for generations\u2026 That slightly fading family home becomes an apt metaphor for the weathered bond Nora, Agnes and Gustav share, although Reinsve\u2019s fragile performance articulates the festering resentment she feels toward her absent father.\nTrier\u2019s third picture to screen at Cannes, after 2021\u2019s The Worst Person In The World\u2019s breakout lead Reinsve won Best Actress, the reunion of director and star will entice arthouse crowds\u2026 and those seeking a smart, thoughtful tearjerker should be pleased with this sentimental but farfrom-mawkish film.\u201d \u2014 Tom Grierson, Screen Daily",

Writing with courage and insight, he was a lover of language and a champion of the underdog.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1978, Bruce toured the country, telling uniquely Kiwi stories about emerging identity, cultural cringe and social difference. From church halls to country shearing sheds to the Edinburgh Festival, Bruce would play anywhere, in any circumstance, to any audience.\n\nTo celebrate his extraordinary legacy, Brilliant Adventures and Circa Theatre are collaborating to make two of his greatest solo works resound for a new age.\n\nTwo plays: timeless, universal, distinct. Following their critically acclaimed, sold out run of THINGS I KNOW TO BE TRUE, actor Stephen Lovatt and director Shane Bosher return to Circa for a not-to-be missed theatrical encounter with a master craftsman.\n\nTHE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER\n\u201cI invite you to join me, in a voyage into the past, to that territory of the heart we call childhood.\u201d\n\nBruce Mason\u2019s quintessential Kiwi classic chronicles the friendship between a 12-year-old boy and Firpo, a social outcast who dreams of winning an Olympic medal.\n\nThrough the boy\u2019s eyes we see the wonder of life on a perfect beach, in a perfect 1930s New Zealand, during a perfect summer. It\u2019s a world of magic and transformation, where anything can happen and miracles seem possible.\n\nWhen the boy sets out to help Firpo make his athletic dream a reality, ignoring his father\u2019s rebukes and community ridicule, a battle rages between the eternal optimism of childhood and the harsh pragmatism of adulthood.\n\nGliding effortlessly between flights of poetic fancy and blunt everyday speech, THE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER is New Zealand storytelling at its very best.\n\nNOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES\nAn adolescent boy tries to find his place in an adult-dominated world. A young man retraces an intensely felt boyhood experience of bullying. A playwright in his last days reconciles the value of an artistic life and challenges the idea of New Zealand identity.\n\nComic disasters and confronting your own hubris. NOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES is a richly autobiographical search for self-expression. Profound and true, it is a set of variations about over-reaching, cheekily confronting our very own Tall Poppy Syndrome.\n\nCelebrating Bruce Mason\nDirected by Shane Bosher\nPerformed by Stephen Lovatt\n\nThursday 20 November to Saturday 13 December\nPreview Night: Wed 19 Nov \u2013 The End of the Golden Weather\nPreview Night: Fri 21 Nov \u2013 Not Christmas, But Guy Fawkes\nSunday Special: Sunday 23 November \u2013 The End of the Golden Weather\nQ&A: Tuesday 25 November\nChoose Your Price Night: Wed 26 November \u2013 Not Christmas, But Guy Fawkes\nCirca Two\nTues \u2013 Fri 7.30pm, Sat 4.30pm & 7.30pm, Sun 4.30pm\n$30 \u2013 $60 Early Bird Tickets Available\n\nProductions play on alternate nights with an opportunity to see both productions in conversation with each other on Saturdays",

    "description": "Teaching Well - A supportive school for a well staff - Wellington (TWS2025/04), Growing attention to staff wellbeing has resulted in many workplace mental wellbeing initiatives. Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 20% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions. Post workshop consulting services such as mentoring the development of or reviewing a staff wellbeing plan can also be provided.\nPost Workshop Consult:\nSchools and Kuras have the option of a 90 minute consult with Barry in 2026 to review their staff wellbeing plan.\nAN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNING WITH INTERNATIONALLY RESPECTED AND AWARD WINNING MENTAL WELLBEING PRACTITIONER AND SUICIDOLOGIST, BARRY TAYLOR\nBarry has worked in mental wellbeing promotion and suicide prevention/postvention for 37 years at the local, national and international levels.  His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs.  He has worked extensively with schools both here and overseas supporting management and staff in the event of a suicide. He wrote the first suicide postvention guidelines for schools in 1990, developed the first national suicide prevention guidelines for schools in Australia in 1999 and reviewed and updated the NZ guidelines in 2010.\nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.  In recognition of his outstanding contribution to mental wellbeing and suicide prevention, he was awarded in 2016 the NSW Mental Health Commissioner's Community Champion Award.\nBarry has lectured on wellbeing both nationally and internationally and been appointed to numerous government advisory committees on mental wellbeing and suicide prevention.  He brings to this workshop extensive experience in advising communities and government on post-disaster recovery in terms of both mental wellbeing promotion / community resiliency and suicide prevention.\nAs a Health Sociologist and Public Health practitioner, Barry has a long-term interest in the social and cultural determinants of wellbeing, especially the role of gender and he brings a wealth of knowledge and passion for promoting wellbeing in men. He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing. He uses a population health and systems change approach, drawing on transformational change theory and collective impact.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to promote well wh\u0101nau, workplaces and communities and for the incorporation of wellbeing principles in public policy and social outcomes such as education, training and employment.\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

Sounds fab? :)\nIf so then DM me or email to confirm, and i'll book you in on the 3rd of December or if you are just one of those bizzy Lizzy's like me and you forgot to book, then just feel free to rock up or text me which i will give you access to when you email\n\nWhere:\n1.Johnsonville Public Library\n2.Upstairs in a Private space\n3.10am -12pm Just ask person at the desk where to go if you are unsure\n\np.s Great coffee shop next door on the same level :) or bring your own coffee or tea in a flask if that's what you prefer as I know some people are particular with their drinks :)\n\n\n",

    "description": "Inner Child Workshop - Shamanic Way, Inner Child Healing \u2013 Shamanic Way\nInner child healing has been explored in many therapeutic and healing modalities. Each approach offers its own wisdom and light, helping people in unique ways. What truly transformed my journey, however, is the foundational practice within my shamanic training \u2014 Inner Child Healing. It\u2019s not an intellectual or analytical process, but a deeply intuitive and feeling-based journey that helps us dive into the psyche and reconnect with younger versions of ourselves that may have become lost or stuck in time.\n\nIn shamanic practice, we understand the inner child as a deeply activated part of the nervous system. In other words, healing your inner child means bringing safety to your nervous system, allowing the wounded part of you \u2014 the one constantly on alert \u2014 to finally rest. Your inner child is your nervous system. When that child feels safe, seen, and loved within your body, they can simply be the child they were never allowed to be. At that point, you no longer need to constantly \u201cregulate\u201d your nervous system through endless spiritual practices \u2014 because much of what gets triggered in daily life often comes from an unmet or unhappy inner child.\n\nOnce you learn to create a safe internal space for your inner child to simply be, and allow your embodied, grounded adult self to take responsibility in life, you\u2019ll witness profound shifts in how you feel, respond, and relate to the world.\n\nIn this workshop, I will share the foundational understanding of how inner child healing unfolds in everyday life. Through a guided shamanic journey, you\u2019ll be led to meet or reconnect with your inner child and begin integrating a healthy adult archetype within your system.\n\nIf you feel called to explore your inner child, work on a deeper, more embodied level \u2014 one that you can carry into your daily life \u2014\njoin me this Labour Weekend at Capricorn Spirit Crystal Shop, from 3pm to 6pm.\nSpaces are limited to 6 participants, and I look forward to journeying with you there.

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods. Her works have appeared in the Politics, International Politics, Political Science, PS: Political Science & Politics, Journal of Contemporary China, Pacific Review, and Asian Security.\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 04:30 PM - 05:30 PM\nWelcome reception with refreshments and light catering\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 06:30 PM\nKeynote address: Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal Intern\nHost: Christina Lai\n\n\n",

    "description": "Minilateralism: a new page in the Indo-Pacific IR lexicon, Minilateralism has emerged as a defining feature of contemporary international relations, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, despite its growing prominence, the conceptual boundaries of this form of cooperation remain underdeveloped. This seminar addresses this gap by proposing a comparative framework that distinguishes minilateralism from other established modes of cooperation\u2014not only bilateralism and multilateralism, but also plurilateralism and regionalism. Through this analytical distinction, the study clarifies the conceptual contours of minilateralism and illuminates its purposive and exclusive character. By advancing a sharper theoretical understanding, this research contributes to the conceptual lexicon of international relations and enhances our grasp of cooperation dynamics in the Indo-Pacific.\n Mr Ryosuke Hanada is a PhD candidate and Sessional Teaching Staff at the School of International Studies, Macquarie University. He was a Research Fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs (JIIA), researching Japan\u2019s foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific region from 2016 to 2020.

The establishment of a nuclear free zone has served as inspiration\nworldwide, yet, despite this, the nuclear issue remains relevant to New Zealand. As long as\nnuclear weapons exist, their environmental, humanitarian and geopolitical impacts extend far\nbeyond the borders of nuclear weapon states.\nThis panel and fireside chat seeks to situate New Zealand\u2019s position within the global\nnuclear landscape, exploring why the issue continues to matter to a nuclear free country,\nhighlighting the interconnected impacts of these weapons, whilst also considering New\nZealand\u2019s role as a disarmament leader.",

The failure and harm caused by the so called 'War on Drugs' is acknowledged globally and witnessed first hand here in Aotearoa New Zealand.\n\nBack in 2011 a comprehensive review of the MoDA conducted by New Zealand Law Commission recommended the MoDA \u201cshould be repealed and replaced by a new Act \u2026administered by the Ministry of Health\u201d.

Despite the repeated failure of standard policy processes, citizens assemblies have only recently made it to New Zealand. Register for this event to find out more about the Porirua Assembly on Climate and its innovations. \nPorirua is known for community-led innovations in governance and delivery, and the Porirua Assembly on Climate continued this tradition by being:\nthe first climate assembly in New Zealand,  \nthe first assembly co-designed and organised by an iwi authority and a community group, \nthe first assembly process designed to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi by using a tricameral design,  \nthe first New Zealand assembly to include children and young people, and \nby creating a new local governance body - the Porirua Community Leaders Forum - that sponsored the Assembly, holds its recommendations and can instigate ongoing community dialogue on local issues. \nPanellists will share learning on the Porirua Assembly\u2019s innovations, talk about why the standard citizens assembly model was modified, dig into what enabled so many firsts and how these worked out in practice. They will reflect on this legacy and possible future impacts. Might these democratic innovations strengthen local democracy elsewhere in Aotearoa New Zealand? \nAbout the Host and Speakers\nJodi Watene is a Systems Change Lead at Te R\u016bnanga o Toa Rangatira Incorporated, was the project manager for the Porirua Assembly and is helping to establish a New Zealand Community of Practice on Indigenous Citizens\u2019 Assemblies.\nMakerita Makapelu is a Team Leader for Wesley Community Action in Porirua with a background in performing arts and youth work. She specialises in community-led development and grassroots systems change, and was one of the Porirua Assembly facilitators.  \nCally O'Neill was a participatory designer of community spaces until 2019 when she shifted her focus towards advocating for Te Tiriti-based deliberative democracy to address the climate and other contemporary crises.

We have ordered 500 special trees from the Berhampore Nursery. We are in this for the long haul and a forest that contains a wide range of plant species will, in turn, attract a wider range of birds, lizards, and invertebrates. A wider range of plant species also allows for the forest to naturally regenerate and helps prevent weed species from establishing.\nTools are provided, bring sturdy shoes and a water bottle, Working bees are held every Sunday in June (except June 1st - Kings Birthday Weekend) and August 2025.\nMeeting at the Information Shelter in the Tapu te Ranga Marae car park at the end of Danube Street in Island Bay.

    "description": "Wairarapa Walking Festival 2025: Aorangi Forest Park Old Mill Track, Join the Aorangi Restoration Trust and South Wairarapa locals for a walk along a recently restored track in Aorangi Forest Park. Follow an old logging road to the historic mill site and take in the beauty of the regenerating forest along the way.\n\nAorangi Forest Park stretches between Martinborough in the north and Cape Palliser in the south, covering much of the Aorangi mountains. By road, the park sits about 80 km south of Masterton and 100 km east of Wellington.\n\nThe park is located on Department of Conservation land and features a rich variety of native bush. Beech forest dominates the northern range, while hinau and matai are common in the hardwood forests at lower altitudes. Mahoe thrives on moist soils in gullies and along stream banks. Other species include fuchsia, makomako, heketara, kohuhu, titoki, rewarewa, rimu, and miro, creating a diverse and vibrant landscape.\n\nWalk Format\nMeet at 16 Kitchener Street, Martinborough for shuttle transport to the start of this route. The walk itself is a 10km return trip, expected to take 5 hours. It is a fairly easy tramping track - with about 500 metres of more difficult terrain due to the unformed nature of the track and moderate slope at the start. The remainder is gradual slope on a good benched track. We will return to 16 Kitchener Street between 4pm and 5pm.\n\nImportant\nOnce registered, please check your email for the gear list. This walk is partly in cellphone coverage. This walk will be postponed till Sunday 23rd November if there has been significant rain and the river is too high. Tickets will be refunded if cancelled.",
