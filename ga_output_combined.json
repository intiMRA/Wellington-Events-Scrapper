Rooted in ancestral echoes, each story is poetic, powerful, and fleeting; never to be told the same way twice.\n\nInspired by the workshop The Stories That Made Us, the show blends magical realism, oral tradition, and ensemble connection.\n\nWith previous presentations in Auckland and Brisbane (as part of the 2025 Brisbane Improv Festival), Bonfire now arrives at the New Zealand Improv Festival, inviting audiences into a space of warmth, wonder, and shared humanity.\n\nThis show may include content related to family, identity, cultural heritage, and emotional themes. While performers are encouraged to approach these with care and sensitivity, the improvised nature of the show means themes may vary each night. The show may contain voluntary audience interaction, such as giving a suggestion for a scene.",

Since leaving her home in the UK in 2019, she\u2019s moved across the world, worked remotely from a van, taught graphic design in China, and rebuilt her creative career more than once.\nToday, she blends her love of design with a passion for helping other creatives navigate the highs, lows, and mindset shifts of freelance life, while inspiring those around her to pursue their own dreams.\nIn this Friday's talk, she shares the unfiltered truths of freelancing on the move - from creative burnout to financial uncertainty - along with the mindset tools that can make the journey not just survivable, but meaningful and joyful.

Shut her eyes. Rolled their names around her brain. Stacked each person in order like folded laundry, warm and crisp from the sun. She wondered how her name would sound amongst them.\n\nIn the rural reaches of Auckland, the women of the eclectic Gordon family gather for Christmas. They may push each other\u2019s buttons, but know precisely when to offer tea (or a tipple). Rita, the 50-year-old baby of the family, is planning to tell them she has cancer. Drifting between past and present, she considers the lives of women in their community and reckons with what it all means for her future and her family.\n\nFeaturing elderly lesbians, twins who aren\u2019t twins, and several dogs named Roger, Hoods Landing is about shoddy pasts, ambiguous futures and the imperfect bonds that tie family together.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nLaura Vincent (Ng\u0101ti M\u0101hanga, Ng\u0101puhi) is an author whose work spans fiction, poetry and food writing. She has written the food blog hungryandfrozen.com since 2007, and her debut cookbook was published by Penguin Random House in 2013. Laura\u2019s poetry has appeared in anthologies published by \u0100poro Press, Auckland University Press and Muswell Press, and she completed her Master of Creative Writing at Auckland University of Technology in 2022. Born in Waiuku, Laura currently lives in T\u0101maki Makaurau. Hoods Landing is her first novel.\n\n",

But who says? Whose progress and whose AI is it anyway? Is societal progress really bound to technological innovation, or are there other ways of reading - and even shaping - positive social change?\nTechnological Determinism is described as the belief system that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an \"inevitable\" course.\" This panel will take a good hard look at this 'inevitabilism' - its forces and politics - with a view to our shared future in Aotearoa and the Pacific.\nJoin us for a rigorous evening of discussion with a view to how we might gain more understanding - and more say - as to the reach and influence new technologies have over our autonomy, dignity, communities and cultures.",

    "description": "MAMIL 2: GOMIL, MAMIL 2: GOMIL\nThe Lycra is back: GOMIL \u2013 the hilarious new sequel to MAMIL hits the road across New Zealand!\n\nOne of New Zealand\u2019s biggest theatrical success stories is back in the saddle! Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it's going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa. Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you're a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show digs deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, family, and the undeniable need to keep moving\u2014no matter how creaky your knees may be.\n\nGet ready to laugh, reflect, and maybe even wince in recognition as GOMIL pedals its way across the country this spring. It\u2019s more than a show\u2014it\u2019s a celebration of growing older (and slightly wider) with humour, heart, and a healthy dose of spandex.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next chapter in this iconic Kiwi comedy saga. GOMIL is coming to a theatre near you - lycra, laughter and all.\n\n--\nFor accessibility seating information and wheelchair space bookings please email or call 04)9740535 during office hours.\n\n",

I moved to beautiful Aotearoa from Sweden a few years ago, and my journey with ceramics started in 2023 and I've been elbows deep in clay ever since. I use flora found all over the world, and outside my doorsteps, to shape my artwork. My ceramic pieces are all hand made and no piece will be the other alike. I mainly throw a shape on the wheel and then let it tell me what it wants to become.\nThis exhibition is guided by Ecclesiastes 3:1-11. I think life is beautiful in it's times of joy, but also in the times of struggle, where we can grow and learn.\nA Time for Everything\nThere is a time for everything,\nand a season for every activity under the heavens:\na time to be born and a time to die,\na time to plant and a time to uproot,\na time to kill and a time to heal,\na time to tear down and a time to build,\na time to weep and a time to laugh,\na time to mourn and a time to dance,\na time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,\na time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,\na time to search and a time to give up,\na time to keep and a time to throw away,\na time to tear and a time to mend,\na time to be silent and a time to speak,\na time to love and a time to hate,\na time for war and a time for peace.\nWhat do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.\n",

Three mixed-race artists from across Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui \u2014 Carmel Aroha Salmanzadeh, Jessica Miku and Anthony Zemke \u2014 trace the echoes of matrilineal language and culture, reaching for words that live in their mothers\u2019 voices but not their own. The show speaks to the intricacies of love, loss, grief and gratitude. To inherit a tongue but not its fluency is to stand at the threshold of intimacy \u2014 close enough to hear it, yet unable to fully enter. At its heart are nine paintings that pursue a multifaceted visual language that expresses the artists\u2019 ability (or inability) to connect without language.\nTo love without saying \u201cI love you\u201d \u2013 \u201cka nui taku aroha ki a koe\u201d / \u201d\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0645\u201d / \u201c\u3044\u3064\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u201d\nAnthony Zemke (b. 1998, Aotearoa) is an Iranian-P\u0101keh\u0101 illustrator and painter based in T\u0101maki Makaurau.\nWorking within a conceptual framework guided by the Baha\u2019i teachings, Eastern mysticism, and Continental philosophy, Zemke\u2019s practice sees abstraction as the ideal vehicle for communicating psychosocial and spiritual realities. His works explore the boundaries of language, the dialectic of human oneness and diversity, and the various dimensions of radical compassion.\nCarmel Salmanzadeh (b. 2002, T\u0101maki Makaurau) is of M\u0101ori, Iranian, Samoan and Chinese descent. He uri t\u0113nei n\u014d Ng\u0101ti Hauaa, Waikato, Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti, Ng\u0101ti Ira me Ng\u0101ti Porou. Salmanzadeh traces links\nbetween the pictorial languages and motifs used in the traditional and indigenous practices of her multiethnic\nwhakapapa; exploring how visual narratives transcend cultural boundaries. Manifested in large-scale pieces, their works are influenced by the structure and design of Persian carpets, Samoan siapo and M\u0101ori taniko.\nJessica Miku (b. 2000, Whang\u0101rei) is a Japanese/P\u0101keh\u0101 artist based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Using the Japanese cultural anthropological concept Hare-Ke, which harmonises the fantastical with the mundane, they produce paintings of imagined female figures within ecological fantasy. These portals of otherworldliness are used to explore notions of tenderness\u2014in heart, soul, and flesh.\nPromotional Design by Tamara Irvine\nThis exhibition will be accompanied by a written work by Yue Pibrow ",

The Opera\u2014a fresh and engaging retelling of Little Red Riding Hood\u2014invites audiences of all ages to experience opera in a new, interactive way.\n\nThis vibrant one-act opera takes the well-loved story and gives it a bold, modern twist. Red is no longer a passive heroine but a spirited and resourceful young girl who learns to stand up for herself. Along the way she encounters a mischievous Wolf, a feisty Granny, and a host of colourful characters who bring the forest to life with humour, warmth, and plenty of surprises.\n\nAt the heart of Red! is participation. Children take an active role in shaping the performance\u2014creating sound effects, movements, and responses that become part of the show. Their voices blend with professional singers and musicians, making every performance unique and alive with energy. The result is a joyful celebration of music, storytelling, and community.\n\nMulgan\u2019s score is witty, playful, and sophisticated, full of catchy rhythms, lyrical arias, and imaginative textures. It captures the drama and comedy of the tale while remaining approachable and fun for newcomers to opera. Both seasoned opera-goers and first-time audiences will find themselves swept up in the sparkle and charm of this inventive work.\n\nWith its empowering message, interactive spirit, and musical brilliance, Red! is an opera for today\u2019s families\u2014offering laughter, excitement, and a reminder that even the smallest voices can make themselves heard.\n\n",

Despite barely being able to feed themselves due to crippling food shortages caused by international sanctions, the family is randomly selected to prepare a cake as part of the forced national spectacle observing Saddam Hussein\u2019s birthday.\n\nFrom bucolic wetlands to bustling city streets, Lamia embarks on an ingredient-hunting odyssey that mixes equal parts sweet absurdity and bitter reality. Bartering with hawkers, dodging authorities, and begging the kindness of strangers, the young girl encounters the full gamut of humanity, from good to grotesque, as she approaches her ludicrous mission with innocent determination.\n\nDirector Hasan Hadi deftly evokes humour and open heartedness against a bleak background of oppression and war. Cinematographer Tudor Vladimir Panduru summons rich texture from the gorgeous locations, beautifully backed by a flowing soundtrack of traditional strings. \u2014 Adrian Hatwell",

Featuring quintessential songs from the jazz age, you can rely on a wonderful evening to wash away the worries of the 21st century.\n\nThe modern jazz style often incorporates many harsher elements in order to stand out, which can be very engaging. But it often demands attention, and radiates a tense atmosphere. Vintage jazz tends to prioritize an easy listening experience, with lyrical melodies and traditional music harmony.\n\nSettle into a chair, take a sip of wine, and let the smooth harmonies flow over you!\n\nFeaturing:\n\nPiano: Daniel Harris\nTrombone: Ferdinand Hitchings-Anstice\nBass: Zachary Chyr\nDrums: Oscar Garvie",

    "description": "The Inevitabilism Panel, We're told AI is Progress, progress that cannot be stopped, that it will change the way we work and live, from business to education and the commons. But who says? Whose progress and whose AI is it anyway? Is societal progress really bound to technological innovation, or are there other ways of reading - and even shaping - positive social change?\nTechnological Determinism is described as the belief system that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an \"inevitable\" course.\" This panel will take a good hard look at this 'inevitabilism' - its forces and politics - with a view to our shared future in Aotearoa and the Pacific.\nJoin us for a rigorous evening of discussion with a view to how we might gain more understanding - and more say - as to the reach and influence new technologies have over our autonomy, dignity, communities and cultures.",

These pressures will require careful planning to ensure the sustainability of government finances while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the tax system.\nInland Revenue\u2019s draft Long-Term Insights Briefing explores these issues by asking critical questions about the future shape and scale of our tax system. Similarly, the Treasury\u2019s Long-Term Fiscal Statement highlights the importance of future-proofing our tax framework and other broader policy settings to address these challenges.\nJoin us for this seminar delivered by a highly regarded economist and expert in tax policy and administration, and a prolific author, Michael Keen, as he shares his insights on future proofing our tax system.\nThis will be a hybrid event, and we encourage you to attend it in person for an opportunity to engage in a discussion on all those issues with our guest speaker.\nAbout this event\nThis will be a hybrid event. Please use this site to register if you plan to attend it in person.\nIf you would like to attend it virtually, please use THIS LINK to register.\nThe Tax Policy Charitable Trust has arranged Mick\u2019s visit to New Zealand.

ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!! This booking is for FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER\n                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cWithin the DNA is written not only our histories as individuals but the whole history of the human race \u2026 patterns of DNA that have come down to us virtually unchanged from our distant ancestors \u2013 ancestors who are no longer just an abstract entity but real people who lived in conditions very different from those we enjoy today, who survived them and brought up their children.\u201d ~ Bryan Sykes (The Seven Daughters of Eve)\nReturn to MAIN EXHIBITION WEBSITE - link coming soon",

It is designed for advanced students and focuses on teaching a range of claw setting techniques, along with straightforward construction methods to securely hold gemstones of various shapes and sizes.

They can also bring their own half made ring shanks or other projects to set into.\nThey will start by creating claw settings for flat-bottomed stones on plate to gain an understanding of how claws work.\nStudents will then move on to faceted stones and be shown how to construct their own settings in a number of styles, and how to secure their stones in settings. Finally, they will be taught the dos and don\u2019ts of finishing settings to a salable level.\nThe workshop will also look at how to use pre-made claw settings to best advantage.\nWorkshop fee $245, Early bird $221 till 27 July.

    "description": "Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days, Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days\nThis workshop is ideal for advanced students who have already learned how to set cabochon stones. Over two three-hour sessions, 20 and 27 September, 10am-1pm, you will be given an understanding of the technique of setting faceted stones using a setting burr, hammers, punches and burnishing tools. This is the first step in learning to flush set facet cut stones so they sit below the surface of the metal.\n\nSession 1 will cover the technique, demonstrations and the basics of preparing and cutting the setting. Students will be shown how to set their stones, and may begin to do this in class, but will then go on to repeat and practice the technique in their own time.\nThey can do this at home, or for a small extra cost, can stay on at the studio to practice setting for the afternoon.\n\nSession 2 will pick up on the setting techniques, reminding and refining essential steps in the process. Troubleshooting can be covered in this class, as well as learning to clean up the settings. The principles of this setting technique will be covered in a few different scenarios, as some students may wish to take this skill into different styles or directions.\n\nThe option for students to have a half-day bench hire after class will also apply to this session.\n\nWhat is provided: class fees cover your practice metal (copper) and stones (CZ) and detailed handouts that are useful for you to take away to refer to when practising and honing your skills.\n\nCorrectly sized drills and setting burrs will be provided in class, but students must purchase their own burrs for practice after class and any future bench hires. These are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nWhat to bring: Advanced students can bring projects to set stones into, but please note the metal must be at least 2mm thick and we do not allow brass to be used as a project or practice for beginners. The metal must be copper or sterling silver.\n\nStudents should bring either a craft magnifier or magnifying lenses/glasses. If you have your own flex shaft tool you plan to use at home for drilling and setting, please also bring this along so that your tutor can advise on the best way to use it. We have two drilling machines in the studio, and these must be shared between the students, so if you have a machine, do bring it.\n\nPractice bench hire after class $20 per person (till 4pm) must be booked in advance.\n\nWorkshop fee $195, Early bird $175 till 24 August.\n\n",

Sticking to the traditional one man band format, Chuck plays all the instruments simultaneously.\nCaptivating storytelling intertwines effortlessly with heart stopping harmonica. Multiple guitar styles are underpinned by his left and right feet frantically pounding the kick and hi hat. The listener is left simply wondering, \"How the hell does he do that\"?\nOriginally hailing from the UK, Li\u2019l Chuck has been stomping his music in NZ since 2003.\nLi'l Chuck has performed at many high profile events around New Zealand including opening for American legend Jimmy Buffet, Bluesman Jerron 'Blind Boy' Paxton and The Topp Twins, and festivals including Blues on Broadbeach, Gold Coast Australia, Dunedin and Wanaka Arts festivals, The Great Kiwi Beer festival, Canterbury folk festival and many more.\nUp to 2025, He has recorded 5 solo one man band records to great acclaim by international Blues publications.\nHis 2017 album Utility Blues hit No\u20196 on the official NZ albums chart & has twice been the feature artist on Jesse Mulligan's Radio New Zealand\u2019s Friday live.\nIn an age where we are rushing around at breakneck speed, where everything is instant, sugar coated, airbrushed and overly polished, Li\u2019l Chuck brings us down to earth with some organic, all natural, whole grain, naked goodness.\nDoors open 7pm for a 7.30pm start.",

And cracks are showing everywhere. So much that we thought was secure is shifting and changing. \nBut here in Aotearoa, we have an extraordinary pou\u2014Te Tiriti o Waitangi.\nCome along for a day of depth; exploring the amazing potential that the relational space of Te Tiriti has for us all. This one is for tangata Tiriti who are deeply committed to an ethic of restoration in Aotearoa and want to go beyond an intellectual understanding.\nJoin Rebecca and Mel from The P\u0101keh\u0101 Project for this one-day workshop exploring the mahi we as tangata Tiriti can do in the journey towards a Tiriti-led future. Using practices of Haumanu, a healing-centred approach to systems change, we\u2019ll be inquiring into our own roles in reweaving the relational fabric that Te Tiriti o Waitangi offered to all people in Aotearoa, but that did not happen at the time.\nWe invite you into a space for gently inquiring into your unique place in the system rewiring itself. How do we show up where M\u0101ori are calling us to be? We'll be exploring relationality and worldview; the nervous system as map for working with activation; systemic racism, the orthodox Western worldview\u2014its whakapapa and how it shows up in ourselves, our systems and society; and our roles in restorative systems change for a Tiriti-based future. It will be interactive, embodied, and nourishing.\nLet's create islands of coherence in this turbulent world.\nWe'll host you upstairs at Vogelmorn Bowling Club, in the beautiful hills of Brooklyn, Te Whanganui-a-Tara.

Over five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nDescription\nMany of us live sedentary lifestyles, sitting for up to eight hours or more a day hunched over our keyboard - all the while rarely taking a proper breath! Even if we wanted to take a deep enriching breath into the lower lobes of our lungs, we are limited due to our posture. Often due to the stresses and strains of a busy work and life balance, our unconscious brain can develop a pattern of holding, irregular and shadow breaths.\n\nDoes this sound like your experience?\n\nNot being able to breathe properly is the key cause of many chronic respiratory diseases (Nestor, 2020)\n\nCalligratherapy combines science journalist James Nestor's theory on proper breathing with the philosophy of ancient Chinese calligraphy to promote a state of optimal wellbeing.\n\nCalligratherapy has been developed specifically for those who have never practiced calligraphy before and who are interested in deriving the benefits without having to learn the language or all the characters. It integrates the simple and intuitive act of inhaling and exhaling into calligraphy practice with Eastern philosophy behind it.\n\nA range of different breathing exercises are embedded into each 90-minute session focusing on different calligraphy scripts. Over the five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing, while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts.\n\nAll materials included in course fee.\n\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:\n\nStart a new creative practice in Chinese soft brush calligraphy\nDevelop your own mindfulness strategy\nBetter manage everyday stress levels and access a calm, empowered and positive state of mind\nFind ways to explore eastern philosophy and develop deeper connections with your spiritual self.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

You can find her on social media @jemyoshioka most places (Instagram, BlueSky, TikTok, X)\nBuilding Sustainable Art Practices:\nIn 2025 it feels like it's challenging enough to survive as a person, let alone thrive as an artist. But art has the unique power to nourish us in ways nothing else can. In this workshop Jem will share some of the strategies, habits and tools she uses to fit in making graphic novels alongside full time employment without burning out. This session is practice-agnostic, and is designed to facilitate discussion about what a sustainable art practice can look like, how to build one, and how we can support each other when things are tough. No resources required but feel free to bring any notebooks or tools you use to manage your art or your time\n\nAfter that, we\u2019ll share some kai (potluck style), have a relaxed k\u014drero\nThe gathering will be held at a cozy private space in Wellington CBD, easily accessible by public transport.\nMessage us for the exact location: easternsoundcollective@gmail.com\nOr reach out on Instagram/Facebook: @easternsoundcollective\n",

Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

This workshop is currently the only hands-on sourdough workshop being offered in the Nelson region - I teach and demonstrate to you and then you get to mix and practice on your own dough as we go along.\nWhether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this event is perfect for anyone looking to master the art of making sourdough bread, learning from someone who has 10+ years of experience. Perhaps you've found all the Youtube tutorials and Instagram how-to's overwhelming and are keen to learn via an in-person class. Then this is for you! I've baked hundreds of loaves in the last year alone, sold at a market, and hosted a pop-up shop. However, my passion really lies with teaching others to bake their own sourdough in their own homes, for their own families (or small businesses - one day!).You will be taught, demonstrated to, and then you get to have a go yourself; whilst learning my tips and tricks along the way. Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes and troubleshoot guide\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 6-8pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. If for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though. In extenuating circumstances I may be able to hold your ticket for a future workshop; this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n*Payment to clear in bank account two days after ticket bought, after which time your ticket will be released on to someone else. Please pay immediately upon purchasing ticket.\n**All workshop info you need to know ahead of time is in the confirmation email. Please ensure you read this down to the bottom.\n***I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight! From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody",

Into a painting? Into a work of art? What are the building blocks you need?\n3. Inspiration from other creative sources: people, music, poetry, reading, random incidents. Ways to generate fresh ideas. How to clarify and focus in writing and art.\n4. Structure and boundaries. Dreaming big but being real. How do you find and stick to a creative process?

This is the first time the choir has performed in the Hutt Valley, and they hope to see some new faces in the audience as they bring this programme of  meaningful music from around the world to the stage.  \nMake Some Noise highlights issues of social justice, including indigenous, women\u2019s and civil rights and climate action. The programme is rich and varied, from Katerina Gimon\u2019s arrangement of AURORA\u2019s Apple Tree, a Norwegian pop song addressing the urgency of the global climate crisis, to Robert T. Gibson\u2019s arrangement of the gospel standard This Little Light of Mine. Oliassa by Malika Tirolien utilises an invented language to invoke a call from the ancestors, while Alex Vollant titles their piece Auass meaning \u201cchild\u201d in the Innu language to honour the generation of elders who survived the Residential Schools in Canada. The impact of sexual harassment and assault on women is highlighted in MILCK\u2019s I Can\u2019t Keep Quiet  and Lillia Ruocco and Emmanuelle Ader\u2019s Canzone r\u00f2 curtiell\u2019. Closer to home, Make Some Noise features a set of waiata in teo reo M\u0101ori to highlight the importance of indigenous voices in Aotearoa New Zealand, including Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s Whakarongo. This waiata-\u0101-ringa incorporates Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s beliefs and methodology on teaching te reo M\u0101ori.   \nLed by co-Musical Director Virginie Pacheco, Supertonic offers Make Some Noise as an invitation to concert-goers to consider the causes that are important to them. In connecting with audiences through the striking and impactful works of the composers featured in this programme - by turns harmonious, raucous, gut-wrenching, resolute - the choir hopes to inspire those listening to make some noise in their own lives. \nSupertonic was formed in 2014 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and strives to  push the boundaries of what choral music can be. The choir has performed concerts that cover the entire musical spectrum, from major classical works including Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Vivaldi's Gloria and Faure's Requiem to pop and rock spectaculars celebrating hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s from the likes of Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Elton John, Queen, and Celine Dion. The choir has performed alongside The Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, joined Brett McKenzie, the NZSO and The Muppets for the Jim Henson Retrospectacle,  shared the stage with Mama Kin Spender at Coastella, and performed in national civic commemorations, street festivals and at community events.",

    "description": "Jewellery-making in 8 weeks - Tuesday Eve Mixed Level, This class is mixed level, allowing beginners to work alongside advanced students. It starts on Tuesday, 14 October and runs for 8 weeks till Tuesday, 2 December, 5.30pm - 8pm.\nOur popular weeknight classes are the best way for beginners to get into jewellery making in a lively, warm and friendly environment.\n\nBeginners start with basic ring-making and stone-setting in copper or brass. Students will learn measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting and soldering. Then we move on to making a practice-ring set with a Cabochon stone (cabochon means it has a flat bottom and a smooth domed top) in a Bezel Setting. The stone-setting process teaches you many fundamental techniques in one project! As you work through your practice-ring and setting, you can move onto working in silver and produce another ring with a cabachon stone that you really love. This way you will learn the basics as you go on your practice-ring, before taking the next step in costly silver.\n\nLevel 2 students learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking as a way to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project so they have something to hone their skills that they are familiar with, as well as taking on a new skill. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet or a more complex bezel setting - for example a teardrop or soft square stone to take on bezels with corners!\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple projects they can work on self-directed in class: more chains or simple bezel settings are ideal - to help them strengthen their soldering skills - alongside a challenge project that might be a shelf setting (an adaptation of a bezel setting that can take faceted stones), a tube setting or a larger bezel setting for a box or brooch. Our tutors will work with you to discover your passions in the world of making, and to support your skills so you grow your understanding with each block you take. We recommend that students from level 3 and up take the occasional Technique class (for example - claw setting, enamelling, flush setting) and then bring those techniques into their projects in their block class to be supported in their practice and skill by their regular tutor.\n\nThis class fee does NOT include materials for any student.\nBeginners should expect to spend at least $60 on materials for their ring making project.\nAll metals and stones as well as quality findings and chains are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it thriftily in future projects!\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking.

    "description": "Karanga taonga, karanga tangata, karanga whenua |Reversing Cultural Amnesia: Activating M\u0101ori Practice in Museums, In 1947, M\u0101ori leader, politician, and scholar Apirana Ngata spoke to his scholarly peers at the Polynesian Society, announcing his greatest desire to revive M\u0101ori culture as a living force within communities, not be relegated to dead exhibits in museums (Ramsden 1948, 85).\nThis lecture acknowledges the concerns of visionary leaders and champions of cultural practice and their activation within museums. Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa. This annual public lecture series recognises the legacy of the late Dr Michael Volkerling who was one of the principal architects of New Zealand's cultural and creative sectors.",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015.

His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities.

    "description": "Return to Babylon Documentary Film Screening, The Assyrian Church of the East Youth Association (ACEYA) (Wellington Branch) is excited to present a special screening of 'Return to Babylon'\u2014the only one of its kind in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nThe documentary film takes you on an Assyrian family\u2019s journey as they visit the Assyrian Homeland after years of living in France.\nThis is a story of reconnecting with one\u2019s roots, identity, and people.\nFollowing the screening, we will have a pre-recorded Q&A session which includes the film's director, S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid, and S\u00e9miramis Ide and Agnes Ide Banipal\u2014two of the film's protagonists.\n Synopsis:\nS\u00e9miramis is French, an Eastern Christian, and Assyro-Chaldean. In the Val-d'Oise region, this community, originally from Turkey and Iraq, has lived since the 1980s in a rhythm marked by weddings, church services, and family meals.\nShaped by the exile of their parents and the persecution their community faced under the Turkish dictatorship and Daesh, S\u00e9miramis nurtures her roots in Assyrian civilization, originating from Mesopotamia. But the puzzle of her history no longer fits together as it once did.\nGradually, the elders are disappearing, taking with them an identity and culture that is 6,000 years old. How can this fracture be repaired, and this heritage preserved? Should they consider staying or returning to their ancestral homeland, now that peace has returned? Can one go back after decades of conflict? Can they rebuild and start anew to live in peace with themselves and others?\n\"Return to Babylon\" is a road movie from Sarcelles to Erbil, following S\u00e9miramis and her family on a journey that leads them to question their future in France and the fate of their community in the Middle East.\nA film by Marie Dault, S\u00e9miramis Ide, and S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nDirected by S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nScreen time: 52-minutes; French and Assyrian with subtitles\nLink to the English-subtitled trailer: https://www.instagram.com/p/DDzsYJzt_B9/\nThe screening event will be held at the Cockburn Street Chapel, 1 Cockburn Street, Kilbirnie, Wellington from 5-7pm.\n\nEntrance is free, but please register to confirm your attendance.\n\nWe welcome koha (donations) which will go towards supporting the ACEYA Wellington Branch's youth-focused activities and events.",

    "description": "A Change Is Coming walk tour (Wellington Heritage Festival), A Change Is Coming walk tour (Wellington Heritage Festival)\n1pm, SUNDAY 19th OCTOBER 2025\n\n2025 marks the 40th anniversary of the introduction in 1985, of the Homosexual Law Reform bill. The bill set out to decriminalise homosexual activity between consenting adults and make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t the first attempt at homosexual law reform. Join us on this special 90-minute free walk tour to celebrate the people and movements that fought for a brighter future for rainbow communities.\n\nOur journey begins at the location of the first public meeting in New Zealand, advocating for homosexual law reform in 1967. This was two years before the Stonewall uprising in the U.S. which went on to ignite Gay Liberation around the world.\n\nThe tour ends at Parliament, where we honour the Members of Parliament who have championed equality over the last five decades.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll reflect on some of the difficult realities rainbow communities have faced, from the injustices of the legal system, to the stances of the medical profession, churches and the military. As the late activist Ralph Knowles recalls, \u201cAs far as medicine was concerned, it was sick. As far as the law was concerned, it was a crime. As far as the church was concerned, it was a sin.\u201d\n\nThough at times the stories are challenging, this walk tour is ultimately uplifting, as we pay tribute to our amazing rainbow kaumatua and allies who led the way.\n\nCOST: Free, but please register so we can manage the number of walkers: https://walktoursnz.wordpress.com/book/\n\nDATE/TIME: 1pm, Sunday 19th October 2025\n\nSTARTS: meet at the rugby sculpture, Jack Ilott Green, corner of Harris Street & Jervois Quay (just by Civic Square)\n\nENDS: Parliament grounds\n\nDURATION: 1 hour 30mins\n\nACCESSIBILITY: the tour is on flat public footpaths, with a light incline as we enter Parliament grounds. Tours are limited to approximately 20 walkers.\n\nThis tour is part of the amazing Wellington Heritage Festival - https://wellingtonheritagefestival.co.nz\n\n",

Max 5 people.\nCome and have a go at wet-plate collodion photography, using authentic materials to produce your own heirloom image as were made 170 years ago. This almost lost art produces one-of-a-kind images on tin or glass plates, which you create and have an image you\u2019ve crafted to take away.\n\nBrian Scadden will be your instructor for this workshop. Brain has been passionate about photography for over 40 years, beginning his career at the National Film Unit in the 1970s before joining Park Road Post Production as Head of Laboratory, Head of Picture, and Restoration Manager. His work in film sparked an interest in early photographic techniques, prompting him to master wet-plate collodion photography. In 2006, he was invited to assist leading wet-plate experts in the USA and has since taught many New Zealanders this challenging process. Jane, who attended Brian\u2019s workshop in 2014, later married him in 2019 and completed a photographic project in Carterton in 2016.\nAlthough Brian retired in 2015, he returned for short-term assignments at Park Road Post and part-time work at Archive NZ, supporting film archiving until mid-2023. Both Brian and Jane continue to shoot with 35mm and 120mm film using vintage cameras from their collection.\n\nNOTE: Link for booking tickets coming soon.\n\nEmail:\nwww.greytownarttown.com\n\n",

We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Driftwood from nearby south coast beaches is often abundant, feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page.

    "description": "September Full Moon Drumming, Please remember this is a ZERO WASTE and *NO ALCOHOL* community gathering.\nKia ora!\nFull Moon Drumming Wellington is a registered public event with the Wellington City Council. We are a group of humans from all walks of life who gather under the full moon each month to connect through drumming and dance around the fire. This gathering is participatory, that means if you made it to the circle you are part of the circle. As in Africa, there is no audience! Everyone is invited to participate as part of the \u2018chorus\u2019 (singing/clapping), dancing, or drumming.\nThe event is weather permitting, we check the forecast a few days prior and aim to make a decision the day before the event, although this is not possible and sometimes we make the decision on the day. All updates are posted on the event page.\nThis gathering is entirely run by volunteers, if you'd like to contribute in any way please get in touch.\nThere are a few things that we need help with:\n- FIREWOOD: Please bring dry firewood as a koha, no wood no fire! Please NOTE we DO NOT burn pallets (due to nails) or treated timber. Driftwood from nearby south coast beaches is often abundant, feel free to post or reach out if you have a vehicle and are keen to help gather firewood on the day of the event.\n- BEAUTIFYING THE CIRCLE SPACE: Anyone has fairy lights, oil burners, or is keen to make some signs?\nNOTE: We hold a fire permit for this event. For safety reasons we don't allow participants to feed the fire, and while is generally okay to roast some marshmallows early in the evening we don't allow the use the fire for cooking or heating food.\nThis is an **ALCOHOL FREE EVENT**, please help us uphold this kaupapa and remind those who are unaware and might be new to the event. As hosts we are responsible for your safety and we take that responsibility seriously, especially given that the event is authorised through both fire and event permits. Large, public, all ages gatherings require administration and logistics so please respect this and the guidelines provided.\nPrincess Bay is within Taputeranga Marine Reserve (https://octopus.org.nz/taputeranga-marine-reserve), we are welcomed to gather each month in this special place so let\u2019s all make sure there is NO RUBBISH LEFT BEHIND and that we take care of the space. Dogs are NOT ALLOWED at the gathering - there are Korora (Blue Pinguins) nesting under the rocks nearby and we've had issues with dogs in the past.\nChildren are welcome at the fire, though, especially after dark, please make sure that all children have adult supervision, that the supervisors are aware of the children they are looking after, and that the children are aware of who is looking after them.\nFeel free to bring:\n- Your friends.\n- Drums or any percussive instrument.\n- Warm clothing; jackets and wool blankets are good.\n- Something to seat on (otherwise sand is often wet)\n- Drinking water.\n- Food, tea to share.\n- Your lovely selves.\n- Fire spinning kit and fuel.\nFIRE SPINNERS: Please take all precautionary safety measures and make sure to set up fire-spinning downwind from the fire circle.\nPARKING: There's a parking lot a few hundred meters from the fire circle where there's also public toilets. Please also be aware of our neighbors driveway opposite the stairway and do not park directly in front of it.\nCARPOOLING: If you don't have a way to get to Princess Bay, or if you have spare seats in your car, feel free to post it on the event page. The less cars driving the better.\nFeel free to share the event page and send an event invite to whomever you feel would be interested, not everyone sees the notifications and advertising ",

On both floors you\u2019ll find a series of balistraria, tightly angled gun slots through which members of the militia would defend their posts.\n\nKeep an eye out, too, for an exposed panel where you can see the fine gravel that was packed between the exterior weatherboards and inch-thick interior boards to absorb the impact of answering gunfire. Don\u2019t be fooled by the windows \u2013 they were added later. Originally, the loop holes you\u2019ll spy on the walls were the only way to see out.\n\nInside the Blockhouse, there\u2019s an exhibition from Whirinaki Whare Taonga, telling the early story of Upper Hutt and its Blockhouse.\n\nWe will have some knowledgeable people available to share stories, answer questions and some light refreshments. Drop in between 11-1pm and stay as long as you like!\n\n\nBooking is REQUIRED.\nCost: $10 - $15\nBooking information here: https://wellingtonheritagefestival.co.nz/event/visit-the-upper-hutt-blockhouse/\n\n\nHealth & Safety:\nPlease note as an historic building the Upper Hutt Blockhouse is not suitable for those with accessibility needs.\n\n",

Return could therefore either be 1:30 or 2:30 with the latest return to Titahi Bay being 3pm.\n\nWe've made this event later than the normal SKISL so that it's easier for folks to drive down from Palmerston North, and also because it is a lunch event.\n\nThe lawn on Mana is really nice, sheltered and pleasant and there are also good walks. Mana is of course a sanctuary so you must check your boats for any wildlife especially ants that may have gotten in past the hatches.

    "description": "Voices from the Moana: Amplifying Pacific stories of healing and resilience, Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Paci\ufb01c style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and e\ufb00ective insights. Tai refers to ocean waters, which represent your opportunity to rise through the ebb and \ufb02ow of this learning journey. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from di\ufb00erent communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from Voices from the Moana?\nIn Voices from the Moana, you will explore and share rich narratives of healing and resilience from different Pacific nations and perspectives. The Pacific ocean is a diverse place and we have our own unique stories of healing through traditional practices, beliefs and methods. This Talanoa Tai learning experience invites reflection on your own understanding of different healing modalities from the Pacific and the impact it has on your worldview. It will equip you to advocate for social justice through Pacific voices. You'll gain practical tolls and insights that you can apply directly to your work.\nThis is a 3 hour in-person learning experience.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\n Facilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives.

The inclusion of considerable footage from Jacinda's partner Clarke Gayford provides a deeply personal view of life as the Prime Minister in very challenging times.\n(Los Angeles Times review) 'Prime Minister' is not interested in wrangling, dealing and lawmaking, or even the nuts and bolts or her progressive views. ..

This almost lost art produces one-of-a-kind images on tin or glass plates, which you create and have an image you\u2019ve crafted to take away.\n\nBrian Scadden will be your instructor for this workshop. Brain has been passionate about photography for over 40 years, beginning his career at the National Film Unit in the 1970s before joining Park Road Post Production as Head of Laboratory, Head of Picture, and Restoration Manager. His work in film sparked an interest in early photographic techniques, prompting him to master wet-plate collodion photography. In 2006, he was invited to assist leading wet-plate experts in the USA and has since taught many New Zealanders this challenging process. Jane, who attended Brian\u2019s workshop in 2014, later married him in 2019 and completed a photographic project in Carterton in 2016.\nAlthough Brian retired in 2015, he returned for short-term assignments at Park Road Post and part-time work at Archive NZ, supporting film archiving until mid-2023.

This years' experience comes in the form of the Roman tragedy Octavia\u2014the only extant Roman play set in the eternal city of Rome.\n\nOften attributed to Seneca, but likely in truth penned by an unknown playwright we know as Pseudo-Seneca under the Flavian dynasty, Octavia is a hard tragedy depicting the divorce and hardships of the titular Octavia\u2014the first wife of Emperor Nero.\n\nFollow our tragic heroine as she bears the weight of her Julio-Claudian family name and all the expectations that are thrust upon her with it. Bear witness the cruelty of Emperor Nero and his crimes driven by an unbridled and unabated passion.

From intimate improvisations and poignant melodies to soaring strings, the music moves through moments of reverence, reflection, and quiet triumph.

    "description": "Messengers, \u2018Animals first entered the imagination as messengers and promises,\u2019 John Berger.\nMessengers explores the enduring gaze shared between humans and other animals. The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

    "description": "Women's Krav Maga Self Defence Intro Night, We believe every woman should feel strong, fearless and confident for life. Krav Maga has proven to be highly empowering for women all around the world. We offer this course to women to learn to deal with women-related challenges, encouraging every woman to overcome anxiety or fear, with confidence, skills and strength.\nKrav Maga is a system that enables a smaller person to effectively disable a larger opponent. We will teach you how to utilise adrenalin and function under stress. It was created to be adaptable and easy to learn, regardless of your size. This makes Krav Maga perhaps the most suitable self-defence training for women today. Apart from the physical training, we will also train you to develop mental resilience, street tactics, confidence, positive self image, and empower you for life.\nIn an ideal world, women would not need to learn to protect themselves. However, until some deeply ingrained societal problems are resolved, it is smart and necessary to have some skills to be able to look after yourself and loved ones with. In the meantime, we encourage every women to approach this training with personal development, personal growth, enjoyment and empowerment being the motivating purpose.\nWe understand women often prefer to train in a women's class. This is our Women's (13+) class called ROAR.\nThese classes are about empowering you for life. Beginning in 2018, this program was created to provide a safe, holistic and supportive class where women can experience empowerment through our training. You will learn to find your voice, your confidence, your inner strength and resolve, while learning physical skills such as how to escape and overpower an assailant, counter grabs, abduction attempts, chokes, hair grabs, pushing and shoving, being hit, being pinned to the ground and sexual assault attempts. We will help you unleash your protective feminine fighting spirit\nThe Intro Night is the ideal time for women interested in the Women's Class to try a class first, see how we train, who we are, and gain some valuable basic skills, before deciding to join the full course. (Note: School Term 4, 2025 is 11 weeks long). No cost to attend the Intro Night.\nPlease email contact@tacticalsurvival.co.nz to enquire or book your spot.\nMore Info: www.tacticalsurvival.co.nz/womens\nAfter Intro, classes run every Wednesday night 7:00pm - 8:00pm (Thistle Hall Cuba St) ",

When triggered, these unconscious \u201cprograms\u201d hijack our reactions, leaving us feeling stuck even when we want to move forward. In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore how trauma influences the nervous system and why awareness alone isn\u2019t enough to create lasting change.\nIn this 75 minute workshop, you\u2019ll discover how trauma impacts the nervous system and learn FasterEFT tools to release triggers, reframe old memories, and reset your stress response. You\u2019ll walk away with simple, science-backed practices you can use every day to build resilience and emotional freedom.\n\u201cThis is an interactive workshop where you\u2019ll connect with others. It\u2019s a powerful reminder that, beneath the surface, we generally share the same challenges and struggles\u2014and that healing becomes easier when we explore them together.\u201d\nMeet your host, Krishnaloka\nIntroducing Krishnaloka, who is driven to help others overcome their issues within their mind and pyschology.

Located on the eastern side of Antananarivo, the capital, the orphanage was founded by the incredible Madame Hary in 2012. What started as a humble project from her own home has grown into a haven for 54 children, some of whom were rescued from areas where twins are sadly believed to be cursed.\nDespite the challenges, the orphanage continues to thrive, relying entirely on the kindness of visitors. They grow their own rice, maintain a small chicken farm, and have a vegetable garden to sustain themselves. But their greatest need is for ongoing support and resources to continue providing for these beautiful children.\nBy attending our concert, you\u2019ll be helping make a direct impact on the lives of these children.

    "description": "Bar Crossing Seminar - Manawat\u016b (Foxton bar), Crossing A Bar? We Can Help\nBar crossings can be one of the trickiest, and riskiest parts of boating in Aotearoa. They change fast, they don\u2019t always play nice, and they\u2019ve caught out even the most experienced skippers. Each year, we see serious incidents and tragedies happening on our bars, so it\u2019s super important to know your stuff before you head out.\nThat\u2019s where we come in. Join us at Manawatu Marine Boating Club for a free and relaxed seminar. You\u2019ll hear straight from local Coastguard skippers and boating legends who\u2019ll share their real-world tips, local knowledge, and a few stories from the water.\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover (and chat about):\n\nUnderstanding the local features of your bar\nReading and interpreting the conditions when planning a trip\nGetting your boat and your crew bar crossing ready\nHow to handle your boat while crossing\nHow to do a bar crossing report (and why it\u2019s worth it)\nWhat to do if things go pear-shaped\nIt\u2019s interactive \u2013 so bring your questions, share your own experiences, and have a yarn with others in the boating community.\nBring your mates too \u2013 whether they\u2019re brand new to boating or have been around since the days of paper charts and handheld compasses, there\u2019s something in here that could save a trip\u2026 or a life.\n Why it matters:\nIn 2024, 23% of craft-related drownings happened during bar crossings.\n5 lives were lost due to capsizing while crossing a bar.\nOlder blokes are still the most at-risk \u2013 but everyone can make safer choices with the right knowledge (and a lifejacket on).",

Gaining international attention after opening for one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most coveted DJs Fred again.. and remixing his song \u2018places to be\u2019 which now has over 2.6M listens on Spotify alone, MESSIE is quickly becoming one of the most exciting new names to watch in New Zealand.\nAudiences will be able to enjoy MESSIE\u2019s high-energy, electrifying set for literally the entire night - with these two shows running until the early hours of the morning.

MESSIE\u2019s sets are guaranteed to be bootleg heavy with something for everyone as she draws from her own music taste of rap and grime, to early 2000\u2019s singalongs, girl-boss anthems and queer music culture in the form of edits you\u2019d never expect.\nAlongside her headline tour around Aotearoa in mid 2024, MESSIE has now brought her fresh, high-energy club music internationally to Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, R&V, Beyond The Valley, Wildlands, Love Saves The Day, Gemfest & Outro Festival.

They are shown how to use a jeweller\u2019s saw to cut their metal to the correct length, how to form it up and how to solder.\n\nThen they learn how to shape their rings and finish them up into a wearable piece of jewellery, all in the first class!\n\nIn the first session they are also shown how to texture metals, cut and layer shapes, melt balls of silver and other techniques to create decorative elements.\n\nStudents can spend their evening thinking about and planning their design in silver for the next day. We encourage them to carefully plan this project and think about how they might make their piece before they begin, including creating drawings and notes. (We always say drawings don\u2019t need to be \u201cgood\u201d, they just need to make sense to the student and their tutor!). This project can be another ring, or earrings or pendants. We have a great selection of example pieces in the workshop so they can see what\u2019s achievable in the 3-hour time frame. Sometimes students can make more than one silver piece if they have enough time.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are copper and brass for practising on, up to 8 grams of sterling silver and all consumables such as sandpaper, solder and chemicals. Extra metals and chains are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nKids 12 and up are welcome in this class, any person under 16 years old must be accompanied by an enrolled caregiver.",

    "description": "Techno Taster, Techno Taster\nThis year for the first of our annual pre-parties we\u2019ve gone around the country to gather a lineup of creators working at the intersections of techno, delving into influences from bass, breaks, psychedelia, club music and beyond, all underpinned by elements of dance music's most enduring genre.\n\nWe believe each one of these acts is currently pushing the needle forward for underground club culture in Aotearoa, and are thrilled to host them all together at Valhalla to push their vision across the almighty Third Eye Hi-Fi soundsystem.\n\n\nELI H\u00d8FF \u2014 Abyssal Soundworks / PHTM\n\nProducer and DJ, Eli is undoubtedly at the forefront of Aotearoa\u2019s underground dance scene.\nThose who have kept their ears tuned to the innovative underground have no doubt stumbled upon the tribalistic, psychedelic, and focused sounds emanating from the mind of Auckland-based producer Eli H\u00f8ff. With a string of releases on Berlin-based PHTM, T\u0101maki Makaurau-based Gypnotica, and an impressive catalog of self-releases, he consistently showcases his singular and original interpretation of dance music.\n\nInstagram.com/e.li\nelihoff.bandcamp.com\nabyssalsoundworks.bandcamp.com\n\n\nHUNTER \u2014 Hang the Saints / Haven\n\nRaised in Kaik\u014dura, Aotearoa, Hunter's dark and atmospheric sound often contrasts the beautiful environment she grew up in. Her direct approach to techno draws influence from heavy percussion, bold rhythm and industrial soundscapes. After spending two years finding inspiration in clubs overseas, she has returned to \u014ctautahi with a refined style that\u2019s ready to make people dance. As the co-founder of \u201cHang The Saints\u201d and resident of \u201cHaven\u201d, Hunter is all about creating safe, inclusive spaces for people to connect through the music she loves.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sspoonsnake/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hunter-mccrory-334790608\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/bC3qeA6pUxBoMo7P9\n\n\nLUDUS & RIZZO \u2014 Tonic Collective\n\nTonic Collective is the recent endeavour of Ludus and Rizzo, inspired by the people, places and spaces of their experience touring China with BIRDPARTY and Vera Ellen. Both acts are individually known for their versatile and innovative sound, bringing a wide range of influences and inspirations to the dancefloor. In the short time since establishing the collective, they\u2019ve already hosted Kaishandao and Bone Chapel, established a space, and debuted a monthly radio show on Mouthfull that explores sound from across the genre spectrum, both in the club and out.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ludus.etc/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alicerizzoofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tonic.collective/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/l-s-rizzo/416life-support-cl1n1c-chengdu\nhttps://soundcloud.com/racquetclub-info/mix-series-016-ludus\n\n\nSHLI \u2014 Echo Train Records / Warehouse Rave / Holding Hands\n\nShli is the alias of \u014ctautahi-via-P\u014dneke DJ and Producer Tim Ward. Steadily releasing works over recent years through local labels like Echo Train and the Big Fresh Collective, he is carving out a sound of his own.\n\nStitching together infectious rhythms layered over low-end pressure, Shli\u2019s sets draw influence from across the hardcore continuum and beyond. Creating dancefloor moments from trippy rhythmic states to unleashing sheer bass weight.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/____shli/\nhttps://echotrainer.bandcamp.com/album/ech009-bracing-set-pace-u-dont\nhttps://soundcloud.com/1shli\n\n",

Over half of the country has been liberated by opposition armed groups, but the regime hangs on, using air strikes, forced conscription and brutality to control the main cities and areas of economic value. Amongst the opposition is the punk movement that has led protests, organised Food not Bombs groups, food gardens, social centres and other projects, both inside and outside the country, all run on the smell of an oily rag.

    "description": "Make Some Noise - choral music that matters, After a successful performance of Mozart\u2019s classic Requiem in D Minor in May, Supertonic is back with a programme of contemporary choral music that matters. \nOn the evening of Saturday 8 November, Supertonic will present Make Some Noise at the Lower Hutt Town Hall. This is the first time the choir has performed in the Hutt Valley, and they hope to see some new faces in the audience as they bring this programme of  meaningful music from around the world to the stage.  \nMake Some Noise highlights issues of social justice, including indigenous, women\u2019s and civil rights and climate action. The programme is rich and varied, from Katerina Gimon\u2019s arrangement of AURORA\u2019s Apple Tree, a Norwegian pop song addressing the urgency of the global climate crisis, to Robert T. Gibson\u2019s arrangement of the gospel standard This Little Light of Mine. Oliassa by Malika Tirolien utilises an invented language to invoke a call from the ancestors, while Alex Vollant titles their piece Auass meaning \u201cchild\u201d in the Innu language to honour the generation of elders who survived the Residential Schools in Canada. The impact of sexual harassment and assault on women is highlighted in MILCK\u2019s I Can\u2019t Keep Quiet  and Lillia Ruocco and Emmanuelle Ader\u2019s Canzone r\u00f2 curtiell\u2019. Closer to home, Make Some Noise features a set of waiata in teo reo M\u0101ori to highlight the importance of indigenous voices in Aotearoa New Zealand, including Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s Whakarongo. This waiata-\u0101-ringa incorporates Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s beliefs and methodology on teaching te reo M\u0101ori.   \nLed by co-Musical Director Virginie Pacheco, Supertonic offers Make Some Noise as an invitation to concert-goers to consider the causes that are important to them. In connecting with audiences through the striking and impactful works of the composers featured in this programme - by turns harmonious, raucous, gut-wrenching, resolute - the choir hopes to inspire those listening to make some noise in their own lives. \nSupertonic was formed in 2014 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and strives to  push the boundaries of what choral music can be. The choir has performed concerts that cover the entire musical spectrum, from major classical works including Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Vivaldi's Gloria and Faure's Requiem to pop and rock spectaculars celebrating hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s from the likes of Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Elton John, Queen, and Celine Dion. The choir has performed alongside The Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, joined Brett McKenzie, the NZSO and The Muppets for the Jim Henson Retrospectacle,  shared the stage with Mama Kin Spender at Coastella, and performed in national civic commemorations, street festivals and at community events.",

    "description": "NZIFF: Deaf, A woman navigates the experience of motherhood as a deaf person in a hearing world in Eva Libertad\u2019s crowd-pleasing, feel-good drama which collected the Panaroma Audience Award at Berlin this year.\n\nBased on the award-winning short of the same name, Spanish filmmaker Eva Libertad\u2019s debut follows couple \u00c1ngela and H\u00e9ctor as they make the transition into parenthood. \u00c1ngela is deaf. H\u00e9ctor is not. When she tells them she\u2019s pregnant, her own parents can\u2019t hide their shock \u2013 loving but concerned that their daughter will be unable to tackle the task of motherhood. Will the baby be born deaf? Uncertainty abounds as the due date draws closer, and it\u2019s not just \u00c1ngela\u2019s parents who are beginning to have doubts.\n\nThe foundations for the film\u2019s narrative derive from the personal experiences of first-time actor Miriam Garlo, Libertad\u2019s own sister, as she began to contemplate motherhood as a deaf woman. When surrounded by her other deaf friends, \u00c1ngela is comfortable, alive, vibrant within a community that supports her. Around the local mums in the park, or her husband\u2019s friends, isolation sets in with a painful immediacy that anyone who has ever struggled to understand the language in a foreign country will know all too well. A poignant story bound by the chemistry of its leads, deafness is woven into the film as a lived experience, not a defining label. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

Distance and death became everyday realities for Kiwis at home \u2013 and caused griefs that were at times taboo and suppressed.\n\nDame Gaylene Preston frames seven women, including her own mother, against a black background that creates a stage for their candid, unadorned and surprisingly intimate wartime recollections, as they look back from the 90s in interviews conducted by oral historian Judith Fyfe. The acclaimed documentary, which combines these shared testimonies with personal photographs and newsreel clips, conveys the immense pressure to conform to the value of stoic sacrifice for the cause under the scrutinising eye of neighbours, and reveals lesser-seen layers of resilience.\n\nMarriages in the first flush of romance were cut short, pregnancies were navigated alone, conscientious objectors were met with ostracisation and American servicemen scorned, in a nation united around support of their boys in combat overseas \u2013 a state of affairs in which women were often granted little voice, as they took on more labour, and absorbed life-changing losses. \u2014 Carmen Gray",

    "description": "NZIFF: Sentimental Value, This film may touch on the familiar theme of how artists draw from their own lives, but Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgard bring incredible tenderness to a story that is ultimately about what children and parents never say to one another \u2014 and whether those lifelong silences can ever be broken.\nCollaborating again with frequent co-writer Eskil Vogt (now also a successful director), Trier fashions a nuanced look at both a troubled family and a dysfunctional film industry. (Gustav\u2019s comeback project will be distributed through Netflix, and the divisive streamer is the target of a couple of the screenplay\u2019s better barbs.) Much of Sentimental Value takes place in the Borg family\u2019s home, and an efficient flashback, framed as an essay Nora wrote as a girl, explains how they have lived in the house for generations\u2026 That slightly fading family home becomes an apt metaphor for the weathered bond Nora, Agnes and Gustav share, although Reinsve\u2019s fragile performance articulates the festering resentment she feels toward her absent father.\nTrier\u2019s third picture to screen at Cannes, after 2021\u2019s The Worst Person In The World\u2019s breakout lead Reinsve won Best Actress, the reunion of director and star will entice arthouse crowds\u2026 and those seeking a smart, thoughtful tearjerker should be pleased with this sentimental but farfrom-mawkish film.\u201d \u2014 Tom Grierson, Screen Daily",

The unexpected suicide of her partner has left her a hollowed-out shell \u2013 that is, until Jack (Dacre Montgomery), Elizabeth\u2019s long-absent son, arrives at the funeral, apparently invited by Jill herself, though she does not remember doing so.\n\nThe circumstances of Jack\u2019s long absence are unclear \u2013 all that is known is that Jack was given up for adoption at a very young age. Staying the night at Jill and Elizabeth\u2019s oppressive, concrete-clad mountain abode, it quickly becomes clear that the spirit of Elizabeth has not yet departed \u2013 instead, she has gained the ability to possess both wife and son and is utilising this ability to linger and address the needs of either relationship. What initially seems to be a gift from beyond, however, begins to sour when long-hidden secrets of the past begin to emerge, and lines between the two begin to be crossed.\n\nThe sophomore feature of Samuel Van Grinsven, Went Up the Hill is a wintry, gothic affair, and a showcase for the untapped talents of Montgomery, who most will recognise as the golden-haired, ill-fated muscle mutt Billy from Stranger Things. Essentially a two-hander (with occasional, welcome interjection from Kiwi legend Sarah Peirse as Jack\u2019s frosty, mystery-shrouded aunt), Van Grinsven tracks the trajectory of these two adrift people and the spirit between them \u2013 from unexpected refuge, to joy, to dread \u2013 with a purposeful, drip-fed escalation of tension. Questions of control, abuse and the lingering weight of past scars take hold, all while the usually pleasantly scenic Christchurch landscape is transformed into a suffocatingly claustrophobic ice prison. Van Grinsven\u2019s muscular direction bears none of the flashy excesses of an emerging filmmaker \u2013 his vision emerges, stately, imposing and fully-formed. \u2014 Tom Augustine",

Intertwined with these flashback sequences are scenes from present day Catalonia and Burgos where Ariadna, the granddaughter of one of Antonio's pupils, seeks to locate ancestral remains at the mass graves of La Pedraja.\n\nAntonio\u2019s leftist leanings and critiques of the new Francoist government anger the more conservative townsfolk, particularly the town mayor. This is despite his daughter being one of the pupils benefiting most from the free expression encouraged by Antonio\u2019s Freinet method teachings. Meanwhile, Ariadna teeters between hope and despair in her search for closure \u2013 a human vessel embodying the plight of a nation still wrestling with the consequences of a brutal conflict.\n\nThe closing credits remark that the remains of 12,000 people have been exhumed across the country. Like Ariadna, the film attempts to seek answers from the horrors of a war that took place almost a century ago \u2013 one driven by political sentiments that feel unsettlingly familiar as some of today\u2019s most powerful nations shift towards fascism. \u2014 Matt Bloomfield",

Inseparable in childhood, the brothers drifted apart as adults, brother Rocky (also O\u2019Brien) living out and proud in Portland while Roman lived a (decidedly hetero) tradie life in hometown Idaho.

In the Val-d'Oise region, this community, originally from Turkey and Iraq, has lived since the 1980s in a rhythm marked by weddings, church services, and family meals.\nShaped by the exile of their parents and the persecution their community faced under the Turkish dictatorship and Daesh, S\u00e9miramis nurtures her roots in Assyrian civilization, originating from Mesopotamia. But the puzzle of her history no longer fits together as it once did.\nGradually, the elders are disappearing, taking with them an identity and culture that is 6,000 years old. How can this fracture be repaired, and this heritage preserved? Should they consider staying or returning to their ancestral homeland, now that peace has returned? Can one go back after decades of conflict? Can they rebuild and start anew to live in peace with themselves and others?\n\"Return to Babylon\" is a road movie from Sarcelles to Erbil, following S\u00e9miramis and her family on a journey that leads them to question their future in France and the fate of their community in the Middle East.\nA film by Marie Dault, S\u00e9miramis Ide, and S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nDirected by S\u00e9bastien Daycard-Heid\nScreen time: 52-minutes; French and Assyrian with subtitles\nLink to the English-subtitled trailer: https://www.instagram.com/p/DDzsYJzt_B9/\nThe screening event will be held at the Cockburn Street Chapel, 1 Cockburn Street, Kilbirnie, Wellington from 5-7pm.\n\nEntrance is free, but please register to confirm your attendance.\n\nWe welcome koha (donations) which will go towards supporting the ACEYA Wellington Branch's youth-focused activities and events.",

She had just turned 37. Two frenetic months later, she was Prime Minister. Just before the final vote was in, she discovered she was pregnant. She would become only the second head of state in history to give birth while in office.\nArdern quickly became one of the most recognisable leaders in the world. She drew global attention from people craving a sensitive and compassionate approach to the critical issues of our time. In private, she struggled with being a mother and proving herself to a public skeptical of women\u2019s leadership. A series of crises - the Christchurch massacre, pandemic lockdowns, and disinformation-fueled protests outside Parliament - would test that leadership and the feminine touch she brought to it. She resigned from office in January 2023, shocking her supporters and critics alike.\nGoing behind the scenes of her administration and her private life, Prime Minister follows Jacinda for seven years as she is catapulted to the top of New Zealand politics, becomes a feminist political icon, resigns suddenly from office and continues to champion the fight against isolationism, fear, and the distortion of truth. Intimate home footage shot by her husband and audio interviews that Jacinda did while in office give us unparalleled access.

However, if you\u2019re currently in recovery, this can be extremely healing, and help you discover the deeper patterns that gave rise to this addiction.

    "description": "Dragons Is My Uso, Chef Jessica Tang and legendary home chefs Litia Lefaoseu and Iutita Mallon are drawing on the century long fusion of Chinese and Samoan cuisine and the way food expresses love, ai, and alofa. In the late 1800s, small numbers of Chinese settled in Samoa and became part of a growing multicultural community. There they influenced local customs, made an enduring contribution to Samoan cuisine introducing contemporary favourites such as sapasui (chop suey), keke pua\u2018a (pork buns) and of course laisa (rice). \r\n\r\nDragons celebrate this cultural and culinary fusion by showcasing these favourites and presenting new dishes highlighting the shared love of culinary staples such as taro and noodles, rice, fish, and pork, the magnificent spectrum of Chinese herbs, spices and flavours. Through cooking and sharing food together the chefs honour their culinary heritage, strengthen our connections to one another and celebrate the big and little moments in life. This is a shared-style meal, served banquet style on lazy Susan turntables. \r\nDragons is My Uso was one of the sell-out hits of the 2024 festival - don't miss out!\r\n\r\nDiscounted tables for 10 available for $1000, so get the whole aiga together!",

You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

Gaining international attention after opening for one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most coveted DJs Fred again.. and remixing his song \u2018places to be\u2019 which now has over 2.6M listens on Spotify alone, MESSIE is quickly becoming one of the most exciting new names to watch in New Zealand.\nAudiences will be able to enjoy MESSIE\u2019s high-energy, electrifying set for literally the entire night - with these two shows running until the early hours of the morning. Saturday, September 13th will see her take over Auckland\u2019s Studio the Venue, before heading to Wellington\u2019s San Fran the following Saturday, September 20th.\nTickets for MESSIE\u2019s All Night Long tour in Auckland and Wellington will be available to purchase by the General Public on Friday 4th July at 12:00pm.\nMy Live Nation members will also be able to secure tickets during the presale which commences Wednesday 2nd July from 11:00am until Friday 4th July at 11:00am. Fans can register for access at livenation.co.nz.\nMESSIE is taking Aotearoa\u2019s electronic dance music scene to filthy new levels. As a former drummer, her passion for drumming was the pipeline for her falling in love with genres like Garage, Breakbeat, and Jungle.

The book will be launched by Charlotte MacDonald.\n\nTuesday 7 October, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nAll welcome!\n\n'Existing views of Featherston are fragmentary, negative and not very satisfactory. He was the \u201clittle Doctor\u201d, a single-minded despot wielding tyrannical power and casting an oppressive shadow. As I began to understand more of his life, I realised that there was little appreciation of a man who had contributed so much.\u2019 \u2014John E.Martin\n\nIsaac Featherston was at the heart of some of the most significant developments in New Zealand from the 1840s colonisation by the New Zealand Company to the abolition of the provinces in 1876. A doctor, newspaper editor and politician, he advocated for the provinces against the domination of central government, while also being primarily responsible for the relocation of the capital from Auckland to Wellington in 1865.\n\nKnown amongst M\u0101ori as \u2018Petatone\u2019 and with a reputation for directness and honesty, he was at the very centre of P\u0101keh\u0101\u2013M\u0101ori relations, and in his 1857 official portrait is depicted alongside leading rangatira Te Puni and Wi Tako.\n\nAbout the author: Dr. John E. Martin has researched and written about New Zealand history since the 1980s, teaching in universities and employed as a historian in the public sector. He was parliamentary historian in the 2000s and 2010s. His publications include rural and labour history, the history of science and engineering, and social and political history. His books include The Forgotten Worker (1990), People, Politics and Power Stations (1991 and 1998), Holding the Balance (1996), The House: New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives, 1854\u20132004 (2004), Parliament\u2019s Library (2008), Honouring the Contract (2010), Illuminating Our World (2017), A Colonist\u2019s Gaze (2018) and most recently Empire City: Wellington Becomes the Capital of New Zealand (2022).",

The first major study of Russia and Southeast Asia since the end of the Cold War, it traces the dramatic shifts in Moscow\u2019s relations with the region since President Vladimir Putin took power in 2000. Dr Storey assesses the legacy of the Soviet Union, charts the evolution of Putin\u2019s foreign policy and identifies the drivers behind the Kremlin\u2019s \u2018Turn to the East\u2019 or Asia pivot. His book also examines Russia\u2019s dialogue partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the development of Moscow\u2019s political, economic and military ties with each of the 11 regional states over the past 25 years. A large part of the book is devoted to Southeast Asia\u2019s responses to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At the end of the talk Dr Storey will also provide an update of Russia-Southeast Asia relations in 2025 and how the region views the on-going Russia-Ukraine War.\nDr Ian Storey is a Senior Fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Singapore. He specializes in regional security issues, focusing on Southeast Asia\u2019s relations with the major powers and maritime security, especially the South China Sea dispute.

    "description": "The Liberal International Order as a Core-Periphery Order: An Alternative History with Multiple Deep Contestations, I offer an alternative macrohistory of the Liberal International Order (LIO) that was explicitly designed to perpetuate Western dominance and American hegemony. The LIO is better understood as a core-periphery order because inequality between the Western-core and the \u2018Restern\u2019-periphery was constitutive of it. (Re-)Imperialism\u2014not just liberalism\u2014remained a central ordering mechanism well after 1945. I show the two-way deep contestations between the liberal and anticolonial ordering projects, especially at the 1955 Bandung Conference. Contra the post-LIO pessimism of disorder/chaos, I argue that the normative agency of the Southeast Asian states informed by the legacy of Bandung is heralding a multiplex, multi-regional world order. As the declining inequality between the West and Asia transforms the core-periphery LIO, the emergent decentered world order will lack a core, whether Western/liberal or Asian. This deep transformation should be welcomed, not deeply contested, although coexistence and global integration require embracing deep pluralism, not liberalism.\nManjeet S.

    "description": "Exploring our Shared Humanity, Do you ever feel that you're just going through the motions? That life is a series of tasks, a pursuit of pleasure, or a race for self-improvement that never really satisfies? This isn't just a feeling; it's a fundamental human question about what it means to exist.\n\nDescription\nJoin experienced psychotherapist Rohit Grover for a six-week course that invites you to look beyond the surface of everyday life. In these two-hour sessions, we will explore the core tenets of existential therapy, moving away from the conventional focus on self and hedonism. Instead, we'll grapple with life's big questions:\n\nWhat does it truly mean to live a value-driven life?\nDo our personal values matter, or is the search for meaning just an illusion?\nWhat is the \"being\" part of \"human being\" all about?\n\nThrough guided discussions, reflective exercises, and insights from classic existential thinkers, Rohit will help you navigate this profound territory. This isn't about finding easy answers. It's about developing the courage to ask the right questions, to confront the realities of freedom, responsibility, and meaning, and to discover a more authentic way of living.\n\nThis course is for anyone ready to step off the treadmill and begin a deeper exploration of what it means to be alive. Come and find out what it means to truly exist\n\nUpon completion of this course, participants will be able to:\n\nDifferentiate between a life driven by external pressures or fleeting pleasures and one rooted in personal values and authentic meaning.\n\nIdentify and critically examine the core existential givens of human existence, such as freedom, responsibility, isolation, and the search for meaning.\n\nArticulate a personal understanding of what it means to \"be\" a human being, moving beyond a purely functional or biological definition.\n\nArrive at sensing rather than thinking. Sensing this existence, this dance of life. Widen your view of existence.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".",

There will be cups of tea available afterwards to help us integrate and ground.\n\n**THIS EVENT IS RESTRICTED TO 40 PEOPLE ONLY**\n\nDisclaimer\nGong baths are safe and supportive for most people.

We will then guide participants in somatic practices to offer accessible ways to reconnect with your agency.\nDuring this session, you will gain tools to increase your inner awareness, expand your bandwidth of awareness, and integrate emotion, sensation, and story. Together we\u2019ll explore the role of perception in our orientation to life and the choices we make, how our narratives can connect us with our agency, the power of curiosity, and dive into how our relational presence can often have more impact than our opinions.\nThis session is an invitation to restore connection, calm, and courage, to become more whole, more fully human, and more ready for what this moment is asking of us.\nAbout your host\nFreda is a curator, engagement practitioner, and connector, who works at the intersection of social change, community-building, and inner development. She is the Founder of the Goodlife Collective, which curates spaces that build connection, wellbeing and collective wisdom.\nDrawing on yoga teaching, somatic practices and adult development, Freda is interested in how we build our inner infrastructure - the capacity to work through discomfort, reconnect with our agency, and bring greater presence to relationships. Her background is in psychology, environmental-science and design, and she loves nerding out on ideas and conversations about unlocking our collective potential.",

    "description": "Katie Knowles PAM, Title:\nSelf-Disclosure of Sexual Dysfunction to Romantic Partners.\n\nAbstract:\nSexual dysfunctions (e.g., distress about levels of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain) are linked with poorer individual and relational wellbeing. Disclosing these dysfunctions to a romantic partner helps to mitigate these effects, however, such disclosures also risk rejection or relationship conflict. Existing models of disclosure do not adequately capture the complexities of disclosing sexual dysfunction, such as how costs and benefits are weighed simultaneously, the role of contextual factors, or how partner responses shape future disclosures. Three studies test a model of people\u2019s disclosure of sexual dysfunction. Study 1 reports a thematic analysis of people\u2019s social scripts about disclosing sexual dysfunction. Subsequent studies will test the influence of positive and negative partner responses and develop a scale to measure the anticipated costs and benefits of disclosing dysfunctions. Altogether, these studies build a framework explaining how and when people will disclose sexual dysfunction to romantic partners.\nPrimary supervisor: Dr Matt Hammond\nSecond supervisor: Dr Ally Gibson\nStaff and postgraduate students are cordially invited to attend. There will be an opportunity at the end of the presentation for audience to observe the panel questioning the candidate about the presentation and proposed research, and for audience members themselves to ask questions of the candidate.\n",

    "description": "LIFE DRAWING MEETS YOGA!, LIFE DRAWING MEETS YOGA!\nConnect with your body and your creativity in this all-levels workshop that combines vinyasa yoga practice with a fun and interactive Life Drawing class!\n\nThe Life Drawing session is based on the teaching methods of Cecil Collins, a British artist whose non-academic approach to drawing challenges you to leave your inhibitions at the door and work freely from your creative centre...much like yoga!\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t draw!,\u201d you say. Then even better! This approach is perfect for the artist and non-artist alike as it asks you to drop your expectations of what art should look like, inviting you to express the pose from within\u2026just like we do in yoga.\n\nDrinks & nibbles follow, along with a chance for k\u014drero and connection.\n\nGuided by JoElle Gragilla from South Coast Studio in Island Bay, who studied Cecil\u2019s methods in London and is an artist, art teacher and AWHI-trained yoga teacher. Co-facilitated by AWHI's Lachlan Broughton.\n\nInvestment: $75 (includes yoga class, mat & props, art materials, art lesson, herbal tea throughout and drinks & nibbles at the end!)\n\nWe've done this workshop before so can confidently say it's a REALLY FUN TIME! Definitely don't miss out!\n\n",

    "description": "Katie Knowles PAM, Title:\nSelf-Disclosure of Sexual Dysfunction to Romantic Partners.\n\nAbstract:\nSexual dysfunctions (e.g., distress about levels of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain) are linked with poorer individual and relational wellbeing. Disclosing these dysfunctions to a romantic partner helps to mitigate these effects, however, such disclosures also risk rejection or relationship conflict. Existing models of disclosure do not adequately capture the complexities of disclosing sexual dysfunction, such as how costs and benefits are weighed simultaneously, the role of contextual factors, or how partner responses shape future disclosures. Three studies test a model of people\u2019s disclosure of sexual dysfunction. Study 1 reports a thematic analysis of people\u2019s social scripts about disclosing sexual dysfunction. Subsequent studies will test the influence of positive and negative partner responses and develop a scale to measure the anticipated costs and benefits of disclosing dysfunctions. Altogether, these studies build a framework explaining how and when people will disclose sexual dysfunction to romantic partners.\nPrimary supervisor: Dr Matt Hammond\nSecond supervisor: Dr Ally Gibson\nStaff and postgraduate students are cordially invited to attend. There will be an opportunity at the end of the presentation for audience to observe the panel questioning the candidate about the presentation and proposed research, and for audience members themselves to ask questions of the candidate.\n",

    "description": "Men's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection, Men's Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\nMen\u2019s Circle: Honest Conversations & Connection\n\nIn a world where men are often expected to have everything figured out, this gathering offers a space to be genuine, not perfect.\n\nThis is a free event, with an optional plant-based dinner available for $15. While there\u2019s no obligation to stay for dinner, sharing a meal together offers a meaningful way to strengthen connections. Andre and Sri Jiva co-host this circle with a shared passion for creating authentic, supportive spaces where men can connect deeply\u2014offering this gathering simply because they believe in its importance.\n\nThe Men\u2019s Circle provides a safe and nurturing environment where men can share openly, express their feelings, and encourage personal growth\u2014free from societal pressures to be stoic or self-reliant. Through honest sharing and collective support, participants build resilience, deepen self-awareness, and strengthen their sense of identity and purpose.\n\nStructure of the Circle\n\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.\n\nA short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\n\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center. Only the person holding the object may speak, ensuring uninterrupted sharing.\n\nOpen Sharing: Anyone may choose to share while holding the object. Sharing is optional, and passing is always respected.\n\nActive Listening: While one person shares, others listen attentively without speaking, interrupting, or offering advice. The focus is on witnessing and being present.\n\nNo Judgments or Advice: Participants refrain from judging or offering unsolicited advice, creating a safe space for authentic expression.\n\nClosing: The circle may conclude with a group reflection, a moment of gratitude, or a simple acknowledgment of the shared experience.\n\nCircle Agreements\n\nSupportive Environment: We are here to uplift and support one another, fostering trust and brotherhood.\n\nFocus on the Present: Share what's alive for you now, focusing on your emotions and experiences to deepen emotional awareness.\n\nUse \"I\" Statements: Speak from your personal perspective using \"I\" statements to promote authenticity and responsibility. Avoid generalizations like \"we\" or \"us.\"\n\nNo Judgment or fixing: Refrain from judging others sharing or offering unsolicited advice, ensuring a safe and non-critical space.\n\nConfidentiality: What is shared in the circle stays in the circle. You may discuss your own experience outside the group, but keep others' details private.\n\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\n\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\n\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n................................................................................................\n\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!! This booking is for FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER\n                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cWithin the DNA is written not only our histories as individuals but the whole history of the human race \u2026 patterns of DNA that have come down to us virtually unchanged from our distant ancestors \u2013 ancestors who are no longer just an abstract entity but real people who lived in conditions very different from those we enjoy today, who survived them and brought up their children.\u201d ~ Bryan Sykes (The Seven Daughters of Eve)\nReturn to MAIN EXHIBITION WEBSITE - link coming soon",

Whether you are single or partnered, whether your past experiences were harmonious or painful, each relationship reflects the inner dance of the masculine and feminine within us.\n\nThroughout history, these sacred energies\u2014Yin and Yang\u2014were meant to complement and support each other. Yet, distortions, suppression, and separation have created wounds that echo through generations. Many of us carry beliefs such as:\n\nMen cannot be trusted.\nWomen are not safe.\nLove must be earned.\n......\n\nRarely do we pause to sit with these wounds and meet the unhealed parts of our inner feminine and masculine. These energies may hold not only personal pain but also ancestral imprints passed down through time\u2014shaping the way we experience love and connection today.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f In this mini workshop, you will be guided through a shamanic journey to explore and heal your inner archetypes. Together, we will:\n\n\u2728 Release old wounds and limiting patterns carried by the inner feminine or masculine.\n\u2728 Make peace with the shadow side of our psyche.\n\u2728 Embody the wholeness of the Divine Masculine and Feminine within.\n\nWe will close our circle with a sacred forgiveness ritual, bridging the separation and returning to a state of balance, wholeness, and love.\n\nThis journey is open to everyone\u2014whether you are new to shamanic work or have walked this path before. All that is required is an open heart and willingness to connect deeply within.\n\n\ud83c\udf38 You\u2019ll leave with:\n\nA renewed sense of love and harmony within yourself.\nGreater balance between your inner masculine and feminine.\nA deeper connection to spirit, self, and the essence of oneness.\n\nEvent Details\n\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, September 21st\n\ud83d\udd52 3:00\u20136:00 pm\n\ud83d\udccd Lotus Yoga Centre \u2013 Sanctuary, Paraparaumu\n\ud83d\udcab Energy Exchange: $55 per person\n\ud83c\udf3f Limited to 12 participants\n\n\u2728What to bring:\nA water bottle, journal, cushion or blanket for comfort.\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Rides from Wellington may be arranged\u2014please contact me if needed.Contact: 0272541272\n\nAbout Your Guide - Fery Qiu\n\nI am a Shamanic Healer who is committed to the healing path that help people heal from the core of their being. From suicidal depression to shamanic path, my spirituality is not based on how many trainings, meditations, and ceremonies I have done, it\u2019s coming from a deep embodied experience to transform pain into wisdom and empowerment. The shamanic path is a way of being; we allow ourselves to go deeper within to connect all things that come from oneness. I loved my work, which has been proven to help people really change their lives. If you are curious about what this mini workshop could bring, having an open mind and open heart, you will be surprised by how much can be done just in this brief journey within.\n\n\n\nWith love,\nFery Qiu\n\n",

We were also making experimental attempts into the world of radio, with the birth of Mouthfull\u2019s first international streaming server, playing music 24/7 (also live events a few times a week).\nIf we travel even further back in time, 2017 was the debut of the \u201cMouthfull Radio\u201d episodic series (~20eps) - but we consider the ongoingness the real thing to celebrate.\nMoving towards present day ~ through a vast richness of hosts, events, music, shows, zines, selectors, connections, pop ups, and story-times.

They change fast, they don\u2019t always play nice, and they\u2019ve caught out even the most experienced skippers. Each year, we see serious incidents and tragedies happening on our bars, so it\u2019s super important to know your stuff before you head out.\nThat\u2019s where we come in. Join us at Manawatu Marine Boating Club for a free and relaxed seminar. You\u2019ll hear straight from local Coastguard skippers and boating legends who\u2019ll share their real-world tips, local knowledge, and a few stories from the water.\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover (and chat about):\n\nUnderstanding the local features of your bar\nReading and interpreting the conditions when planning a trip\nGetting your boat and your crew bar crossing ready\nHow to handle your boat while crossing\nHow to do a bar crossing report (and why it\u2019s worth it)\nWhat to do if things go pear-shaped\nIt\u2019s interactive \u2013 so bring your questions, share your own experiences, and have a yarn with others in the boating community.\nBring your mates too \u2013 whether they\u2019re brand new to boating or have been around since the days of paper charts and handheld compasses, there\u2019s something in here that could save a trip\u2026 or a life.\n Why it matters:\nIn 2024, 23% of craft-related drownings happened during bar crossings.\n5 lives were lost due to capsizing while crossing a bar.\nOlder blokes are still the most at-risk \u2013 but everyone can make safer choices with the right knowledge (and a lifejacket on).",

It\u2019s also just a different & cool way of meeting new people by getting a bit out of your comfort zone and skipping the small talk!\n\nJoin us for games, talks, and connections with friends you haven\u2019t met yet. Join if you get annoyed after being asked what you do, where you are from, and how long you have been in Wellington every single time you meet someone. If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you. \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\n\ud83c\udf88 HOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll never have to speak in public if you don\u2019t want to!\n\n\n\ud83d\udd79 HOW TO JOIN?\n\nTake 2 minutes to fill out our form \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\nhttps://lu.ma/ftstwellington6\n\nOur events are limited to 30 handpicked guests to ensure a cozy atmosphere.

The focus is on camping, coffee, and having a fun time with relatively short kayaking times on the water.\n\nThe schedule for Wellingtonians is: on the Thursday 29th Ferry over to Picton, in at 12:30, launch from Picton beach head over to Kumoto, tents up, Friday - paddle around the Bay of Many Coves, stop for coffee / lunch / chips / shower at Punga Cove, stay at Camp Bay. Maybe a quick trip over to Bumine Island with empty boats. Saturday night at Ratimira for camping / snoozing. Sunday - up early, on water at 8am, paddle back to Picton in by 12, lunch, on 1pm sailing. So 4 days with Blumine as an optional paddle, mostly shortish trips. We might shift the plan around depending on the weather, but that sets out the general plan.\n\nFor the ferry you need to book your own tickets and I would urge you to get your ferry tickets now as they go fast. If you are concerned about the weather get the fully refundable tickets. When you buy your ticket select the \"kayak\" option. Any questions ask them in the comments below.\n\n",

The focus is on camping, coffee, and having a fun time with relatively short kayaking times on the water.\n\nThe schedule for Wellingtonians is: on the Thursday 29th Ferry over to Picton, in at 12:30, launch from Picton beach head over to Kumoto, tents up, Friday - paddle around the Bay of Many Coves, stop for coffee / lunch / chips / shower at Punga Cove, stay at Camp Bay. Maybe a quick trip over to Bumine Island with empty boats. Saturday night at Ratimira for camping / snoozing. Sunday - up early, on water at 8am, paddle back to Picton in by 12, lunch, on 1pm sailing. So 4 days with Blumine as an optional paddle, mostly shortish trips. We might shift the plan around depending on the weather, but that sets out the general plan.\n\nFor the ferry you need to book your own tickets and I would urge you to get your ferry tickets now as they go fast. If you are concerned about the weather get the fully refundable tickets. When you buy your ticket select the \"kayak\" option. Any questions ask them in the comments below.\n\n",

This 4-session block course teaches teens how to use drawing to process hard feelings and access their own inner resources, which can be used at home as visual journaling.\nDates\nThis block course consists of 4 workshops:\n4.15pm-5.30pm\nTuesday 19th August - Metaphors for feelings\nTuesday 26th August - Uncovering needs\nTuesday 2nd September - Unlocking self-compassion\nMonday 8th September - Curiosity in direction\nCost\n$184 total ($46 per session)\nIncluded in each session\nYou will be guided by Lara Phillips, a trained creative facilitator in Interactive Drawing Therapy, through drawing prompts (similar to a guided meditation or journaling) to draw out where you are at and draw out your own inner guidance. No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz\n\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing.

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil.

This will be their first public appearance of the 2025\u20132026 cycle. Come and hear our nation\u2019s youngest and most talented choral singers as we celebrate Mahuru M\u0101ori.\nWe\u2019re in for another treat this Mahuru M\u0101ori at the National Library. Last year, Te R\u014dp\u016b Rangatahi Waiata o Aotearoa The New Zealand Youth Choir gave a public concert to celebrate this special month, and now the teina \u2014 The New Zealand Secondary Students\u2019 choir (NZSSC) \u2014 will appear for a public performance as their tuakana did, performing waiata to celebrate te \u0101taahua hoki o te reo t\u016bturu o Aotearoa.\nBring your hoa, your colleagues and your wh\u0101nau kia whakanuia \u0113nei rangatahi me te reo rangatira \u2014 this concert is not to be missed!\nNau mai te katoa! Everyone is welcome!\nAbout the choir\nThe New Zealand Secondary Students\u2019 Choir has achieved considerable success since its formation in 1986. NZSSC has won titles such as Children\u2019s Choir of the World at Llangollen Eisteddfod 2022, and over their near 40-year existence, embarked on 15 international tours, including Canada, Singapore, China, the United States, South America, Australia, and South Africa.\nUnder the direction of Sue Densem, the NZSSC is a tira waiata of Aotearoa\u2019s finest young voices (14\u201318) and offers a two-year membership where rangatahi tour throughout the country and learn from some of the country\u2019s top choral teachers and composers. At the end of their two-year cycle, the r\u014dp\u016b rounds out their membership term by embarking on an international tour, performing concerts and competing in choral festivals.\nNew Zealand Secondary Students\u2019 Choir website: https://www.nzsschoir.com/\nImage: Kaiwaiata of the New Zealand Secondary Students\u2019 Choir perform in China (2024).

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover.

Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour, Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour\nIndie-Folk Artist Colette Rivers and her band will be performing her intimate new album, The Backyard Wonder.\n\nIndependent artist Colette Rivers is releasing her second full-length album, The Backyard Wonder, an intimate exploration of healing, change, and the quiet beauty of ordinary moments.\n\nThis album holds special meaning for Rivers: after being diagnosed with cancer in July 2023, her planned sophomore release had to take a back seat to recovery. But when the cancer returned in early 2025, she felt compelled to finish and release the album, not just as a legacy project, also as a celebration after hard times, with a focus on how \u201cyou can find the wonder in life, even in your backyard.\u201d\n\nA lifelong creative, Rivers records, mixes, and produces in her home studio in Masterton, and plays every instrument heard on The Backyard Wonder. Her debut album, Memory Lake (2020), was shaped by early years spent in the US, and her move to Taup\u014d at age 11; this was followed by a nationwide tour. Now based in the Wairarapa and working as a secondary school drama teacher, Rivers continues to move between solo performance and full band sets, while staying rooted in the acoustic traditions that define her sound.\n\nWith her right arm partially paralysed following recent treatment, Rivers has gathered a group of close friends to help bring the songs of The Backyard Wonder to life (especially its intricate fingerpicking parts) for a run of live shows. She\u2019ll be touring the Wellington and Wairarapa regions from August through October, finishing with a set at the Wellington Folk Festival.\n\nFor updates, and behind-the-scenes glimpses, visit www.coletteriversmusic.com or follow @colettemusic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nOpening for Rivers are artists:\n\nPhil Masters\nPhil Lively-Masters is an experienced, well travelled singer songwriter who specialises in writing the sort of Sun Kissed West Coast Laurel Canyon Americana that made Neil Young, Stephen Stills and the Byrds famous. With a powerful, honey soaked voice that has won praise and support slots from legendary American country rock pioneers like The Jayhawks and original cosmic cowboy Steve Young, Phil has 20 years worth of road worn original songs to pull on, including tracks from the critically acclaimed CANYON RYDE album 'Free To Be' and some choice country rock covers to weave a spell on any listener.\n\nSaali Marks\nA singer, songwriter, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, Saali Marks hails originally from the\nSouth Island, but has made Wairarapa his home for the last 20 years, where he lives on a farm\nwith his family and teaches music at Kuranui College.\nSaali has played in numerous bands over the years, in a wide range of styles from proto-punk\nto psychedelic dub, covers, originals and fully improvised music with no discernible genre, on\nstages throughout Aotearoa since 1991. Currently he fronts the Wellington ska band Battleska\nGalactica.\nThroughout and alongside it all Saali has indulged his love for songwriting and solo\nperforming, developing a unique style, rooted in folk and blues, and inspired by greats from\nacross the decades. A skilled guitarist, Saali rarely plays straight ahead chords, and an\neducation in jazz has informed his ear for harmony, the beauty of dissonance, tension and\nresolution, with unconventional song structures, alternate tunings and intriguing melodies.\nAlthough not adverse to penning the odd love song, most of Saali\u2019s lyrics tend to focus on\nother aspects of the human condition, from religion and politics to our relationships with the\nenvironment and our own minds.\n\n",

Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology.\n\n",

On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology",

Host and drummer of what\u2019s been billed for some time now as Wellington\u2019s Longest-Running Jazz Residency. And rightly so! Little could we have known when this gig began at The Realm in Hataitai in August 2005 that it\u2019d still be going in 2025. It\u2019s a fantastic achievement. Longer residencies have occurred in our town but nothing currently running holds a candle to that sort of effort by a single artist, at a single venue, in this town (and possibly beyond).\nWe boast quite the legacy: two Tui-nominated live albums, several bar owners, many managers and staff, hundreds of featured professional musicians and young artists, 500-odd gigs, uncountable numbers of pizzas, beer, whisky, and much laughter and joy. From local music students to top-notch international artists we\u2019ve seen it all.\nIt\u2019s a huge milestone - 20 years of high quality music played by a massive variety of talented people.\nThe exciting programme is largely finalised and is pasted below.\nMark the date!\nTable bookings 04 974 2207 or info.therealm@nzvenueco.nz or therealm.co.nz and click on \u2018book a table\u2019\nGreat ambience, good company, superb kai and stellar music.

    "description": "Make Some Noise - choral music that matters, After a successful performance of Mozart\u2019s classic Requiem in D Minor in May, Supertonic is back with a programme of contemporary choral music that matters. \nOn the evening of Saturday 8 November, Supertonic will present Make Some Noise at the Lower Hutt Town Hall. This is the first time the choir has performed in the Hutt Valley, and they hope to see some new faces in the audience as they bring this programme of  meaningful music from around the world to the stage.  \nMake Some Noise highlights issues of social justice, including indigenous, women\u2019s and civil rights and climate action. The programme is rich and varied, from Katerina Gimon\u2019s arrangement of AURORA\u2019s Apple Tree, a Norwegian pop song addressing the urgency of the global climate crisis, to Robert T. Gibson\u2019s arrangement of the gospel standard This Little Light of Mine. Oliassa by Malika Tirolien utilises an invented language to invoke a call from the ancestors, while Alex Vollant titles their piece Auass meaning \u201cchild\u201d in the Innu language to honour the generation of elders who survived the Residential Schools in Canada. The impact of sexual harassment and assault on women is highlighted in MILCK\u2019s I Can\u2019t Keep Quiet  and Lillia Ruocco and Emmanuelle Ader\u2019s Canzone r\u00f2 curtiell\u2019. Closer to home, Make Some Noise features a set of waiata in teo reo M\u0101ori to highlight the importance of indigenous voices in Aotearoa New Zealand, including Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s Whakarongo. This waiata-\u0101-ringa incorporates Ngoi P\u0113whairangi\u2019s beliefs and methodology on teaching te reo M\u0101ori.   \nLed by co-Musical Director Virginie Pacheco, Supertonic offers Make Some Noise as an invitation to concert-goers to consider the causes that are important to them. In connecting with audiences through the striking and impactful works of the composers featured in this programme - by turns harmonious, raucous, gut-wrenching, resolute - the choir hopes to inspire those listening to make some noise in their own lives. \nSupertonic was formed in 2014 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and strives to  push the boundaries of what choral music can be. The choir has performed concerts that cover the entire musical spectrum, from major classical works including Vaughan Williams' Mass in G Minor, Vivaldi's Gloria and Faure's Requiem to pop and rock spectaculars celebrating hits of the 70s, 80s and 90s from the likes of Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Elton John, Queen, and Celine Dion. The choir has performed alongside The Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, joined Brett McKenzie, the NZSO and The Muppets for the Jim Henson Retrospectacle,  shared the stage with Mama Kin Spender at Coastella, and performed in national civic commemorations, street festivals and at community events.",

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nMercy Lie:\n\nDriving all night under the stars, along the highways of human experience, the original songs of Mercy Lie will haunt, surprise, remind and affirm.\n\nMercy Lie is the musical guise of Laura Chester-Murphy. An instinctive sound maker from an early age, Laura just wants to keep the music rolling. There\u2019s a lot of sound from that little acoustic guitar and a voice to match. In the songs, you will find fierce independence, crushing vulnerability and a reflective wit that speaks to a life of figuring stuff out along the way.\n\nWith influences ranging across and not limited to folk, funk, country, goth, indie and 90\u2019s rave, Laura puts the focus on crafting percussive earworms that won\u2019t leave your head easily. The music of Mercy Lie is a unique soundscape, sculpted with ambience and depth, the silence unforgettably painted by explorations into the motivations of both the self and fellow travellers.\n\nMercy Lie is about connecting over the foibles of polite society and the ways we are wired to weave around each other.\n\nHometowns, journeys, mysteries, ghosts, growing up, messing up, speaking out, moving on. If you like getting nostalgic over something and nothing all at once, buckle up.\n\n\u201cMercy Lie\u2019s novel approach to the guitar and talent for songwriting make for the perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that voice to come from that mouth.\u201d\n\u201cAn acoustic delight!\u201d\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience.

Spiritual undertones and overtones give way to an uplifting joyfulness, of triumph over difficulties and life lessons learned and expressed through music.\n\nWith Cathy Elizabeth on vocals & acoustic guitar, Chris Ewers on bass, Murray James on drums and Izzy and Dion on guitars, these guys have got the goods and are ready to deliver!\n\nSo come along and allow yourself to be immersed and transported, moved and entertained.

With a deep adoration for Pacific musical reference points and a desire to explore new sonic ground, LEAO synthesises non-traditional tonalities with a fa\u2018asamoa spirit, creating what some have called \u201cniu wave\u201d and \u201cPacific neo-psychedelia.\u201d A creative enigma and phenomenal live act since the release of their critically acclaimed debut GHOST ROADS in 2019, LEAO has continued to expand its vision with the 2024 single TAEAO / MEA UMA - a sparkling glimpse into a significant body of alternative Pacific music currently in development. The group is now actively working towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\n\nRomi Wrights\n\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring stories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke festival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release mid to late 2025.",

Next up is local producer, musician and songwriter Phil Riley, followed by a good 50 mins of toe-tapping grooving with The Grey Dog Band.\n\nMore about the artists:\n\nRachel Hird is a Wellington based singer-songwriter. She grew up playing the piano and studying classical music. Nowadays she writes and performs her own songs, best described as \u2018songs from the heart'. She is constantly inspired by people she meets in the world of music such as musician, vocalist, songwriter and mentor Brenda Shearer, and sing-songwriter Charlotte Yates whose songwriting school is a place where many songs have been crafted. Rachel's songs are inspired by people, places and events of the past and present. She is planning an EP release early 2026.\n\nPhil Riley is a full-time writer /producer with a recording studio in Korokoro. He's a wordsmith and melodic songwriter with influences from the Beatles and Paul Simon to Coldplay. Phil started on the English Club circuit as a guitarist, then drummer and keyboard player/singer in NZ bands.\nRiley got to know Grammy winner Jon Mark of White Cloud Records (Naxos), and this led to a series of 6 Celtic and World music albums for the label, including The Blessing Tree, which reached #11 on the US radio play charts and was nominated for 5 NZ Tui music awards.\n\nRiley has tracks on European and US albums alongside artists such as Enya, Sarah McLachlan, Sinead O\u2019Connor, Secret Garden and Clannad. The compilation \u2018Celtic Journey\u2019 reached #1 on the American Billboard charts.\n\nOver the past few years, the art and craft of songwriting has become a priority, driving his recording and performing focus and moving his musical centre of gravity. His first \u2019new\u2019 indie album \u2018Five Dollar Rockets\u2019 featured a stellar cast of instrumentalists and singers.\nIn this unplugged \u2018sneak preview\u2019 of songs from the first and upcoming second album he\u2019ll be joined by long-time talented music buddies Charlie Harter and Marty Parlane on guitars and the wonderful Brenda Shearer on vocals.\n\nThe Grey Dog are a deluded bunch of cork-sniffers who think they will improve with age. They are John Broadbent \u2013 vocals, guitar and harp, Martyn Parlane \u2013 vocals and guitar, Graeme \u201cGrey Dog\u201d Sullivan \u2013 bass and vocals and Greg Bates - drums. They often play around Courtenay Place, where they use their music to lure passing sailors to their doom. Their musical style is wide-ranging, but basically Boomer. They hope their music will provide some fuel for your hearts, heads, and toes.\n\nThe Realm is a family friendly venue with a great vibe, good food, including children's menu and a good range of refreshing beverages available at the bar.

    "description": "The Dave Wilson Quintet, Dave Wilson presents his quintet in a special performance of newly arranged material from his two most recent projects: Free, Free: Meditations on Liberation (debuted in 2025), and Ephemeral (Thelonious Records, 2023).  \n\nFree, Free draws from legacies of musical collectivity in an invitation to explore the expansive possibilities for what liberation might sound like. Ephemeral, described as \u201cquite spiritually intense music\u201d by The Guardian, explores the transience of human relationships with one another and the natural world through alternatively floating and driving improvisatory impulses of Wilson and his ensemble.\n\nThe quintet for this performance will present the music of Free, Free and Ephemeral in a brand-new configuration: Wilson on saxophone and bass clarinet, Mana Waiariki on violin, Seth Boy on bass, Callum Allardice on guitar, and Abe Baillie on drums.\n\nDave Wilson is a saxophonist, clarinettist, composer, producer, and interdisciplinary scholar. His music bridges avant-garde and experimental music with various groove-oriented styles from the worlds of jazz, R&B, electronic music, and more. Before relocating to Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington in 2016, Dave grew up in the Chicago area, lived for a decade in Los Angeles, and spent several stints living in Skopje, North Macedonia.\n\nPart of the Wellington Jazz Festival 2025",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene and GIB.\nCPD points: 10\nTIMING:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLECTURE DATES:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\n\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.\n\n",

After being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition at the age of eleven that left him paralyzed from the waist down, Wes experienced a miraculous recovery for which the doctors themselves had no medical explanation. This experience, along with a great deal of study and soul searching in his later teen years, solidified his interest in faith and in engaging the beliefs and worldview perspectives of others. He spent his high school years in Northern Ontario and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and three children.\n\nWesley is currently the Central Canada Director for Apologetics Canada and has been a guest on a variety of public platforms, from The Joe Rogan Experience and Piers Morgan Uncensored, to Apologia Radio and Daily Dose of Wisdom. He has participated in numerous public dialogues, debates, and interfaith events on issues of belief and religion globally.\n\nHe holds a BA in sociology from York University, a Masters of Theological Studies from Tyndale University, and is currently doing a PhD in New Testament at the University of Toronto\u2019s Wycliffe College.\n\n",

Whilst there is some faster efforts needed to come out on top of any of these \u201cdisciplines\u201d, the aim of the game is just to get out there and enjoy yourself at whatever pace suits you.\n\nThe added extra this time is not only an extra hour, explained below, but the plan is to tie this into the elevation for a group effort for a BTR Everest Challenge, more details around this when I can get a team entry together, but really keen to try and pudh the limits of what has been done before.\n\nDetails:\nDate: 26th October - Backup date is the week after\nTime: 6am-1pm - (1 hr per week it too Hialry to conquer everest!)\nLocation: The Wither Hills, Basecamp: Sutherland Stream picnic area - this will be where we have the whiteboard & a bit of an \"Aid station/Bag drop\" situation going on.\n\nDisciplines:\n- \"Vernon Vert Masters\" Highest total elevation (solo/team) - pretty self explanatory, but between the hours of 6 am- 1pm any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day (solo or in a team) counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n\n- \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop (solo/team) - Crush the covenant Loop is a 3.75km, 300m vert loop running from Sutherland Stream Picnic Area to the Mt Vernon Summit & then back down again, the loops can be run in whichever direction you would like, just be aware that this is a 2-way track and there will be a bit more traffic than you would usually see up on it. The aim of the game here is to get as many laps in as possible between 6 am-1pm; this will also count toward your elevation total for the \"Vernon Vert Masters\"\n\nThe Basics:\n- This is an open event to anyone who wants to participate\n- The event is open from 6am-1pm - any elevation in the Wither hills farm park accumulated within these hours on this day counts towards your total for the \u201cTotal Elevation\u201d part of the challenge\n- We will have a basecamp/aid station at the Sutherland stream picnic spot. This will be the hub for the meet-up and the start/finish line for the laps of \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d.\n- No minimum time, you can start whenever you like in the 6 am-1pm timeframe and go for as long as you would like.\n-You can do as many laps/summits/cumulative elevation as you like/can within the timeframe.\n- Teams - Teams can be between 2-5 people for the overall elevation challenge, and your total elevation will be your total accumulated. You will need to pre-register your team with Mikey before the day so that we can have you on the scoreboard.\n- You will need to confirm your solo/teams total elevation with Basecamp by 1.30pm on the day, in person. If you are unable to do this for whatever reason, you will need to confirm and prove details via message or screenshots so we can add them to the total tally.\n\n\nWho's up for some hills?\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nWe at Blenheim Trail Runners don\u2019t see ourselves as event organisers and as such, do not have any consent or insurance; we deem this as a \u201cClub Meet-up\u201d.\nWith that, the expectation is that you are 100% responsible for yourself and take part at your own risk.\nBe aware, as this isn't a formal event, there won't be any official timekeeping, marshals or trail markers. There will be DIY DIY-type whiteboard to note down your shared laps & elevation, and we will provide details via trail maps for the \u201cCrush the Covenant\u201d loop.\nWe are unable to provide any/can not be held responsible for: Urgent medical attention (we will however, assist wherever possible, there will be a first aid kit at base camp), nutrition, hydration ( there is public access throughout the hills and in two points on the \u201ccrush the Covenant\u201d loop), the condition of the trail on the day or the weather.\n\n",

This more advanced class is ideal for those who are already competent at soldering simple joins, annealing, and basic tool use on their own.\n\nStudents must have completed an 8-week block with ring-making and bezel settings or equivalent. If you have not done one of our 8-week beginner\u2019s classes or are unsure of your level because you may have done a few different shorter classes, please contact us and we can advise you.\n\nA more advanced set of students means that your tutor can support you and the group to take on more exciting and complex challenges. They will work with the group to find appropriate projects for you and for the class as a whole. Each 8-week block may focus on a particular skill topic, rather than doing loads of different topics with each student over the block. This means the students will benefit from a more in-depth learning experience, supported practice, and peer support from fellow students.\n\nLevel 2 students learn to solder more competently on their own using chain-making as a way to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project so they have something familiar to hone their skills on, as well as take on a new skill. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet, or a more complex bezel setting.\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple projects they can work on self-directed in class\u2014more chains or simple bezel settings are ideal to help them strengthen their soldering skills\u2014alongside a challenge project that might be a shelf setting (an adaptation of a bezel setting that can take faceted stones), a tube setting, or a larger bezel setting for a box or brooch.\n\nThis class fee does NOT include materials for any student. All metals and stones, as well as quality findings and chains, are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it thriftily in future projects!",

In 2025 the event raised $25,531 which was remarkable.\n\nK\u0101piti Run for Youth will be open for sign up early in January 2026 >> https://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/signup\n\nAt that time, we will be seeking individuals and teams to get together to walk or run from Paraparaumu Beach (Maclean Park) to Raumati Beach and back. For those choosing the 12km walk or run, they will do two circuits of the course.\n\nChoose your adventure \u2013 a 6km or 12km run or walk along the beautiful K\u0101piti coastline. Whether it's a leisurely stroll or a mad dash to be the first across the finish, you choose the event that suits you best, and which of our amazing fundraising partners you're going to raise funds for. On race day grab your dog and your mates and head down to the beach for fun, family and fitness. Registration takes place from 8.30am to 9.45am with a briefing at 9.45am and all walkers and runners starting together at 10am.\n\nOnce your profile is set-up online, let your family, friends and work mates know so they can sponsor your efforts. We encourage every participant to raise $20 through sponsorship instead of paying an entry fee. All entrants receive regular campaigns to motivate their sponsorship efforts along the way.\n\nK\u0101piti Run for Youth prides itself on being a sustainable, family-friendly event that is all about supporting each other and having fun. Join your community for a feel-good morning on the beach. Your fundraising makes a difference in the lives of our young people! BYO sunhat, sunscreen, and water on the day, and there are sponsored spot prizes, treats for the kids, certificates for participating and free Paek\u0101k\u0101riki Mini Pops for everyone at the end.\n\nCheckout our FAQs over on our website >> https://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/faqs\n\nCloser to the event, go to our website to sign up or sponsor someone that you know who is participating >>\nhttps://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/search\n\nAll registrations and sponsorship are handled securely and confidentially on the K\u0101piti Run for Youth website that is powered by Raisley and supported by Stripe online payments.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBUSINESS SPONSORSHIP\nPlatinum $1,000+, Gold $500, Silver $250, Bronze $125 is available for businesses who want to support the underlying work of this event and rangatahi youth of K\u0101piti. In 2025 we were grateful to 58 local business sponsors to the value of $15,125 that can be viewed on our website >> https://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/sponsors\n\nSponsorship for the 2026 campaign will open late in January 2026\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nFUNDRAISING MODEL\nWe focus on returning as much money as we can back to the K\u0101piti community to those working with rangatahi. All funds raised are split 70% to the official Fundraising Partner chosen by the participant at the time of registration and 30% is retained towards running and promotion of the event.\n\nFUNDRAISING PARTNERS\nBirthright K\u0101piti, Challenge for Change K\u0101piti, K\u0101piti Basketball Association, K\u0101piti College, K\u0101piti Kindness Trust, K\u0101piti Youth Support, No 49 Squadron Air Cadets K\u0101piti, \u014ctaki College, Paraparaumu College, The Shed Project K\u0101piti, Whirlwind K\u0101piti, Work Ready K\u0101piti, ZEAL K\u0101piti >>\nhttps://www.kapitirunforyouth.co.nz/fundraising-partners\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWELLNESS UPDATE\nWe operate within the Event Sector Voluntary Code.

Combine wax working and stone setting methods to produce a set of rings cast in your choice of copper, brass, bronze, white bronze and silver - beginners welcome!\nAll materials included in the course fee.\n\nDescription\n\nExpanding on the Lost Wax Cast Rings class, students in this course get to add precious gemstones to their cast jewellery process!\nExperiment and create sculptural cast metal rings set with beautiful stones in a variety of colours.\nThis beginner friendly jewellery class is also fun and engaging for returning students to diversify their skills and set stones in new ways.\nStudents will learn to work with a range of jeweller waxes, including hard wax, modelling wax, sheet wax, melting wax and more to create wax 'masters', setting stones in wax, as well as turning raw metal casts into shining ready-to-wear jewellery.\nStudents choose their favourite wax masters to be cast professionally outside of class time, transforming the designs into their choice of metals, and are returned to students to polish and finish their casts in class.\n\nThe course fee includes a range of small precious gemstones, casting 2 rings in either copper, brass, yellow bronze, white bronze, and 2 rings cast in Sterling Silver.\n\nThe bold, organic forms and textures of the lost wax processes offer a wide range of creative possibilities beyond the scope of fabrication methods alone (soldering metal sheet and wire). Setting faceted stones in wax offers a simpler and more experimental way of adding stones to jewellery compared to fabrication settings.\n\nAll materials are included in the course fee. Please bring pen and paper and your reading glasses (if you use these) and wear clothing and footwear suitable for a workshop environment.\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\nDesign and create unique sculptural ring designs\n\nCarve hard jeweller\u2019s wax ring master designs to fit a chosen finger size for casting\n\nSculpt soft jeweller\u2019s wax master design to fit a chosen finger size for casting\n\nCombine hard and soft jeweller\u2019s wax to create unique designs ready for casting\n\nSet faceted gemstones in wax for \u2018cast-in-place\u2019 setting methods\n\nFile, sand and polish metal casts into finished jewellery\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

    "description": "Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days, Advanced Flush Setting in Two Days\nThis workshop is ideal for advanced students who have already learned how to set cabochon stones. Over two three-hour sessions, 20 and 27 September, 10am-1pm, you will be given an understanding of the technique of setting faceted stones using a setting burr, hammers, punches and burnishing tools. This is the first step in learning to flush set facet cut stones so they sit below the surface of the metal.\n\nSession 1 will cover the technique, demonstrations and the basics of preparing and cutting the setting. Students will be shown how to set their stones, and may begin to do this in class, but will then go on to repeat and practice the technique in their own time.\nThey can do this at home, or for a small extra cost, can stay on at the studio to practice setting for the afternoon.\n\nSession 2 will pick up on the setting techniques, reminding and refining essential steps in the process. Troubleshooting can be covered in this class, as well as learning to clean up the settings. The principles of this setting technique will be covered in a few different scenarios, as some students may wish to take this skill into different styles or directions.\n\nThe option for students to have a half-day bench hire after class will also apply to this session.\n\nWhat is provided: class fees cover your practice metal (copper) and stones (CZ) and detailed handouts that are useful for you to take away to refer to when practising and honing your skills.\n\nCorrectly sized drills and setting burrs will be provided in class, but students must purchase their own burrs for practice after class and any future bench hires. These are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nWhat to bring: Advanced students can bring projects to set stones into, but please note the metal must be at least 2mm thick and we do not allow brass to be used as a project or practice for beginners. The metal must be copper or sterling silver.\n\nStudents should bring either a craft magnifier or magnifying lenses/glasses. If you have your own flex shaft tool you plan to use at home for drilling and setting, please also bring this along so that your tutor can advise on the best way to use it. We have two drilling machines in the studio, and these must be shared between the students, so if you have a machine, do bring it.\n\nPractice bench hire after class $20 per person (till 4pm) must be booked in advance.\n\nWorkshop fee $195, Early bird $175 till 24 August.\n\n",

    "description": "Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal International Order, Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal International Order\nAssociate Professor Christina Lai will speak on Taiwan's trade practices against the backdrop of Cross-Strait tensions\n\nAbout this Event\n\nAbstract\nOver the last decade, China has punished countries that undermine its territorial claims and foreign policy goals with measures such as restricting trade, encouraging popular boycotts, and cutting off tourism. These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods. Her works have appeared in the Politics, International Politics, Political Science, PS: Political Science & Politics, Journal of Contemporary China, Pacific Review, and Asian Security.\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 04:30 PM - 05:30 PM\nWelcome reception with refreshments and light catering\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 06:30 PM\nKeynote address: Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal Intern\nHost: Christina Lai\n\n\n",

    "description": "PANEL TALK: BALLROOM CULTURE, Ballroom is a queer subculture. The Ballroom scene today was created by Black and Latinx trans women in the late 1960s in Harlem, New York. Since then, ballroom has taken over the world with scenes in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania.\nThe Aotearoa Ballroom scene was ignited by M\u0101ori and MVPFAFF+ youth in T\u0101maki Makaurau over 10 years ago, and has since inspired other leaders across the motu to forge their own Ballroom communities in their respective cities. \nIn preparation for The Grand Kiki House of Marama Ball, hear from influential figures who have made significant contributions to their own scenes. With international Icons and Legends coming to Aotearoa for the first time, there has never been a better time to learn and enhance our own knowledge and experience of Ballroom. \nFeaturing ballroom leaders Arturo Mulan (NYC, USA), Matyouz Royalty (Paris, EU), Jaycee Iman (Auckland, NZ), Karamera Marama and Rom\u00e9 Marama.\nPanellists\nIcon Arturo Mulan (NYC Father of the International House of Miyake-Mugler) (he/him) is a ballroom Icon and Legend from the beating heart of Ballroom, NYC. Arturo has been involved in Ballroom since 1996 and has established himself as a visionary choreographer and community leader, with the title of NYC father of the international mainstream House of Miyake Mugler. His influence spans competitive wins, global workshops, and has dedicated his time to bringing diverse artistry into ballroom culture, and ballroom culture into diverse arts opportunities; such as Legendary - Season 2 (HBO Max), Brooklyn Nets performances, Cats the Jellicle Ball on Broadway and more.\nIcon Tantine Matyouz Royalty (International Godmother of the International House of Gorgeous Gucci) (he/she/they) is a ballroom Icon and Legend from the Paris Ballroom scene and is the creator of the \u2018Fashion Killa\u2019 category. They discovered voguing and ballroom culture in 2009 during a trip to New York which they believe changed their life. Their impact within ballroom spans several categories: Commentator vs Commentator, Hands Performance, Runway and Fashion categories. Matyouz has become a staple commentator and music artist within the ballroom community, with a repertoire of modelling and influencer opportunities in their resum\u00e9.\nLegendary Overall Founding Mother Jaycee Iman aka Jaycee Tanuvasa (she/her) is an inter-disciplinary S\u0101moan artist and choreographer of fa\u2019afafine, femme queen & trans experience. Born and raised in South Auckland, T\u0101maki Makaurau, her work is firmly rooted in community as she places autonomy and story sovereignty at the core of each of her projects. She celebrates the fullness of young, queer, brown life and works collaboratively to create empowering and responsive reflections of this across a range of media such as theatre, film and activations.\nFounding Mother Karamera Marama (he/they) is an emerging multi-disciplinary, queer and M\u0101ori artist professing in Graphic Design, Dance and Performance Arts. They are the Co-Founding Mother of the trailblazing Kiki House of Marama, Co-Director of P\u014dneke-based queer arts collective OV\u0100 and member of the Aotearoa Ballroom council. Karamera has been involved in Ballroom since 2020 competing in Performance and Fashion categories and winning numerous grand prizes across Aotearoa & so-called Australia respectfully; most notably within Vogue Fem categories.\nFounding Mother Rom\u00e9 Marama (he/him) whakapapa to Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu, Ng\u0101ti Hineuru, and Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa. He is an emerging multi-disciplinary performing artist, as well as the Co-Founding Mother of the House of Marama and Co-Founding Director of OV\u0100. For the past five years, he has been a prominent figure in Aotearoa Ballroom, both competing and facilitating events. Renowned in the RUNWAY category, Rom\u00e9 has secured multiple Grand Prize titles across Aotearoa and so-called Australia.\nFacilitator: Kasi Marama (he/him/barb) \nKasi Valu ('Eua, Ma'ufanga, Lapaha / Tonga) Full-Time sergeant of Gag city #Barbz Part-Time hater of the Rihanna #Navy and Casual staff member of the #Beyhive.

    "description": "Harmonic Sound Journey at Space with Claudio, Harmonic Sound Journey at Space with Claudio\nWe invite you to a special evening of Sacred Harmonic Sound with multi-instrumentalist Claudio Escutia. This immersive sound journey offers a deeply restorative experience that invites you to settle into stillness, reconnect with the heart, and explore a sense of inner spaciousness through vibration and tone.\nClaudio skilfully layers the sounds of gongs, crystal and Tibetan singing bowls, Native American flutes, and other traditional instruments, enhanced through high-quality audio equipment so the sound can be both heard and felt throughout your body.\nHarmonic sound and vibration offer the nervous system a chance to truly rest. In this state of relaxation, the thinking mind softens, and we find connection to citta \u2014 the heart-mind. From this place, silence arises naturally through the vehicle of sound.\nThis experience is open to everyone. No previous yoga or meditation practice is needed.\n\nWhat to bring:\nYou are welcome to bring your own yoga mat, though studio mats are also available. We will provide bolsters, blankets, and eye pillows for your comfort.\n\nBooking is essential \u2014 spaces are limited and this event often fills quickly.\n\nAbout Claudio\nClaudio is a multi-instrumentalist musician originally from Mexico City and now based in Wellington. Born into a family of musicians, he began playing music at a young age and later studied classical guitar. His journey led him to Montreal, where he explored jazz, world music, and spiritual sound traditions.\n\nExtensive travels in Asia and Europe deepened his connection with Indian music and yogic philosophy. He studied Tibetan singing bowls in Kathmandu and Varanasi, and has since worked with a wide range of instruments including the sitar, esraj, bansuri, harmonium, flutes, gongs, and voice.\n\nClaudio\u2019s work blends technical skill, deep presence, and a profound respect for the healing power of sound.\n\nLearn more or listen to Claudio\u2019s music here:\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/claudioescutiasounds\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/claudio_yoga_sound_healing\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/soundhealingyogamusicclaudio\n\n\n",

With a string of releases on Berlin-based PHTM, T\u0101maki Makaurau-based Gypnotica, and an impressive catalog of self-releases, he consistently showcases his singular and original interpretation of dance music.\n\nInstagram.com/e.li\nelihoff.bandcamp.com\nabyssalsoundworks.bandcamp.com\n\n\nHUNTER \u2014 Hang the Saints / Haven\n\nRaised in Kaik\u014dura, Aotearoa, Hunter's dark and atmospheric sound often contrasts the beautiful environment she grew up in.

As the co-founder of \u201cHang The Saints\u201d and resident of \u201cHaven\u201d, Hunter is all about creating safe, inclusive spaces for people to connect through the music she loves.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sspoonsnake/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hunter-mccrory-334790608\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/bC3qeA6pUxBoMo7P9\n\n\nLUDUS & RIZZO \u2014 Tonic Collective\n\nTonic Collective is the recent endeavour of Ludus and Rizzo, inspired by the people, places and spaces of their experience touring China with BIRDPARTY and Vera Ellen.

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\n\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.\n\n",

The pair met at the Elam School of Fine Arts. Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995. Wendyhouse output has been somewhat sporadic ever since, but with EE monk\u2019s recent return, the pair have returned to performing live.\n\nWendyhouse music was initially played on toy musical instruments, the kind that fit inside a Wendy house. Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\n\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo. Guitar, toy keyboard and vocals are the Wendyhouse instruments of choice.\n\n---\n\n\nDSLB\n\nDSLB is the solo project of Chrissie Butler (the shouty bass playing half of the now sleeping duo, mr sterile Assembly). An offshoot from Chrissie's other band Ditzy Squall, DSLB (Ditzy Squall's Lunch Box) is a showcase for a love of long endings and the hum things make when you hold them close to your ear. Performed live, DSLB is an improvised mash-up of ancient record players, purring keyboards, kitchen utensils and found objects. Soundtracks for short films and hand drawn comics are also residents in the lunch box. Recordings are released by skirted Records.\n\nhttps://skirtedrecords.com/dslb/\n\n---\n\nvegetable.machine.animal\n\nNew solo project courtesy of Mr Sterile, in which living fungal and plantlife inform a modular synthesiser with biofeedback.

Emergence is the latest show by English physicist, presenter, and personality Professor Brian Cox. He takes to the stage at TSB Arena to contemplate the dazzling complexity of the universe and how it\u2019s built on profoundly simple principles. \nEmergence is also a scientific history of 400 years of human discovery. How did we come to understand so much about the cosmos? Guided by mathematics, curiosity, and an aesthetic sense of symmetry, our species has begun to read the story of the Universe. We\u2019ve started to carry our spacecraft to the edge of the solar system and outwards to the stars. Brian\u2019s engaging style makes these questions come to life. The audience will be left awestruck and thrilled as the show covers vast topics in an accessible way. \nBrian has appeared in many landmark science programs for BBC radio and television over the last 15 years, from the Peabody Award-winning Wonders of the Solar System to the worldwide hit series The Planets.

The winner of the Golden Bear 2025 is a lucid and tender chronicle of the unforgettable experience of first love.\n\nOriginally intended as the second chapter in his trilogy and released in Norway as such, Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Dreams ended up premiering internationally as the last. But it secured a fitting crown to the trilogy, by winning the Best Film at the 2025 Berlinale, thus inducting Haugerud among world class auteurs.\n\nDreams emanates from two of Haugerud\u2019s passions: literature, as he first gained prominence in his homeland as writer, and the cinema of French master \u00c9ric Rohmer, distinguished by sentimental skirmishes brimful of finely written dialogues.\n\nThe film\u2019s protagonist and narrator is Johanne, a 17-year-old student who falls for her new French teacher Johanna. Johanne manages to get close to her crush, who nonchalantly ignores how her student\u2019s devotion is veering into affection. Yet, this chronicle of first love is told in a voice over reflecting the memoir that Johanne wrote on her experience \u2013 meaning that things may or may not have happened as she says. The memoir is also read by the girl\u2019s mother and grandmother who muse on the girl\u2019s literary talent and provide a layer of irony and melancholy to an unfathomably lucid and tender chronicle of the universal and unforgettable experience of first love. \u2014 Paolo Bertolin",

Distance and death became everyday realities for Kiwis at home \u2013 and caused griefs that were at times taboo and suppressed.\n\nDame Gaylene Preston frames seven women, including her own mother, against a black background that creates a stage for their candid, unadorned and surprisingly intimate wartime recollections, as they look back from the 90s in interviews conducted by oral historian Judith Fyfe. The acclaimed documentary, which combines these shared testimonies with personal photographs and newsreel clips, conveys the immense pressure to conform to the value of stoic sacrifice for the cause under the scrutinising eye of neighbours, and reveals lesser-seen layers of resilience.\n\nMarriages in the first flush of romance were cut short, pregnancies were navigated alone, conscientious objectors were met with ostracisation and American servicemen scorned, in a nation united around support of their boys in combat overseas \u2013 a state of affairs in which women were often granted little voice, as they took on more labour, and absorbed life-changing losses. \u2014 Carmen Gray",

Despite barely being able to feed themselves due to crippling food shortages caused by international sanctions, the family is randomly selected to prepare a cake as part of the forced national spectacle observing Saddam Hussein\u2019s birthday.\n\nFrom bucolic wetlands to bustling city streets, Lamia embarks on an ingredient-hunting odyssey that mixes equal parts sweet absurdity and bitter reality. Bartering with hawkers, dodging authorities, and begging the kindness of strangers, the young girl encounters the full gamut of humanity, from good to grotesque, as she approaches her ludicrous mission with innocent determination.\n\nDirector Hasan Hadi deftly evokes humour and open heartedness against a bleak background of oppression and war. Cinematographer Tudor Vladimir Panduru summons rich texture from the gorgeous locations, beautifully backed by a flowing soundtrack of traditional strings. \u2014 Adrian Hatwell",

Set in 1954, the film follows Esmeralda Arboleda, a fiercely intelligent leader who sparks a revolution in a society deeply rooted in patriarchal traditions - a revolution that culminates in a fierce and decisve debate. A women group embarks on a historic struggle to bring the issue of women's right to vote before the National Constituent Assembly. With bold marches, radio appearances, and a brilliant media strategy that puts them on the front page, they achieve their goal, but the real challenge begins during the debate, where they face fierce opposition. Esmeralda Arboleda must endure personal attacks from the assembly members, and just as she is about to speak, she receives a heartbreaking call: her son has suffered a serious accident. She is torn between her duty as a mother and her commitment to the cause, with an unfavorable outcome. Although all seems to be lost, her perseverance leads to a historic victory when women's suffrage is finally approved, marking a turning point in Colombia's history.\n\n",

He was the \u201clittle Doctor\u201d, a single-minded despot wielding tyrannical power and casting an oppressive shadow. As I began to understand more of his life, I realised that there was little appreciation of a man who had contributed so much.\u2019 \u2014John E.Martin\n\nIsaac Featherston was at the heart of some of the most significant developments in New Zealand from the 1840s colonisation by the New Zealand Company to the abolition of the provinces in 1876. A doctor, newspaper editor and politician, he advocated for the provinces against the domination of central government, while also being primarily responsible for the relocation of the capital from Auckland to Wellington in 1865.\n\nKnown amongst M\u0101ori as \u2018Petatone\u2019 and with a reputation for directness and honesty, he was at the very centre of P\u0101keh\u0101\u2013M\u0101ori relations, and in his 1857 official portrait is depicted alongside leading rangatira Te Puni and Wi Tako.\n\nAbout the author: Dr. John E. Martin has researched and written about New Zealand history since the 1980s, teaching in universities and employed as a historian in the public sector. He was parliamentary historian in the 2000s and 2010s. His publications include rural and labour history, the history of science and engineering, and social and political history. His books include The Forgotten Worker (1990), People, Politics and Power Stations (1991 and 1998), Holding the Balance (1996), The House: New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives, 1854\u20132004 (2004), Parliament\u2019s Library (2008), Honouring the Contract (2010), Illuminating Our World (2017), A Colonist\u2019s Gaze (2018) and most recently Empire City: Wellington Becomes the Capital of New Zealand (2022).",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\n\n\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods. Her works have appeared in the Politics, International Politics, Political Science, PS: Political Science & Politics, Journal of Contemporary China, Pacific Review, and Asian Security.\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 04:30 PM - 05:30 PM\nWelcome reception with refreshments and light catering\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 05:30 PM - 06:30 PM\nKeynote address: Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal Intern\nHost: Christina Lai\n\n\n",

The installation brings together the practices of Justine Fletcher, Christine Brimer, and Rita Takeuchi to draw attention to the fleeting essence of daily life, the interplay of absence and presence, and the ever-changing nature of time and memory.\nExperience is always slipping away; time, memory, or an event can only be grasped in their passing, in their trace, or in their absence. Short, intermittent chimes highlight this ephemerality, making duration palpable through moments of presence and absence. Paintings emerge from an attunement to everyday encounters and their emotional resonance, while sculptural and woven forms unravel and shift, emphasising process not as a means to an end, but as a state of becoming. Together, the works suggest that sometimes the only way to \u201chold\u201d something, whether a moment, time, or an atmosphere, is by revealing its impermanence.\n",

    "description": "Porirua Parkrun, What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Porirua will show you how.  \nMost Porirua homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nPorirua has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Porirua.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Porirua is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives.",

    "description": "Slow Grind Fever [AUS] - Wellington Jazz Festival, Express from Melbourne, Australia and crossing international waters for the first time this October, Meow is excited to welcome the slowest, spookiest, smokiest and swingin-est club night Wellington has ever seen: 'Slow Grind Fever'.\nFor this one-night-only episode of SGF Wellington, founder Richie1250 (106.7 PBS FM) will be joined by fellow Melbourne radio alumnus Dr. Popalotacorn (RRR, 98.1FM Raglan) and Wellington's own belle of the airwaves Miss Juliet (RadioActive.FM Americana)\nSlow Grind Fever was born in 2012 when Richie1250 hired a Russian Cultural Centre ballroom and threw a slow dance party for his 30th birthday, and it's been running as a regular monthly club night ever since. Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

    "description": "XCOMMUNICATE, XCOMMUNICATE\nThe formidable powerhouse duo COMMUNICATE return to Wellington in November with their clubnight, XCOMMUNICATE, for one night only.\n\nKnown for their long sets that incorporate decades of sound, Cyril Orson and Heylady have been punishing dance floors across Aotearoa since they joined forces 3 years ago. Off the back of a monstrous summer, which saw them play 19 shows up and down the country, the pair have spent most of 2025 in the studio finessing their own brand of audio alchemy and preparing to release their label, also named XCOMMUNICATE.\n\nUsually XCOMMUNICATE is a 6 hour journey though decades and sonic realms, however as Heylady is still recovering from a mighty dose of burnout they\u2019ve roped in a couple of their good friends, who happen to be some of Wellington\u2019s finest, to join them as they lay down four hours of four to the floor.\n\nHalo is a mainstay on Wellington dancefloors and it was a no brainer asking her to be on this lineup. A DJ since 2000, she has played festivals across the country and never fails to rock her slot. Her set at Taniwha\u2019s Den last summer was a big highlight and one of the best of the festival. Halo\u2019s ability to drive forward thinking sound and her clever construction of sets are just two reasons you need to be on her floor.\n\nDJ Coda is the godfather of techno in New Zealand. With a career that spans decades, he isn\u2019t just a DJ but a dedicated promoter and one of the trustees of NZ\u2019s longest running student radio station, Radio Active. Part of the COMMUNICATE family from the get go (and a longtime collaborator of Heylady\u2019s), DJ Coda is a master of his craft and never fails to deliver. Armed with knowledge , taste and a hefty love of Detroit, DJ Coda is the man when it comes to rocking the dance floor.\nFirst release tickets are on sale now, grab yours before they are gone and come and dance the evening away with four of the best. We recommend arrive early so you don\u2019t miss out on any of the sets, they are all going to be killer.\n\nIMPORTANT INFO:\nOur event is a safe space for all. If you or someone you know is feeling unsafe or harassed, please approach one of the DJs or bar staff. If you are behaving badly and impacting others ability to have a good time safely, you will be removed. Please act with respect and care for your fellow attendees at all times, no means no and this goes for conversations as well as more intimate requests.\n\n",

Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 20% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions. Post workshop consulting services such as mentoring the development of or reviewing a staff wellbeing plan can also be provided.\nPost Workshop Consult:\nSchools and Kuras have the option of a 90 minute consult with Barry in 2026 to review their staff wellbeing plan.\nAN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNING WITH INTERNATIONALLY RESPECTED AND AWARD WINNING MENTAL WELLBEING PRACTITIONER AND SUICIDOLOGIST, BARRY TAYLOR\nBarry has worked in mental wellbeing promotion and suicide prevention/postvention for 37 years at the local, national and international levels.  His extensive experience includes sitting on state and national government advisory committees; designing, implementing and evaluating suicide prevention programs; writing suicide prevention guidelines, training packages and community resources; providing technical advice to community based and national mental wellbeing and suicide prevention programs.  He has worked extensively with schools both here and overseas supporting management and staff in the event of a suicide. He wrote the first suicide postvention guidelines for schools in 1990, developed the first national suicide prevention guidelines for schools in Australia in 1999 and reviewed and updated the NZ guidelines in 2010.\nHe has led multiple \u2018firsts\u2019 in mental wellbeing both in Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas.

He has examined the impact of discrimination, internalised stigma, social exclusion or inclusion on mental wellbeing along with the role of human rights as an enabler of wellbeing.\nHe embraces a holistic understanding of wellbeing and has an interest in the role spirituality and ecology contributes to a person's wellbeing. He uses a population health and systems change approach, drawing on transformational change theory and collective impact.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to promote well wh\u0101nau, workplaces and communities and for the incorporation of wellbeing principles in public policy and social outcomes such as education, training and employment.\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

    "description": "Exploring our shared humanity, Join experienced psychotherapist Rohit Grover for a six-week course that invites you to look beyond the surface of everyday life. In these two-hour sessions, we will explore the core tenets of existential therapy, moving away from the conventional focus on self and hedonism. Instead, we'll grapple with life's big questions:\nWhat does it truly mean to live a value-driven life?\nDo our personal values matter, or is the search for meaning just an illusion?\nWhat is the \"being\" part of \"human being\" all about?\nThrough guided discussions, reflective exercises, and insights from classic existential thinkers, Rohit will help you navigate this profound territory. This isn't about finding easy answers. It's about developing the courage to ask the right questions, to confront the realities of freedom, responsibility, and meaning, and to discover a more authentic way of living.\nThis course is for anyone ready to step off the treadmill and begin a deeper exploration of what it means to be alive. Come and find out what it means to truly exist\nUpon completion of this course, participants will be able to:\nDifferentiate between a life driven by external pressures or fleeting pleasures and one rooted in personal values and authentic meaning.\nIdentify and critically examine the core existential givens of human existence, such as freedom, responsibility, isolation, and the search for meaning.\nArticulate a personal understanding of what it means to \"be\" a human being, moving beyond a purely functional or biological definition.\nArrive at sensing rather than thinking. Sensing this existence, this dance of life. Widen your view of existence.\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".",

    "description": "Katie Knowles PAM, Title:\nSelf-Disclosure of Sexual Dysfunction to Romantic Partners.\n\nAbstract:\nSexual dysfunctions (e.g., distress about levels of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain) are linked with poorer individual and relational wellbeing. Disclosing these dysfunctions to a romantic partner helps to mitigate these effects, however, such disclosures also risk rejection or relationship conflict. Existing models of disclosure do not adequately capture the complexities of disclosing sexual dysfunction, such as how costs and benefits are weighed simultaneously, the role of contextual factors, or how partner responses shape future disclosures. Three studies test a model of people\u2019s disclosure of sexual dysfunction. Study 1 reports a thematic analysis of people\u2019s social scripts about disclosing sexual dysfunction. Subsequent studies will test the influence of positive and negative partner responses and develop a scale to measure the anticipated costs and benefits of disclosing dysfunctions. Altogether, these studies build a framework explaining how and when people will disclose sexual dysfunction to romantic partners.\nPrimary supervisor: Dr Matt Hammond\nSecond supervisor: Dr Ally Gibson\nStaff and postgraduate students are cordially invited to attend. There will be an opportunity at the end of the presentation for audience to observe the panel questioning the candidate about the presentation and proposed research, and for audience members themselves to ask questions of the candidate.\n",

Whether you are single or partnered, whether your past experiences were harmonious or painful, each relationship reflects the inner dance of the masculine and feminine within us.\n\nThroughout history, these sacred energies\u2014Yin and Yang\u2014were meant to complement and support each other. Yet, distortions, suppression, and separation have created wounds that echo through generations. Many of us carry beliefs such as:\n\nMen cannot be trusted.\nWomen are not safe.\nLove must be earned.\n......\n\nRarely do we pause to sit with these wounds and meet the unhealed parts of our inner feminine and masculine. These energies may hold not only personal pain but also ancestral imprints passed down through time\u2014shaping the way we experience love and connection today.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f In this mini workshop, you will be guided through a shamanic journey to explore and heal your inner archetypes. Together, we will:\n\n\u2728 Release old wounds and limiting patterns carried by the inner feminine or masculine.\n\u2728 Make peace with the shadow side of our psyche.\n\u2728 Embody the wholeness of the Divine Masculine and Feminine within.\n\nWe will close our circle with a sacred forgiveness ritual, bridging the separation and returning to a state of balance, wholeness, and love.\n\nThis journey is open to everyone\u2014whether you are new to shamanic work or have walked this path before. All that is required is an open heart and willingness to connect deeply within.\n\n\ud83c\udf38 You\u2019ll leave with:\n\nA renewed sense of love and harmony within yourself.\nGreater balance between your inner masculine and feminine.\nA deeper connection to spirit, self, and the essence of oneness.\n\nEvent Details\n\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, September 21st\n\ud83d\udd52 3:00\u20136:00 pm\n\ud83d\udccd Lotus Yoga Centre \u2013 Sanctuary, Paraparaumu\n\ud83d\udcab Energy Exchange: $55 per person\n\ud83c\udf3f Limited to 12 participants\n\n\u2728What to bring:\nA water bottle, journal, cushion or blanket for comfort.\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Rides from Wellington may be arranged\u2014please contact me if needed.Contact: 0272541272\n\nAbout Your Guide - Fery Qiu\n\nI am a Shamanic Healer who is committed to the healing path that help people heal from the core of their being. From suicidal depression to shamanic path, my spirituality is not based on how many trainings, meditations, and ceremonies I have done, it\u2019s coming from a deep embodied experience to transform pain into wisdom and empowerment. The shamanic path is a way of being; we allow ourselves to go deeper within to connect all things that come from oneness. I loved my work, which has been proven to help people really change their lives. If you are curious about what this mini workshop could bring, having an open mind and open heart, you will be surprised by how much can be done just in this brief journey within.\n\n\n\nWith love,\nFery Qiu\n\n",
