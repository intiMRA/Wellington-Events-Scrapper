    "description": "Photography \u2013 The Art of Paying Attention\nIn this lecture Anne Noble will discuss modes of collaborative practice across a series of projects that spans her work with bees as well as current projects concerning the environmental degradation of our waterways. In 2023 Anne Noble was commissioned by Ng\u0101i Tahu to create an archive of images that would reveal the deteriorating state of freshwater across South Island waterways and the resulting impact on mahinga kai customs and practices. These photographs supported the Ng\u0101i Tahu Statement of Claim heard recently in the High Court in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, seeking recognition of Rangatiratanga (authority) over wai m\u0101ori (fresh water) within Ng\u0101i Tahu takiw\u0101. An exhibition, drawing on the archive and created collaboratively is currently showing in \u014ctepoti, at the Dunedin Public Art Gallery.\nFree entry, however bookings are advised. Doors open at 6.15pm, Lecture at 6.30pm. Lecture will finish at 8pm, please join us for refreshments afterwards.\nAnne Noble has been at the forefront of photographic practice in New Zealand since the early 1980s, creating bodies of work that mark sustained engagement with particular places, sites, histories, species and more recently the environmental degradation of land and water. Her images are known for their beauty, complexity and conceptual rigour and for their persistent inquiry into the ways photography impacts our perception, understanding and relationship to the natural world. Anne Noble is Professor Emerita of Fine Arts (Photography) at Massey University, Wellington and is the recipient of numerous awards including the 31st Higashikawa Photography Award (2015), an Arts Foundation Laureate Award (2009) and US National Science Foundation Artists and Writers Award (2008). She has exhibited widely both nationally and internationally and her work is held in collections throughout the world.\nThis year's lecture is one of a number of events celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Photography programme at Te Kunenga ki P\u016brehuroa Massey University.\nThe Peter Turner Memorial Lecture was established in 2008, in the memory of the late Peter Turner historian, curator and former editor of Creative Camera magazine who came from the UK to live in NZ in 1981. His contributions to the medium of photography during his time in New Zealand spanned curatorial work, writing, reviewing and teaching. He is remembered for his passion for the medium, support of photographers and their work and his special love of practices he termed lyric, transcendent or poetic documentary photography. Founded on reflections on this legacy the annual Peter Turner Lecture is conceived as a means to broaden discussions about the social and cultural value of the medium of photography today \u2013 as an expanded field inclusive of a broad range of lens based media and approaches.\nIn association with the Peter Turner Lecture a fund has been established by the Massey University Foundation to support the Peter Turner Scholarship that was launched in association with the lecture and each year provides a postgraduate student scholarship for a student engaging with social and cultural issues through the medium of photography in its broadest sense.\nThe Peter Turner Fund has been established by the Massey University Foundation to grow the support this scholarship can offer young photographers aspiring for a career the lens based arts."

    "description": "Life can be hard.\nWe want to help you manage life when it\u2019s difficult. And we know that for many people ACT has a profound and positive effect on wellbeing.\nACT for Everybody is a 6 week course where you\u2019ll learn how to interact more helpfully with thoughts, feelings and behaviours that you struggle with. You\u2019ll develop your ability to move towards what matters to you even when you\u2019re feeling bad. And you\u2019ll do this with a small group of others.\nWe know that people wonder whether groups are for them! We find that discovering ACT in a group provides special opportunities to learn from each other and highlight how all our minds get stuck in struggle at times. The course includes chances to share but you can choose how much or little you contribute. Here is some feedback from a previous participant:\nThe course gave me scheduled time to stop and reflect in a non-threatening environment. It wasn\u2019t rushed, it wasn\u2019t pressured but there was a lot of skills, knowledge and tools that through the course became part of me. The course opened up struggles within me that I did not know were there and helped me deal with them. It gave me tools to deal with feelings that sent me in a spiral to dark places. It taught me that I can always do something. I went to the course believing that I was not brave enough to live my life and left with the courage to live it.\nWhat is ACT?\nWe think about Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as a way of helping people live their lives based on their values, and without painful thoughts and feelings getting in the way.\nEmotional pain is a normal and unavoidable part of human experience. Often it is the struggle to avoid painful thoughts and feelings that leads to suffering. ACT is literally about taking action: accepting what you can\u2019t change and committing to what you can.\nWhat can I expect?\nACT for Everybody is a supportive, interesting, safe, confidential and fun course. It\u2019s facilitated by experienced psychologists with between 8 and 14 participants. It runs for 2 hours on Tuesday afternoons, from 4:00pm to 6:00pm.\nYou need to join us for the first night of the course in order to take part in the rest of the course.\n\n\nGiselle Bahr is a clinical psychologist and co-founder of ACT Wellington. She has been using ACT in her practice for over 15 years, and has been trained and supervised by many of the world\u2019s leading ACT therapists and researchers. Giselle has worked at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, in Private Practice with adults and adolescents, and trained new clinical psychology students at Victoria University of Wellington. Giselle has developed and facilitates a group introducing ACT to Parents.\nTania Stanton works as a clinical psychologist at the Maternal Mental Health Service. She has previously worked in Infant, Child, Adolescent and Family Services where she co-developed and facilitated therapy groups for young people and their parents using ACT. She is enthusiastic about the help that ACT can offer to enhance people's lives."

No adverts.\nArriving: We'll be there at least 15 minutes early to say hello and check you in.\nRuntime: 1hr 37mins\nSeating: We won't have assigned seating, but let us know if you have any requirements, e.g. need aisle seat, and we'll pop a name card on a seat for you. We'll be in the 55 seat cinema on the ground floor.\nWho are we?\nWe're a group of friends (Rachael, Bethany, Leigh and Jenny) who all love crafting. We saw this type of event being run in Australia and were inspired to give it a go. We ran this event last year and it was super fun! Join us again this year :)"

Its key insight is that our science, and the technology it spawns, is deeply connected to the flawed but redeemable human persons who do the science, and who make and live with technology... and its consequences\nBr. Guy Consolmagno, SJ, is an American Jesuit brother and planetary scientist, currently serving as the Director of the Vatican Observatory and President of the Vatican Observatory Foundation. He is known for his research on meteorites, asteroids, and the evolution of small solar system bodies, as well as his popular writings on astronomy and faith. He holds degrees from MIT (SB, SM) and the University of Arizona (PhD in Planetary Science) and has worked in astronomy at Harvard and MIT before entering the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in 1989.\nBr. Guy has been at the Vatican Observatory since 1993, curating the meteorite collection and conducting research. He was appointed director in September 2015 by Pope Francis. His research focuses on the physical properties of meteorites and asteroids, including their spectra and how they relate to the evolution of the solar system. He is the author of several popular books, including \"Turn Left at Orion\" (with Dan Davis) and \"Would You Baptize an Extraterrestrial?\" (with Paul Mueller, SJ). He is also a popular speaker on the topic of faith and science, and serves on the governing boards of various international scientific organizations.\nThis event is co-hosted by Te Kupenga \u2013 the Catholic Leadership Institute, Te Herenga Waka - Victoria University of Wellington and the Wellington Astronomical Society"

    "description": "Sourdough for Beginners - $120 (paid via internet banking)\nCome join us for a hands-on, in-person sourdough workshop at Willow Corner Collective headquarters (aka my home)! This workshop is currently the only hands-on sourdough workshop being offered in the Nelson region - I teach and demonstrate to you and then you get to mix and practice on your own dough as we go along.\nWhether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this event is perfect for anyone looking to master the art of making sourdough bread, learning from someone who has 10+ years of experience. Perhaps you've found all the Youtube tutorials and Instagram how-to's overwhelming and are keen to learn via an in-person class. Then this is for you! I've baked hundreds of loaves in the last year alone, sold at a market, and hosted a pop-up shop. However, my passion really lies with teaching others to bake their own sourdough in their own homes, for their own families (or small businesses - one day!).You will be taught, demonstrated to, and then you get to have a go yourself; whilst learning my tips and tricks along the way. Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only*I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 7pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. Unfortunately if for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though. In extenuating circumstances I may be able to hold your ticket for a future workshop; this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight!From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody"

    "description": "Do you worry about your sons attitude & behaviour?\nDoes he need help building courage, confidence & resilience?\nDoes he struggle to care about or see his potential?\nOr are you just tired of repeating yourself over and over again only to get the same result, or even worse\u2026no response at all?\n\nIf you answered yes & can relate to some or maybe even all of these then the Motov8ing Boys event is for you and it's time you met John McMahon.\n\nMotov8ing Boys' is an event for Boys aged 11-17 and their parents; the goal is to help them to understand the power of a positive attitude, how to develop competnece & confidence, how to change destructive behaviour, how to identify personal potential & understand the importance of self-respect & respecting others, especially their parents.\n\nOne of the biggest deficits seen in young people today is a lack of social & emotional intelligence. This can lead to a whole range of problems with their personal development at home, at school & with friends both on & off line.\nIt can put unnecessary strain on relationships with siblings & sometimes unsustainable pressure on parents. Leading to everything from arguements, fights, anxiety, stress & depression through to significant family breakdown.\nIf you can relate to some or maybe even all of these then a Savage Angel event is for you.\nWho is John McMahon from Motov8 aka The Rev?\nJohn or Rev as he\u2019s more commonly known is a youth specialist with over 30 years experience working with young people in schools, sporting clubs & families across Australia, NZ & the UK. Through Motov8ing Boys events, seminars & talks delivered in schools, Rev has helped inspire & influence thousands of young people to make smarter more informed decisions.\nBoys will be boys\" is often used to explain away & excuse why boys say & do silly things. As a coach/mentor and parent himself Rev would rather see this statement reflect a very different sentiment. Rev's aim is to inspire boys to choose to become history making, high achieving & uniquely productive young men. Men of substance, conviction & hopes to do something significant with their lives.\nWhy This Event - Why Motov8ing Boys?\nAs parents it is our role to guide and advise our sons but it's for that exact reason they often don't want to listen. Sometimes the same message communicated in a different way and by a different person, is all that's needed to start to turn things around.\nThis event gives parents the opportunity to expose their sons to real advice about life in terms of when the 'rubber hits the road'. Rev engages young males through the use of motorcycles & draws from his years of rider experience to help them to navigate the twists, turns & obstacles that inevitably come across on the ride of life. This event is about much more than motorcycles so even if that's not you or your sons thing there's still a lot of value to be taken away from it.\nRev's communication style is direct, confronting, hard hitting, relative & impactful on both the boys & their parents. He's as direct as they come but it's his raw vulnerability that earns him the right to say what needs to be said to both boys & parents.\nWhat parents are saying about this event.\n\nBrad & Morgan Thomas We went to the Gold Coast event feeling like we were on our own going through this parenting journey that is raising boys aged 12 and 15. We soon relaised that we were not alone in our pain and frustration. Rev had this way of cutting through games our boys play with us to manipulate things to serve themsleves. We walked away with some very confronting truths to face and embrace. Our boys walked away with some clear areas to improve on and some very strategic answers to excuses and objections they hide behind.\n\nHayley & Hunter Motov8 and Rev absolutely nailed it at the boys' event in Toowoomba! I went along with my 12-year-old son and his friend, and they were hooked from the get-go. Rev\u2019s hard-hitting, raw truth style - mixed with powerful metaphors about life and motorbikes - really landed with them. They were so engaged they didn\u2019t want to leave at the end and were both keen to chat with Rev afterwards. It\u2019s not often you see two young boys hang off every word like that! Highly recommend for anyone raising boys who need strong, real, and relatable role models.\n\nClaire Kelly A friend suggested it and I just had that immediate gut feeling, that we had to take our boys. So, with real effort we dragged 3 tired boys out, not really knowing what to expect. It was great! When we got in the car afterwards, one of them said: \"Now that was surprisingly good, I actually really enjoyed it\"; and the other 2 agreed. Win! Thank you Rev! We will def be interested in further workshops.\n\nSeona Maybery My boy really didn't want to go to the workshop. I dragged him there with the attitude that it was going to be boring and so on. He couldn't believe that we would have to sit there for 2hrs but at the end of it he couldn't believe how quickly the time went. The comment was also \"that wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be\". A win win situation for me and I really think he'll get something out of it. I know that I learnt some things myself. Thanks for teaching us some great strategies to help with the anger. So much to take away from this workshop.\n\nSarah Verheyen Thank you. Your words are empowering for our teenagers, as I saw in my own boys tonight. The reflection that I saw in them was astounding, and the little changes that started as soon as we walked in the door were proof of the way that you captured their attention. I myself found it very inspiring to hear the way that you have learned how to be a parent - truly inspiring for people like me who have to teach themselves as they weren't taught from an early age. You have given me some steps to further this journey. Your stories and anecdotes really engaged us all.Thanks Rev.\n\nAaron & Bree Clifford We've been questioning our parenting for some time, doubting ourselves and our values. We walked into this event and we knew very little about it but it was recomended to us by the wellbeing coordinator at our sons school. It was not like anything we had been to before and in a good way. Everything Rev said connected with us in a deep and real way. We walked out and it was like we were both on the same page again. We know what's best for our son and will parent through the pain to get him where he needs to go. Thanks Rev for having the balls to do what you do and say what you say.\n\nSonya Carter Thanks for your info tonight, I have to say you connected with my boys (both 12) really well in a short space of time (I didn't expect this!). I was impressed with your matter-of-fact approach to neuro-diversity (and so was my neurodiverse son, he's never heard ASD spoken about so bluntly and he liked it.) The three things you said parents want was spot on and our families best take away. Shining a light on our young men's mental health crisis is so important - thanks for your dedication. Take care\n\nAll reviews are posted up exactly as we reicive them, to read more CLICK HERE\n\nMum's please don\u2019t just send your boys with their dad or your partner, where possible come as a family even if you\u2019re separated. There are things that need to be said to your son & it\u2019s much more impacting on them if you\u2019re there next to them. There are just as import things that need to be said to you in front of them as well.\nIt's very comon for the same boys who whinge, bitch, protest & complain to their parents about having to come along to also be the first boys to come & show gratitude to Rev & their parents after the event is finished.\nSo, turn off their tech/screens/headsets & bring your boys out to a night of inspiration, motivation mixed with some TUFF love & good advice that could just change your & their lives forever.\nWhat about the girls & their parents?\nWe also have a girls event called Savage Angels happening at the same location the following evening at the same time. To find out more CLICK HERE\nA bit of a look inside a Motov8ing Bioys event.\nEvent feedback from parents & boys."

In terms of casualties, the morning of 12 October 1917 was - and is - the worst and bleakest day in New Zealand\u2019s history of warfare. 846 of our young men were killed on that morning alone and, by the end of the day, 2740 were dead, wounded or missing.\nTo commemorate those who fought and died, our Society Board invites you to join us and other guests as we remember the 1917 battle at Passchendaele.\nThe function will be hosted at Parliament Buildings by Cameron Brewer MP, Member for Upper Harbour and also a member of the Society.\nOur guest speaker will be Dr Graham Howie, PhD, OStJ, a career paramedic and university lecturer in paramedicine. In his talk \"Mighty few of the bearers are left\" he will tell us about the work of stretcher-bearers at Passchendaele, those early paramedics who laboured under the most dreadful conditions to rescue the dead and wounded."

    "description": "Do you worry about your daughters attitude & behaviour?\nDoes she strugle with a poor sense of self worth or fail to see her potential?\nDoes she lack courage, confidence & that spark she used to have?\nIs she obsessed with her phone, social media or other tech?\nDoes she struggle to suuround herself with friends who are good for her?\nOr are you just tired of repeating yourself over and over again only to get the same result, or even worse\u2026no response at all?\n\nIf you answered yes & can relate to some or maybe even all of these then a Savage Angels event is for you.\nSavage Angels is an event for girls aged 11-17 & their parents that's focused on Inspiring, Informing & Instructing them how to make smarter more informed decisions in life. We want to empower girls to hold core values that will allow them to stand strong in the face of social media & peer group influences. We know this event has the potential to make a huge difference in girls lives & their futures.\nOne of the biggest deficits seen in young people today is a lack of social & emotional intelligence. This can lead to a whole range of problems with their personal development at home, at school & with friends both on & off line.\nIt can put unnecessary strain on relationships with siblings & sometimes unsustainable pressure on parents. Leading to everything from arguements, fights, anxiety, stress & depression through to significant family breakdown.\nThe topics addressed at these events are all focused on personal development.\nThings like self-esteem, confidence, friendships & relationships, social media & mainstream media influence, anxiety, stress, depression, suicide, mindset, apathy, hope, dreams & the hard work required to kick arse in life.\nWhat parents are saying\n\nRyan & Torrey Hansel - Rev hit the nail right on the head with everything that was said at the Ipswich event we went to. We came for our girls but both of us parents walked away with just as much if not more than them. What was said about the value girls place on people they don't like or care about & what they say will stay with our younger daughter for life, she was so impressed with that simple concept that was taught. Thank you R, T, M15 & H12\n\nEle Hosie - Savage angel was such an awesome experience the story\u2019s where so real and it was incredibly inspirational and interesting to hear so many peoples stories I feel savage angel really shows you what people are going through and gives you a different perspective on things\n\nKirsten Webster - Thanks for a very powerful evening Rev. My 12year old daughter took a lot from the night and I have definitely noticed more peace, respect and contribution from her since! I also took a lot from it, I am absolutely stepping up my consistency with consequences. I highly recommend this to parents of girls who just need a little support with communication.\n\nLisa Short - Great evening, presentation was down to earth, related well to young audience. I recommend, certainly got nothing to lose so why not go along! it starts conversations.....\n\nSharon Baptist - The session was very open and honest and encouraging. A lot of the core values we had already discussed at home but hearing from Lana and Jo really impressed our girl!! An amazing night and I highly suggest going\n\nMelanie Nicholls - Well worth taking my daughter to this last night. Some very sad stories helped her to put her own life into perspective and she walked away being able to analise the values of true friendship. I\u2019m grateful that she could hear this talk at a young age. Thankyou.\n\nBelinda Marshall - Thank you so much to everyone involved in Savage Angel; tonight was fantastic! The speakers were so inspiring, all with different stories to tell. My 13yo daughter loved it and we will certainly be attending another event in the future.\n\nTaesha - Hi I\u2019m Taesha and I\u2019m using my mums phone I came to the first event tonight and it definitely has made me feel much braver and inspired me to push myself to be the best I can be. I\u2019m 10 years old and got a lot out of the event. Thanks for the savage angel cap and I will wear it proudly.\n\nDeborah Jean Scott - Wow what an awesome experience for both my girls 12 & 16. We all had tears in our eyes at different parts, even Dad. I can't recommend it more highly and would love to become involved with it, in some way. It will only keep going from strength to strength. Thank you all so much for sharing with us xxxx\n\nAll reviews are posted up exactly as we reicive them, to read more CLICK HERE\nOur ultimate goal is to influence millions of girls across the planet to blaze their own trail & to do it with a great sense of purpose. To do it like the Savage Angels we know they can become.\nWarning: These events are not for the politically correct because young people & parents don't think politically correctly when going through a tough time. We fully intend to say things that we know will challenge & upset both young people & parents so don't come along expecting it to be all marshmallows, unicorns & fairy dust because it will be anything but that. The message will be strong to both girls & their parents because that's how we get the results we do.\n\nPlease don't book in with a large group of friends, this is not another girls night out it's much more important than that. This is also not just a mother & daughter event, where possible try to come as a family even if you're separated & it's appropriate to do so.\nSo turn of the tech, screens & headsets they can do without TikTok, Insta & YouTube for 2hrs. Ignore the potential complaints & objections they wont resent you for bringing them, well not for very long.lol\nWe hope you can make it along to this very significant event.\nThe Savage Angel Team\n\nWhat about the boys & their parents?\nWe also have a boys event called Motov8ing Boys happening at the same location the night before at the same time.

    "description": "Parenting can be both a joy and very hard work.\nBut things get in the way of us being the parents we want to be - including our own thoughts and feelings. These can be about ourselves, about our children, about our parenting, or about what others think about our parenting.\nYour Parenting ACT is a 6 week course for parents of school aged children where you can develop a strong foundation for your parenting. It helps you understand your child, develop your self, nurture your relationship with your child and parent in line with your values. It uses principles from ACT \u2014 Acceptance and Commitment Training \u2014 to help you make room for all your thoughts and feelings, so you can respond more calmly and flexibly as a parent.\nACT uses acceptance, mindfulness and behavioural strategies to help people pursue what matters most to them, including being the parent they want to be.\nWe know that people wonder whether groups are for them! But we find that discovering ACT with and from people who are having similar experiences such as parenting, is very effective and fun. A recent attendee said:\n\"I can read all the books, but there's nothing like meeting and hearing from other parents.\"\n\n\nThe course is held over six consecutive Tuesday evenings from 7:00pm to 9:00pm.\nWe understand that sometimes things get in the way of plans, and occasionally people can't make a night of the course. But it is essential that you attend the first night of the course in order to take part in the remaining sessions. The course includes invitations to share and experiential exercises that work best when we are able to get to know one another and develop trust in the group.\n\nThis course needs a minimum number of parents to go ahead. So if you've decided to come, please sign up! It's very helpful to know that we have enough people to proceed.\n\n\nGiselle Bahr is a clinical psychologist working in Wellington who continues to parent two adult children. She works primarily with young people and their families in private practice. Before that she spent 15 years working in Wellington's public health system and teaching in a university clinical training programme.\nTania Stanton works as a clinical psychologist at the Maternal Mental Health Service. She has previously worked in Infant, Child, Adolescent and Family Services where she co-developed and facilitated therapy groups for young people and their parents using ACT. She is enthusiastic about the help that ACT can offer to enhance people\u2019s lives."
