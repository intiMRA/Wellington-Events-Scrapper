      "description": "Anthony Donaldson is one of this country's great drummers a pioneer of improvised music in Aotearoa.\nA visual artist before becoming a musician, Anthony's starting point on the drums was in finding tonal colours, rhythms that come from nature, and constructing a drum kit that grew like a living sculpture, Beginning in the late 70s and early 80s with Primitive Art Group, his music making has always centred on free improvisation and collective composition.\nHis musical journey has seen him perform with countless ensembles, often of his own creation, including the Black Sheep, Six Volts, Razorblades, Mean Bones, Flower Orphans, Teeth, Devils Gate Outfit, Rubbernecks, Farewell Spit, Melancholy Babes and the Stinging Nettles.\nHe has been a creative force in Wellington music for over four decades and continues to push the boundaries of accepted musical norms, while encouraging and mentoring younger players.\nFor the first of his two night performance residency Anthony will be performing solo and in collaboration with: trio with Nell Thomas (electronics) / David Long (guitar) trio with David Donaldson (bass banjo) / Steve Roche (brass) trio with Jonny Marks (Synthi AKS) / Daniel Beban (reel-to-reel) Listen here to a recent Dancing in Your Head podcast featuring Anthony playing some of his own music and tracks which he's been listening to."

      "description": "Nick is a musician and Mindful Somatic therapist based in Wellington and has been putting on gong baths throughout Wellington and more recently in Kapiti.\nThe session has been crafted musically, leaning on deep drones from Paiste gongs and other instruments that harmonize together in layers, rather than loud, crashing strikes of the gong.\nNick considers the nervous system throughout, giving you an experience of 'dropping' into deeper brainwave states through the form and gentle introduction.\nThe sound of the session is more like contemporary ambient music using acoustic instruments than traditional Eastern music, and positive feedback has included: feeling extremely relaxed, to having psychedelic imagery, to processing old memories.\nYou never know what might happen, so its about just being open to the experience."

      "description": "Raising Great Kids in an Overindulgent World This workshop will be a confronting one that will expose you to the risks that children face in this modern overindulgent world.\nMany have become used to being the constant centre of attention and are unable to delay gratification and aren\u2019t competent in everyday skills.\nThey have few self-care skills and skills relating to others, can\u2019t take personal responsibility and don\u2019t know what is enough or what is \u201cnormal\u201d for others \u2013 these children end up having a difficult time of it in life and you will too.\nYou\u2019ll take away new insight and knowledge plus strategies that you can apply that very night to help your child to be a responsible, likeable and respectful person.\nNote:  Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel."
