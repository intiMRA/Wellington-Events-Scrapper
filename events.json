Its return 34 years later at the 2026 festival is highly anticipated. It has become a landmark piece of New Zealand theatre \u2014 exploring the tension between past and future. Set in the summer of 1965, the play follows Hone, who brings his family from New Zealand\u2019s East Cape to the South Island in search of a better life. As they gather for a beachside birthday h\u0101ng\u012b with their P\u0101keh\u0101 guests, buried secrets and cultural tensions rise to the surface. Far from their  t\u012bpuna , the family must navigate questions of identity, belonging, and survival. \nWaiora Te \u016akaip\u014d was conceived, written and directed by Hone Kouka (Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101ti Raukawa, Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu). The multi-award-winning writer/director has penned 13 plays. Many have been staged in Aotearoa and further afield in Canada, South Africa, New Caledonia, and the UK. Waiora Te \u016akaip\u014d is presented in partnership with the Aotearoa New Zealand Festival of the Arts, Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, Auckland Theatre Company and Tawata Productions.",

    "long_description": "It\u2019s Westerberg High, where popularity is a matter of life and death. Welcome to \u2018Heathers the Musical\u201d. Based on a movie with the same name, the show is a coming-of-age story dealing with love, heartache, defying expectations, and being true to yourself. It originally premiered in Los Angeles in 2013. Since then, the musical has had record-breaking seasons across the globe. It now makes its professional New Zealand debut in 2026, and Wellington is in line to join the school assembly. Described as a high-octane, black comedy rock musical, Heathers is packed with a mix of ballads and showstoppers. The catchy tunes are written by Kevin Murphy (Desperate Housewives) and Laurence O\u2019Keefe (Legally Blonde: The Musical). \nThe 1989 film starred Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. It quickly achieved cult status among audiences. Both the movie and musical follow high school student Veronica Sawyer. Veronica is just another nobody until she\u2019s unexpectedly taken under the wings of the beautiful and cruel Heathers. When mysterious teen rebel J.D. arrives, Veronica learns that it might kill to be a nobody, but it's murder being a somebody. \nThis special production will feature a stellar Australasian cast. So grab your scrunchies, break out the Corn Nuts and wait for the bell to ring.",

    "long_description": "What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

    "long_description": "\u2018Animals first entered the imagination as messengers and promises,\u2019 John Berger.\nMessengers explores the enduring gaze shared between humans and other animals. The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

The day is always the best of laid-back Kiwi style, very relaxed and friendly, with of course the true Welsh Christmas spirit and hospitality that you know and love.\n\nIf you make the good list there will be a visit from Santa too. We organise a Secret Santa present swap, presided over by the big man himself \u2013 our guidelines are a $10 op shop gift so let your imagination run wild.\n\nThe day begins at 2pm with a welcome drink, and food served from 2.30pm.\n\nThis event tends to sell out quickly, so early booking is definitely recommended.\n\nThe dress code is dress to impress \u2013 whatever that means to you. Three-piece dinner suit? Christmas t-shirt? Elf costume? Whatever makes you feel fabulously festive.\nWe can\u2019t wait to see you there. And from all of us at the Dragon, Nadolig Llawen!\n\n**Full price is $115. This includes your welcome drink, a delicious 5-course Christmas feast, all whilst enjoying the day's festivities exclusively in our pub.**\n\n",

The day is always the best of laid-back Kiwi style, very relaxed and friendly, with of course the true Welsh Christmas spirit and hospitality that you know and love.\nIf you make the good list there will be a visit from Santa too. We organise a Secret Santa present swap, presided over by the big man himself \u2013 our guidelines are a $10 op shop gift so let your imagination run wild.\nThe day begins at 2pm with a welcome drink, and food served from 2.30pm.\nThis event tends to sell out quickly, so early booking is definitely recommended.\nThe dress code is dress to impress \u2013 whatever that means to you. Three-piece dinner suit? Christmas t-shirt? Elf costume? Whatever makes you feel fabulously festive.\nWe can\u2019t wait to see you there. And from all of us at the Dragon, Nadolig Llawen!\n**Full price is $115.

This young and exciting group creates a sound that is full of energy & innovation, whilst all the time remaining true to their traditional roots.\n\n\u201cShenanigans was THE breakout band at the Gardens Magic in Wellington NZ\".Their energy was infectious and the crowd response was incredible. They were able to connect to all ages, from Mohawked teenagers, to their grandparents. I had heard good things about them, but the musicianship, and stage presence playing live exceeded every expectation I had.\u201d \u2013 Alan Thompson Director of Irish music Appreciation society 2013.\n\nShenanigans garnered much critical acclaim in recent years, even being compared to super groups such as by respected New Zealand Musician Magazine. Their meteoric rise in the music world was given a massive boost in 2011 when they were released their album Live 2005!. Shenanigans subsequently went on to receive the \u201cBest live act on the Good Morning show\u201d from well-respected Tv Presenter and were also named \u201cBest Jokers\u201d at The New Zealand Jokers Awards in 2012.\n\nFollowing the tremendous success of their debut album \u201cballyscullymuckery\u201d, the group\u2019s profile was further raised with the release of their follow up title, \u201cLive in your Lounge\u201d in 2018.Nz Musician Magazine described it as having \u201cso many good tracks, so much energy, a band in full control and having such fun yet well able to bring things down to a tearful pause\u201d. Most recently Shenanigans was awarded \u201cTop Band of few\u201d by the a guy down the pub.\n\n\nShenanigans is one of New Zealand's hottest bands. Specializing in elegant live preformances, Shenanigans is the perfect choice for your event. Although based in Wellington, we perform regularly throughout the country; including Auckland, Christchurch, and Masterton. Shenanigans is a band seriously worth considering for the best possible wedding music that inspires non-stop dancing. In addition to weddings, we often play at charity events, corporate functions, catered affairs, and private parties. Shenanigans plays the best dance music ever written from the 1930's - present, which includes Irish Classics, Country, Rock-n-Roll, Ethnic, Group Participation, and much more. In addition, we keep our repertoire as cool as we can by constantly learning everyone's favourite songs. This hardworking Wellington wedding band spends a tremendous amount of time learning, reviewing, and ultimately perfecting the music required for each engagement. We play everything live without the artificial computerized support that most of our competitors rely on these days. You will notice that Shenanigans performs every song with a celtic fun twist. There is no better choice for wedding music.",

After years of smash hit, full houses all accross Aotearoa, the boys are hitting the Rogue and Vagabone to shake things up, BIG time!\n\nDid we mention the special guests' Not just guests, special guests!

Fullas, you might find a pretty lady in the crowd' Ladies, you might get yourself a cashed-up musician (get in quick -they're flying out the door!)\n\nWhatever happens, it will be hearty good times.\n\nThe band has its roots firmly embedded in the traditions of Jamaican rocksteady, ska and reggae music and is further nourished by its connection with its community. They will be spreading this love on their South Island tour in January 2026.\n\nBe sure to bring your dancing shoes for one of Wellington\u2019s biggest, best-loved, longest-running and grooviest vintage reggae bands: Newtown Rocksteady!\n\nPossibly one of the greatest dance bands to have played the Mussel Inn in the past eighteen years. These guys are rock steady in every sense of those two words.\n- Andrew, Mussel Inn - Takaka\n\nI love it when I go to a concert expecting to see my favourite band and discover that the openers are almost better than the headline act. Numbering twelve on the stage, Newtown Rocksteady damn near threatened to demolish the stage by sheer force of numbers!\n\nThese guys are hard-hitting aficionados of \u201870s dub classics as per Lee Scratch Perry and Augustus Pablo, and their particular delivery quickly fuel up the lukewarm Sunday audience. Story goes that the Black Seeds caught their act at the recent Newtown Festival and were so taken they asked them to open for their Wellington homecoming gigs.\n\nI can see why. Big horns, smatterings of conscious roots, deep, soulful grooves \u2013 tunes are well crafted, a little righteous but, ultimately, perfect to wiggle to. Special mention goes to \u2018So Long\u2019, with brilliant lines \u201coil on the water \u2013 pain in my soul\u201d \u2013 a reference to BP, oil slicks, Nigeria and the evils of the oil industry.\n\n",

The upcoming world tour will mark Shai Hulud\u2019s first extended run of shows in over a decade, featuring van der Velde on vocals.\nThe Furnace Fest performance was a monumental moment in the band\u2019s history, bringing together, for the first time since 2004, the full lineup that recorded the landmark 2003 album That Within Blood Ill-Tempered. For many fans, it was the first chance to see van der Velde back on the mic, and he did not disappoint. If anything, his vocals have grown stronger and even more ferocious with time, while the chemistry on stage was undeniable, a testament to the band\u2019s enduring spirit and technical mastery. Fans and newcomers alike were left buzzing about the energy, emotion, and sheer force of the performance.\nWhile the upcoming world tour will feature Shai Huluds current lineup, van der Velde will helm vocal duties for all shows, delivering performances that span the band\u2019s celebrated catalog, including a spotlight on tracks from That Within Blood Ill-Tempered.\nShai Hulud is back.

Playing fan favourites like The Pot, Stinkfist, Forty Six & 2 and others, it\u2019s the perfect way to get your Tool fix whether you saw them in Auckland or didn't get the chance! It might seem crazy to run a tribute to the greats a couple of months after the legends themselves are here but these lads are a bit mad and they bring that energy to every show!\n\nInsecure Delusion: A Tribute To Tool take the stage with energy and passion for the genres and the musicianship that Tool is known for. An event not to be missed if you're a Tool fiend.\n\nAnd just to make the night extra special, our friends from Down With The System will be opening with a killer set from the legends that are SOAD!\n\nEarlybirds are available now but only for a limited ticket run! At only $25 per ticket (+ bf), your bank account will be thanking you. \ud83e\udd18\n\n\"I\u2019ve had the chance to see this band twice in Napier. They\u2019re absolutely in keeping with Tool, powerful vocals, a fantastic drummer, and an all-round tight, talented group of guys. Great energy, great music, and genuinely good people.\" Rion R\n\n\"I was completely blown away by the tightness and musicality of these guys. All showcased amazing versatility on their chosen instruments. Would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates quality music. Thanks for an entertaining evening. Smashed it out of the park! \" Micheal D\n\n\nPlease note: San Fran has a Supervised Licence meaning under 18s are welcome as long as they are supervised by a responsible adult (usually mum or dad).\n\n",

    "long_description": "Summer singing retreat\nStart the new year with intention in a fun and inclusive environment. The beginning of the year is a perfect time to get together and feel the power of community and connection through singing.\n\nSing for renewal and hope. Sing for harmony, joy, and inspiration. Sing for healing. Sing to regain your strength and empower others.\n\nSpend the 2 days encircled by a community of like-minded people and focusing on your well-being through singing. Rest, connect, and restore. The weekend is carefully planned so there is plenty of time to sing and to rest in between.\n\nWe will breathe together, listen, create beautiful sounds, let go of our worries, and lift each other to a sense of fulfilment and joy. And to make the event even more special, Lala will be cooking an authentic Malagasy dinner on Saturday night (an experience not to be missed).\n\nJonathan Berkahn and Lala Simpson have led workshops and performed together for many years. They are both highly skilled song leaders who lead from the heart and joyfully share their gifts. You will be in safe hands. ALL SINGERS OF ALL LEVELS OF ABILITY ARE WELCOME!!!\n\nJonathan will teach a mix of pop, folk and original songs, and Lala will teach a mix of songs from South Africa, Georgia, Madagascar and community songs.\n\nIf you are coming from out of town, the Home of Compassion offers some accommodation with reasonable rates which includes breakfast. Please contact them directly to enquire at\n\nREGISTRATION: Get tickets on Humanitix, or if you want to avoid the extra fees, register here\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nSaturday, 17th of January: This first part of the retreat will be held at the Island Bay Presbyterian Church. We will spend the day singing in the beautiful auditorium and share a Malagasy meal cooked by Lala at the end of the day. Morning tea, afternoon tea, and dinner provided. Please BYO lunch. The beach is close by, so bring your swimming gear for a dip at lunchtime.\n\nSunday, 18th of January: We will be singing in the Lyon Room (large meeting room filled with natural light) at the Home of Compassion in Island Bay. We will finish the day singing the songs we learnt at a FREE community concert in the Chapel. Morning tea, afternoon tea, and lunch provided.\n\nThe Island Bay Presbyterian Church and the Home of Compassion are within walking distance of each other.\n\n",

The last one we had at Battle Hill was so nice and we met so many new people. Noting that this is weather dependent.\n\nWhere:\nWe have secured \"The Dell\" area for semi-exclusive use at Battle Hill. (It will be Wellington Anniversary weekend so may be a bit busy.) This means a large section of grass with trees, toilets and the river close by for the kids to play in and see the eels and we can braai in webers, etc. The bigger kids that want to go and swim in the hole can take a walk there. Unfortunately, there are no concrete slabs that we can make fires on so you will need to bring a braai with.\n\nWhat to bring?\nWell, this is not a catered place so you will need to bring the following:\nGazebo\nChairs and/or blankets\nBraai and charcoal/wood i.e. weber, etc \ud83d\ude09\nThere are gas braais as well but you will need to share it with the rest of the people / campers.)\nMeat, drinks, salad and water/ drinks (to drink and to K*ll your fire with)\nBalls, bats, etc for the kids to play (If someone is keen on arranging games for the day, we would appreciate it!)\n\nThere is no cost to us getting semi exclusive use of the area. However, if you want to extend the night and camp, you will need to pay for that.\n\nPlease note that this is a working farm area and unfortunately no dogs are allowed AT ALL.\n\nAlso note that the gates are locked at 8pm so if you are not camping, please keep this in mind so you can get out in time.\n\nThis is an open invitation so no need to RSVP to me but it would be nice to have an indication on how many people will attend by confirming on the event \"Going\" or \"Interested\".\n\nI hope to see LOTS of you there!\n\n",

    "long_description": "Beoga\nAcclaimed Irish band Beoga will make their long-awaited return to New Zealand in January 2026, performing two intimate headline shows in Auckland and Wellington.\n\nKnown for their adventurous spirit and willingness to chart new musical territory, Beoga have redefined the possibilities of Irish traditional music. Their global reach was cemented through collaborations with Ed Sheeran on the record-breaking \u00f7 (Divide) album, including the smash hits \u201cGalway Girl\u201d and \u201cNancy Mulligan.\u201d The former has now surpassed 1.4 billion streams on Spotify alone.\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus from touring and releasing music, Beoga made a powerful comeback earlier this year with their new album Phases, released in June.

    "long_description": "Wilson Blackley The Remain Tour with Oscar LaDell.\nWilson Blackley is an Australian multi-instrumentalist and producer currently based in Melbourne.\nBorn and raised in Poowong (Victoria), Wilson was surrounded by music from an early age. At just 2 years old he started playing the drums along to his mother\u2019s music collection consisting of old soul, funk and r&b from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. He started learning the guitar as soon as he could, and had the habit of making anything he could get his hands on into an instrument. Growing up far from the city instilled a strong sense of curiosity and work ethic in him from a young age, leading him to produce his first batch of demos in his teenage years. A stand-out among these demos was the song \u2018Home\u2019\n\u2018Home\u2019 found its way to Sam Teskey (The Teskey Brothers) who would go on to co-produce the song alongside Wilson when he was just 18.\nFollowing the release of \u2018Home\u2019, he went on to sell out The Gasometer and play a string of festival slots alongside a variety of artists including The Teskey Brothers and Boy and Bear.\nAt this time, Wilson moved to St Kilda and in the heart of Melbourne began collaborating with Sensible J (Sampa The Great, Remi, Immy Owusu) on his debut EP \u2018Material Plane P1\u2019 which was released to critical acclaim in August 2022. After that, he co-produced Oscar LaDell\u2019s EP \u2018No Blue\u2019 and subsequently embarked on a co-headline tour of Aotearoa and Australia with LaDell. After a three year break from releasing music, Wilson Blackley will return with his new song \u2018Wired\u2019 that bridges the sonics from his first EP with what's to come.\nAlso appearing Oscar LaDell hot off a US tour.\nDoors open 8pm for an 8.30pm start.",

This is a special time in the History of Creation that so many seekers have been born on this Earth. They have realized that there is something beyond than the mundane life they have to seek. This is not the seeking of one life. It is the seeking of ages which is being prophesied, has to be fulfilled now. There have been prophesies and prophesies about this great time. In India about 14,000 years back, Brigu Muni has written a book called Nadi Grant in which He has described you all saying that a day that will come when all these greater seekers, great seekers will be born on this Earth and that their Kundalini which is the Power of their True Desire will be awakened spontaneously and they\u2019ll find out what they are.\n\nBut also there has been prophesies about many fake people coming on this Earth and they will try to delude and take people away from the truth.\n\nThere have been also great prophesies all over the world but especially in England about hundred years back a great poet called William Blake was born and He has written so clearly, so clearly about Sahaja Yoga that it is surprising how He has even exactly mentioned the house where I\u2019ll be staying. Also that he has said that the men of God, meaning the seekers, the men of God will become prophets and they will have the power to make others prophets. This is the sign we should take when we are seeking the truth.\n- Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi (Founder - Sahaja Yoga Meditation)\nBring in your friends and families too to this course :)\n#meditation #21 Day meditation # Sahaja Yoga #meditate #guided_meditation #classess #online #online_event #online_classes #online_meditation #yoga #online_meditation_class #meditation_class #meditation_course #peace #yoga_day#online_meditation_course #sahaja_yoga #spirituality #Yoga #kundalini #chakra #nadi #nirvicharita #workshop #seminar #spiritual_awakening#self_development #self_improvement #google #eventbrite #kundalini_activation #healing #kundalini_yoga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:45 PM - 03:00 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f Introduction & Recap\nInfo: If you missed the initial session, you are provided a one-on-one session in a breakout room to get you up to speed\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:00 PM - 03:30 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f Guided Meditation\nInfo: \u2744\ufe0f\u26c5Water, light, fire, sky, ground and other elements will be used to enhance the power of meditation and internal cleansing\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:30 PM - 03:45 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f One-to-one session (Optional)\nInfo: On-demand revision, healing, spiritual talks, technique practice, and more...\n\n\n\n",

There\u2019s no expectation to speak \u2014 your presence alone is valued. The circle follows a respectful, non-judgmental format, prioritizing safety, confidentiality, and authenticity.\nOptional Plant-Based Dinner\nAfter the circle, stay for a wholesome plant-based dinner and dessert ($15). Sharing a meal is a simple way to extend the sense of community and connection. This gathering is offered on a non-profit basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us after this free event for an optional plant-based dinner and dessert for only $15 (or $5 for students).\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. Over the years, Andre has come to value the power of sitting in circle\u2014of men coming together in honesty, vulnerability, and presence to witness and support one another. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:00 PM - 06:15 PM\nArrive to Bhakti Lounge\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 06:15 PM - 07:15 PM\nMen's Circle: Authentic Relating\nHost: Andre\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 07:15 PM - 08:15 PM\nOptional Plant-based dinner and dessert!\n\n\n",

The focus is on camping, coffee, and having a fun time with relatively short kayaking times on the water.\n\nThe schedule for Wellingtonians is: on the Thursday 29th Ferry over to Picton, in at 12:30, launch from Picton beach head over to Kumoto, tents up, Friday - paddle around the Bay of Many Coves, stop for coffee / lunch / chips / shower at Punga Cove, stay at Camp Bay. Maybe a quick trip over to Bumine Island with empty boats. Saturday night at Ratimira for camping / snoozing. Sunday - up early, on water at 8am, paddle back to Picton in by 12, lunch, on 1pm sailing. So 4 days with Blumine as an optional paddle, mostly shortish trips. We might shift the plan around depending on the weather, but that sets out the general plan.\n\nFor the ferry you need to book your own tickets and I would urge you to get your ferry tickets now as they go fast. If you are concerned about the weather get the fully refundable tickets. When you buy your ticket select the \"kayak\" option. Any questions ask them in the comments below.\n\nAlso check out other Trips & Adventurous Activities in Wellington.",

    "long_description": "SUMAC - WELLINGTON - VALHALLAH\nBanished Music, Whammy Bar, and Valhalla are proud to present the long-awaited New Zealand debut of experimental post-metal trio SUMAC.\nFormed in 2014, the powerhouse trio comprised of Aaron Turner (guitar, vocals; Isis, Old Man Gloom), Brian Cook (bass; Russian Circles, Botch), and Nick Yacyshyn (drums; Baptists) are renowned for merging crushing heaviness with improvisational freedom, exploring the boundaries between structure and chaos.\n\nSUMAC have built a reputation as a fearsome live band. Visceral and cathartic shows where crushing riffs & sprawling drones collide with extended bursts of wild improvisation. In 2024, the band released their critically acclaimed album The Healer, a sweeping, transformative work spanning four monumental tracks. The record dives deep into themes of regeneration, suffering, and spiritual reconstruction \u2014 a testament to the band\u2019s ability to meld raw power with emotional depth.\n\nThe experimental metal trio\u2019s four-song, 76-minute album is the peak of their career. It\u2019s dense and invigorating, highlighting the band\u2019s dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. - Pitchfork\n\nSoon after the release SUMAC teamed up with poet and sound artist Moor Mother to release The Film, a boundary-pushing collaborative album. Released via Thrill Jockey in April 2025, the record unfolds as a cinematic journey across eight \u201cscenes,\u201d merging SUMAC\u2019s heavy, jazz-inflected textures with Moor Mother\u2019s incisive spoken-word commentary.\n\nSUMAC\u2019s work has always been about transition between different states of being. Our sense of normal, and indeed our sense of life, is now being shaken. We don\u2019t know what is coming next. We are looking for pointers towards the future, as well as things to hold onto in the moment.\nNew Zealanders, don\u2019t miss this rare and powerful journey into uncharted sonic terrain.\n\n",

After a stop in Palmerston North we head up the trunk through the townships of Feilding and Marton before turning onto the Marton - New Plymouth railway line for the last stretch into Whanganui. After crossing the 290km long Whanganui River, we proceed slowly down the short 5km branch line taking us to Taupo Quay.\n\nTRAVEL ON THE PADDLE STEAMER WAIMARIE!\nSalvaged from the bottom of the Whanganui River where she sat for around 50 years, the Paddle Steamer Waimarie was restored to her former glory and re-launched in 2000. She is now the only one of her kind in operation in New Zealand. Your cruise leaves the Riverboat Centre Wharf and heads upriver taking in the scenery and views of Whanganui which can only be experienced from Te Awa Tupua, the Whanganui River. The commentary shares riverboat history and points of interest along the way. Check out the boiler that powers our paddle steamer, and maybe meet the homing pigeons and send a message with them on their flight back to the Riverboat Centre.\n\nDeparting Paekakariki/Paraparaumu/Waikanae/Otaki/Levin\nAdult 13+ yrs - $209\nChild 2-12yrs - $179\n\nDeparting Palmerston North/Feilding\nAdult 13+ yrs - $189\nChild 2-12yrs - $169\n\nBuses will transport you from your arrival at the station to the Waimarie River Boat Centre.\n\nDO YOUR OWN THING!\nThere will be a collection of vintage cruiser bikes for hire for a small fee to those keen to take exploring to the next level.\n\nThere will be short tours available at the Durie Hill Elevator. It is New Zealand\u2019s only public transport elevator and is still used on a daily basis by locals and visitors.\n\nThere are multiple places to go, and things to see on a cruiser bike or on foot. Take a tram ride for a small fee and arrive at the Riverboat museum, be blown away by NZ Glassworks, admire the sculptures and views from the Motua gardens along the river, indulge in local cuisine, or simply shop local.\n\nDeparting Paekakariki/Paraparaumu/Waikanae/Otaki/Levin\nAdult 13+ yrs - $159\nChild 2-12yrs - $139\n\nDeparting Palmerston North/Feilding\nAdult 13+ yrs - $139\nChild 2-12yrs - $119\n\nBook at https://steaminc.org.nz/book-train-trip/river-city-express/\n\n",

    "long_description": "UNLEASH THE VOICES OF YOUR SUN AND MOON\nBook Soon for this special day workshop and explore and unleash the power of your Voice and Astrological Archetypes!!\n\nWe are blessed that Alignment Coach and Healer, Clare Babbage is visiting the Wellington Region from Napier, and collaborating with Voice Empowerment Coach and Healer, Bryony Rogers from Heartsong Healing, in this exciting, unique offering.\n\nThis workshop is a specially designed, transformative full day experience of Embodied Astrological Archetypes and Conscious Sound and Voice Practices.\n\nBOOK HERE - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nOn the date of the full moon, the energies of the sun and the moon stand face to face \u2014 illuminating both our outer expression and our inner world.\n\nIn astrology, the sun represents our fullest expression, our vitality, and the way we are here to shine. The moon reveals our emotional landscape, our inner rhythms, and often the fears that arise when we dare to live that full expression. Together, they form a powerful dialogue between structure and flow, logic and emotion, masculine and feminine.\n\nIn this workshop, Clare will guide you into an embodied exploration of your own sun and moon, inviting you to feel these two archetypes within your body and notice where they support, resist, or balance each other.\n\nBryony will lead you into vocal practices that bring these energies into sound and voice \u2014 giving expression to what is often left unspoken. Through voice, you\u2019ll release what holds you back and discover new harmony between your inner and outer selves.\n\nThis full moon is the perfect moment to unleash the voices of your sun and moon \u2014 and to step more fully into clarity, balance, and authentic expression.\n\nThe timing of this workshop gives you a unique opportunity to tune into these planets and benefit from their placement in the collective astrology.\n\nThe workshop will begin with the opportunity to explore powerful, enjoyable, accessible Voice Practices which open, align and strengthen your expression - and create physiological changes in your energy field.\n\nWe will then directly, bodily experience the energies of each of the Celestial Bodies through Embodied Astrology, guided by Clare.\n\nWe will integrate these energies, through further Voice Practices, including improvisation, healing chants and songs.\n\nThese two modalities will be carefully interwoven in an enjoyable, rich day's workshop that will benefit all participants.\n\nThere will be guided space in the workshop to integrate the energetic shifts and discoveries of both the Voice Practices and the Astrology.\n\nThis special workshop takes place on Saturday February 7th, 10am-4.30pm - we hope you can join us\n\nAt the Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Paraparaumu.\n\nINVESTMENT:\n\nYour investment for this day is $233. Shared lunch.\nSome concessions are available - please contact us by email .\n\nPayment by card here - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nPlease contact us with any questions at all.\n\n",

    "long_description": "On the 12 February 1909, the SS Penguin sank in Cook Strait in a raging southerly storm with the loss of 72 lives, one of the worst maritime disasters in NZ history.  Many of those who died were woman and children, as their lifeboats capsized in the wild sea. \nAlthough the Captain was heavily criticised, it is still not clear what the ship hit nor where, as the wreck of the Penguin has never been located. \nThe tragedy stunned Wellington and a day of mourning was called for 16 February.  The city came to a standstill as many of those who died were brought up to Karori Cemetery for burial in a long procession of cabs and lorries.\nTo commemorate this tragedy the Friends will be undertaking a guided tour of most of the Penguin graves on Sunday 8th February. \nThe tour duration is approximately 2 hours long.\nThis tour is suitable for people with moderate fitness. The route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. Surefootedness is required.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee). Children under 12 are free.\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nNote:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you one hour before the tour start time by email and on our Facebook page. The booking fee is non-refundable.\nPlease dress appropriately for the conditions. While we do our best to guide you on a safe walking route, during the winter months the ground can become slippery in places.\nSome of our walks require a moderate degree of fitness and are not suited for those with limited mobility. Please read the tour descriptions carefully to check that they will be suitable for you.\nThere is only one toilet which is located by the cemetery office at the main entrance.\nPlease meet us at the shelter (shown as the Historic Chapel on the map at the main entrance)\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Karori Cemetery.",

Whilst RateYourMusic users described the album as \u201chedonistic, energetic, vulgar, rhythmic, urban, and heavy,\u201d capturing the raw essence of its sound and attitude. With over 450,000 copies sold worldwide, Broke remains a defining moment in the nu-metal era and this tour is your chance to relive it live.\n\nExpect pounding riffs, funk-infused grooves, and the unmistakable flow of frontman Jahred Gomes, whose stage presence turns every show into a riotous celebration of rebellion and rhythm. From their self-titled debut in 1997 to their latest release New and Improved, (HED) P.E. continues to evolve while staying true to their anti-establishment roots.\n\nDebuting in New Zealand for the first time and with an incredible career spanning nearly three decades, Nonpoint has long been a force to be reckoned with in the nu-metal/rap-rock genre. Known for legendary live performances and explosive tracks such as Bullet with a Name, What a Day, Ruthless, and more, the band has consistently captivated audiences with infectious riffs, compelling lyrics, and an uncompromising raw energy. Their discography and stagecraft have made them staples at rock radio and fixtures on festival lineups, earning them a dedicated international following.\n\nThis is not nostalgia, it\u2019s a full-blown sonic nu-metal assault. Don\u2019t miss (HED) P.E. and NONPOINT as they rip through Australia with setlists that traverse decades, defy genres, and unleash pure, unfiltered chaos!\n\n",

    "long_description": "STEAMS is an integrated approach to learning topics of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths, and Society that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. Its aim is to teach real world skills through engaging methods whilst allowing individuals to be creative. This involves immersing tamariki into projects and activities that develop innovation and champion curiosity. STEAMS is not \u2018play based learning\u2019 but focused learning through an integrated hands-on approach allowing children to take risks and explore their own curiosity in a subject without time barriers.\nAt the Ministry of Inspiration we offer STEAMS learning each term for Year 1-8 students. Once a week students will attend a class at Waterlea Racecourse, Blenheim on TUESDAY or THURSDAY. STEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) start at 9am and finish at 2:45pm on TUESDAY. Little STEAMerS operates from 9-12 on THURSDAY. STEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) operates on THURSDAY from 9am to 245 pm. \nInquiry, collaboration, and an emphasis on process-based learning are at the heart of the STEAM approach. Each term the classes will have a focus which drives the learning and our amazing teachers create opportunities to help each student develop their understanding, improve their skills and gain knowledge in a range of topics.\nStudents who participate in STEAM learning:\n\u00b7 think outside the box\n\u00b7 feel safe to express innovative and creative ideas\n\u00b7 feel comfortable doing hands-on learning\n\u00b7 take ownership over their learning\n\u00b7 work collaboratively with others\n\u00b7 understand the ways that science, maths, the arts, and technology work together\n\u00b7 become increasingly curious about the world around them and feel empowered to change it for the better.\nWhen does it meet, and where?\nThe school is held during school terms.\nSTEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) TUESDAY, 9-245.\nSTEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) THURSDAY, 9-245\nLittle STEAMerS (ages 5-6) THURSDAY 12-3.\nLocation:  Waterlea Racecourse, enter off of Linton St.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe students come for a paid three-week trial-as a new student you pay for that through Humanitix.\nIf both family and teacher feel there is a good fit for the child in the class, they continue for the rest of the term. You are then invoiced for the full term less the amount paid for the Trial.\nPayment is by term, with a cost of $73 incl. GST We have a limited number of scholarships available that are awarded on a term by term basis for those with financial need for 25% off. \nLittle STEAMerS is $30 incl. GST.\nWill my child\u2019s school mind that they miss a day per week?\nYou will need to inform the child\u2019s school that he or she will be at STEAMS School one day per week. To date we have not encountered any issues around accommodating a child\u2019s participation in STEAMS School, and many of the region\u2019s schools are very supportive of the programme. Once enrolled, you are encouraged to inform the teacher and office staff that your child should be marked present for the day they attend STEAMS School, as they will be attending an academic school as opposed to being absent due to illness or other reasons.",

    "long_description": "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention initially developed for emotional disorders. It is now widely used in supporting people to deal with the challenges of physical ill-health. Professionals from various backgrounds can learn to use a simplified CBT skills set, and use of these skills enables them to be more effective in managing aspects of their patients\u2019 distress.\nThe training is a mix of theory, skills demonstration and skills practice, giving participants a better understanding of the applicability of the skill set in their area of practice and providing some skills to take away. Training sessions are spaced to allow participants to use their new skills in their clinical practice. Each participant reflects on their learning and their work with a specific patient, and the whole group reflects on lessons learned. In this way, learning remains rooted in participants\u2019 clinical practice. These CBT courses are consistently evaluated highly by participants.\nThe Course\nTeaching will be commenced with 2 days of in person sessions. 19th and 20th Feb 2026 at Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington and subsequently 2 sessions on-line via Zoom. These will be either 18th or 19th March an 22nd or 23rd April 2026.\nAttendance at all sessions is mandatory to complete the course.\nThe courses cost is $850 per person (incl GST).\nThe Trainers\nKathy Burn was a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Palliative Care who went on to train in CBT and to develop the CBT service at St Christopher\u2019s Hospice, London. She now works in CBT in chronic pain, and she teaches and supervises CBT trainees at the institute of Psychiatry, London.\nKathryn Mannix was a Palliative Medicine Consultant and CBT therapist. She developed \u2018CBT First Aid\u2019 to enable palliative care clinicians to adapt skills from CBT into their clinical practice. She is an author. There are insights into her use of CBT in her books With the End in Mind and Listen.\nTerms and Conditions\nAttendance: In order to create a learning community for each course, it is important that each person on a course attends every session and is able to join in the discussions by keeping up with the course. By accepting a place on a particular course, you agree to attend all the sessions, to arrive on time, and to work alongside your group members during the session to support each other's learning. Each session builds on the last, and you'll be asked to put your new learning into practice in- between sessions. Building learning groups in this way means we can't add new trainees after a course has begun.\nWe are not able to run catch-up sessions for sessions missed. If you miss sessions, you may be asked to withdraw from the course and no refunds will be given.\nRefunds/Canellations: Once you sign up and pay, we won't be able to refund your payment unless we can reallocate your place to another person before the course begins. The deadline for cancelling your place is 28 days before the day and time of the first session. If you cancel and we can fill your place with another person, we'll offer you the choice of a refund or a place on a future course, if places are available. We will do our best to fill your place, but we can't promise this.

    "long_description": "USUI REIKI LEVEL TWO IN KAPITI with Heartsong\nLevel Two Usui Reiki is a significant development on from Level One. Get in touch to enquire. You can study Level Two with me if you had your Level One attunement elsewhere.\n\nThis TWO DAY course offers 10 hours of in person training, a full manual, certificate of completion, a follow up Zoom call and ongoing support. Maximum of 6 participants to enable close support and interaction.\n\nLevel 2 involves a new powerful attunement and learning new techniques such as Distance Reiki, sacred reiki symbols, and preparing for working on people you may not know. You can start charging for your Reiki services after completing level two.\n\nWe learn about three Reiki symbols and practice drawing them. By Day 2 it is expected that you have memorized how to draw Level 2 Symbols (I teach with a gap between day 1&2 so this is very achievable).\n\nBecoming competent at distance healing is a significant priority of Level 2 training and we will have plenty of practice doing this. Distance healing is practiced on people and animals. Basic business set up is discussed.\n\nAdvanced Practitioner Level Reiki is a great tool if you want to feel centered in your life, it helps to balance and align our energy bodies, and can cause positive changes in many areas of our lives. Reiki can be used to help heal a wide number of conditions and to initiate and support positive life changes. Further details on enquiry. Reiki Level 2 opens you to a deeper channel of healing energy and enables you to offer healing professionally.\n\nDates are specially chosen to be auspicious in relation to the moon and cosmic energies\n\nSaturday FEBRUARY 21ST, 10.am-4.30pm\n\nSaturday MARCH 14TH, 10am-4.30pm\n\nThe gap in between the two training days allows you to receive support as you experience the 21 day 'cleanse' and integration period after the Reiki attunement - and also enable time to work on developing and practicing the material learnt in the first days training.\n\nTotal of 12 hours tuition time plus some at home practice/study required.\n\nLight simple shared lunches are provided - you will need to bring a contribution.\n\nHerbal teas and light snacks are also provided.\n\nLocation: Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Corner of Aorangi and Tutanekai Streets, Paraparaumu\n\nPre-enrollment questionnaire -\n\nInvestment:\n\n\u00a3555 for full TWO day course, training, all support materials including manual, certificate, light healthy lunch, refreshments and ongoing support. Plus extra hours online in follow up Zoom call on 21st day.\n\nPay in Full Here - https://buy.stripe.com/9B628q2W4ahTghqdcKew81V\n\nA non-refundable $155 deposit secures your place - book here: https://buy.stripe.com/eVqcN4bsA89LaX6b4Cew81S\n\nThere is a payment plan available - contact me\n\nBryony is a Usui Reiki Master Teacher and she has 27 years healing experience. She loves teaching this precious, versatile healing skill and it gives her great pleasure to offer this training in Lancaster\n\nBryony says:\nReiki has had a powerful positive influence on my life, helping me to heal and change mindset, physical and emotional conditions, and to see life in a new light. Reiki helped with my recovery from Chronic Fatigue syndrome and Depression \u2764 I will share this with you in this course and help you open your life to the positive transformation that Reiki can bring.\n\nIf you are interested in coming on this course, please contact me by email at to receive a questionnaire to answer which gives me a sense of your interest, previous experience of Reiki healing and conditions I should be aware of.\n\nCancellation Policy:\n\nIf Heartsong Healing needs to cancel the course all payments are refunded. If you withdraw from the course before 14 days before start date, your payment will be refunded minus the 55 deposit, kept as an admin fee. If you withdraw within 14 -7 days 50% of your payment will be refunded, 7-3 days 75% of your payment will be refunded, 3 days no refund.

I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

Unforgettable.\n\nWhen Matt Joe Gow sings, everything else stops, such is the power of his voice and his songs. Those songs have won awards, from Music Victoria Country Album of the Year (twice) to a New Zealand Country Music Award, with nominations such as an Aotearoa Music Award and various chart positions along the way.\n\nMatt\u2019s voice has been heard in festivals in the United Kingdom and the United States; in venues small and large across Australia and New Zealand; on radio and playlists, and supporting artists such as Chris Isaak and Justin Townes Earle. And every time, he wins new fans, drawn to his amazing vocal tone and his way of bringing the listener closer, telling them stories they will carry with them.\n\nFew artists have that combination of indelible songwriting and an extraordinary voice, along with the commitment to create better art each time and bring it to the audience so they have a transformative live experience. Matt Joe Gow is one of those few. Having recently stepped back from the stage to focus on writing his new album whilst producing other artists, Matt\u2019s upcoming Summer 2026 shows mark a unique and special opportunity to reconnect and see him perform live once again in his home town where it all started.\n\n715PM DOORS\n730PM PERFORMANCE\n\nInfo tickets email:\n\nMobile: 027 245 7887 \u2013 Anna\n\n\nTOUR DATES NZ\nSat Jan 31st Ophir Peace Memorial Hall, Ophir\nSat Feb 7th Niagara Falls Bluegrass & Roots Festival, Catlins*\nSat Feb 21st Moons, Dunedin*\nSat Feb 28th Hilltop House Concerts, Wellington\nFri Mar 13th Wanaka A&P Show, Wanaka\n\n* W/ Trio\n\nFurther info at: https://mattjoegowmusic.com\n\n",

Her practice centres her ancestral river, Waiapu, exploring how \"lens-based practice can contribute to iwi-based aspirations for environmental reinvigoration\".\nAcross a series of discussions with Aotearoa photographers, we will explore key threads in contemporary practice \u2014 including collaboration, process, and evolving photographic culture \u2014 offering insights into the ideas and relationships that shape photography today. We'll close the day in the galleries, with a performance of photographer Ann Shelton\u2019s work The physical garden.\nOpen to photographers, curators, researchers, students, and anyone with an interest in photography, this event invites participants to connect, reflect, and share.\nTickets $60 (waged) / $40 (unwaged) with lunch included.\nAssisted listening\nAn assisted listening system is available for this event.

    "long_description": "INTRODUCING AOTEAROA'S NEWEST FUNDRAISING EVENT: RETHINK\nRETHINK Fundraising 2026 invites you and your team to look at your fundraising programme from a fresh perspective.\nJoin us for a full day of inspirational talks, panel discussions and practical workshops that will leave you energised, AND armed with a toolkit of actionable learnings to take your fundraising to the next level.\nDate: Thursday, 5 March\nVenue: M\u0101karo Room, Wharewaka Function Centre\nTime: 8am-5pm\nCost: $249NZD (exc GST)*\nContact: Anna Shere anna@changeand.co\n*If you prefer to pay via invoice, please email accounts@changeand.co.\nTHE PROGRAM\nFor those of you who joined us for RETHINK Auckland 2025, please note that RETHINK Wellington will feature many of the same sessions from that event, with a few additions to the program and two new guest speakers.\nBranding blindspots \nIn a sector focused on campaigns, conversion, and compliance, brand is often overlooked. But brand isn\u2019t just a logo or a nice story. It\u2019s how people feel about supporting you. And if it's not clear, engaging, or modern \u2013 you\u2019re leaving both money and meaning on the table. This presentation from Tim Dove at re:brand will challenge a few norms and show some examples of it being done well. He\u2019ll get you thinking about your organisation and how you can ensure you\u2019re avoiding the \u2018brand blindspot\u2019. \nRethinking charity comms \nWhen it comes to getting people enthused about our cause, too often we focus on the what rather than the why. Worse, we risk boring our audience to death with earnest, organisation-centric communications which neither inspire nor instruct. Dominique Antarakis from Change&Co will show you a new and fun way to look at your charity comms for maximum engagement and donor retention.  \nWorkshop 1 \nFacilitated workshop which will provide the opportunity to take the learnings from the morning sessions and give you the practical branding and comms tools to take back to your organisation - and transform your fundraising! \nLunch break  \nTake a break, mix and mingle, and enjoy a fabulous lunch selection.\nData, behaviour, and hyper-personalisation \nThis presentation from MIMO/DATAM will show you how to transform raw data into meaningful, multi-channel interactions across email, SMS, voice, and direct mail - all from a single platform. This session will challenge how you think about personalisation - it\u2019s not just about names in subject lines or open rates in eDMs, it\u2019s about burning down the old school campaigns and rebuilding around behaviour, context and connection. \nLessons from the legacy frontlines \nBased on interviews with practitioners from organisations large and small, this session shares unfiltered insights from Gift in Will managers who are doing the work every day\u2014what's actually generating pledges, where they're getting stuck, and what they wish they'd known sooner. Through their collective wisdom, and guided by TEDIREX\u2019s Martin Ruane, we'll explore the biggest challenges facing legacy programs today, the opportunities hiding in plain sight, and tactical takeaways that work for both beginners and experienced practitioners. \nWorkshop 2 \nFacilitated workshop which will provide the opportunity to take the learnings from the afternoon sessions and give you the practical personalisation and AI tools to ramp up acquisition and retention.  \nCFRE ACCREDITATION\nFull participation in RETHINK Fundraising is applicable for 7 points in Category 1.B -Education of the CFRE International application for initial certification and/or recertification.\nEVENT PARTNERS\nChange&Co, DATAM, mimo, re:brand and Tedirex. Special thanks to FIA/FINZ for their support of the day.\nRETHINK has been designed by fundraisers for fundraisers, and we\u2019re keen to make sure you get the most out of the day. We promise no hard-sell, no product placement, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee.\nThe idea is for you to leave at the end of the day with a roadmap to greater donor engagement \u2013 and a sense of renewed energy for what lies ahead.",

    "long_description": "The Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra (AoJO) returns to Wellington with a contemporary re-imagining of one of the most influential works of the 20th century: George Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue. The performance takes place at Meow Nui on Thursday 6 March at 7.00pm, featuring acclaimed pianist Ben Wilcock.\n\nFirst heard in 1924, Rhapsody in Blue broke new ground by fusing jazz language with symphonic form. In this performance, AoJO honours the essence of Gershwin\u2019s original while re-examining the work through a modern big band lens \u2014 expanding its orchestral colours, rhythmic drive, and improvisational possibilities for today\u2019s audiences.\n\nAoJO Musical Director John Rae says the orchestra approached the piece with both respect and curiosity:\n\n\u201cGershwin was writing music that looked forward, not backward. Our aim with this version of Rhapsody in Blue is to treat it the same way, to honour the original while allowing it to speak in a contemporary jazz language that feels alive right now.\u201d\n\nThe performance features pianist Ben Wilcock, widely regarded as one of Aotearoa\u2019s leading jazz artists, whose international career spans Europe, the UK, and New Zealand.\n\n\u201cBen brings an incredible combination of authority, imagination, and openness to this music,\u201d says Rae. \u201cHe understands Gershwin from the inside out, and he\u2019s not afraid to take risks, which is exactly what this piece demands.\u201d\n\nWilcock has been praised internationally for his distinctive musical voice: \u201cWilcock combines dazzling technical command with a rare sense of musical narrative \u2014 his playing is both fearless and deeply expressive.\u201d \u2014 All About Jazz\n\nAnother review described him as \u201cA pianist of remarkable clarity and imagination, equally at home in classical repertoire and cutting-edge jazz.\u201d\n\nAlongside this project, AoJO continues its broader mission of developing large-ensemble jazz in Aotearoa and creating meaningful performance opportunities for local musicians.\n\n\u201cThe Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra exists to celebrate, develop, and present contemporary large-ensemble jazz in Aotearoa \u2014 supporting our musicians, engaging new audiences, and placing this music in a living cultural context rather than a museum one.\u201d\n\nEvent details\nWhat: Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra: Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue\nFeaturing: Ben Wilcock (piano)\nWhere: Meow Nui, Wellington\nWhen: Friday 6 March 2026, 7.00pm",

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

He will also make a solo appearance at Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, where he joins He Manu T\u012boriori, a celebration of waiata reo M\u0101ori, on Saturday 21 March.\nAt the centre of Amber Skies is Muroki\u2019s drive for freedom and new experiences. He believes music only really happens when he is fully living, pushing into new environments, meeting people and adding what he calls seasoning to life. \nThe album was written and recorded between Aotearoa and Berlin, with production by Djeisan Suskov, Justyn Pilbrow and Josh Fountain, and featuring Len Blake and keyboard virtuoso Joe Kaptein. \nMuroki is immersed in the Berlin scene, regularly jamming with musicians including members of Parcels, Rikas and the Zen Men, finding grounding in a city that can be both electric and mellow. He filmed the video for latest single Break It Down in Portugal with director Ezra Simons (Earth Tongue), shot entirely on 16mm film in Peniche and Nazar\u00e9, and also returned to Kenya for the first time since he was sixteen, reconnecting with wh\u0101nau and gaining perspective during this chapter.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been bouncing between places while working on this album. Living nomadically keeps me open and curious. Nothing beats coming back to Aotearoa, and I can\u2019t wait to play these songs live with the band.\u201d\nWith platinum success on Wavy, the Triple J topping Love Cocoon with BENEE and collaborations with LEISURE, Young Franco and NASAYA, Muroki returns home ready to take these songs to the stage.",

From modest beginnings with The Creek Drank the Cradle, through the rustic beauty of The Shepherd\u2019s Dog, the bold explorations of Kiss Each Other Clean and Ghost on Ghost, to the reflective resonance of Beast Epic and the orchestral sweep of Light Verse, Iron & Wine has earned acclaim for its capacity to move between the hushed and the grand with elegance and emotional clarity.\nIron & Wine will perform solo, playing stripped back music from his expansive catalogue including songs from latest album Light Verse, fan favourites from his collaborations with Calexico and I\u2019m With Her, and the cinematic gems such as the slow dance soundtrack from Twilight.",

The huge contribution of Dr Karen Grylls is celebrated in \u2018Ara Hura \u2014 A Visionary Journey\u2019. \nIt\u2019s fitting that this Aotearoa Festival of the Arts concert involves the choir Dr Grylls founded 28 years ago. Voices New Zealand debuted with a concert at the same festival in 1998. It has gone on to build a reputation for excellence in the music world. For this celebratory concert, the choir is joined by taonga p\u016boro artist Horomona Horo, leading instrumentalists, and a chamber ensemble from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. \nThe concert centrepiece is Robert Wiremu\u2019s Re-imagined Mozart: Erebus. The programme also features a new commission from Takerei Komene, as well as waiata by Ng\u0101p\u014d and Pimia Wehi. This highlights Dr Grylls\u2019 pioneering collaborations that reshaped Aotearoa\u2019s choral landscape. Her expertise as a choral clinician is sought internationally, and she regularly conducts masterclasses and workshops in Wales, England, North America, Canada and Australia. \nThis marks Dr Grylls\u2019 final appearance as Music Director of Voices New Zealand. It\u2019s a rare opportunity to celebrate her vision, artistry, and legacy.",

This celebration of gender diversity in ECE will be held in a safe and supportive environment and is a fantastic opportunity to meet others in the profession, share your own story, and be inspired.\nGender Steretoypes in ECE - Mike Collin and Max Christie\nWhat can gender stereotypes teach us about teaching and learning?\nEarly childhood education relies on diversity within teaching teams. Yet, gender stereotypes often shape how we see ourselves and each other as kaiako. This interactive session invites educators to explore the hidden assumptions that influence teaching roles and team dynamics. In this session, Max and Mike will unpack how stereotypes impact collaboration and how every kaiako adds unique value to teaching teams. Participants will leave with practical strategies to challenge bias, strengthen team culture, and celebrate the richness of varied approaches in ECE settings.\nAutism NZ - Thecla Moffat\nMen can change the dynamics of play in ECE benefiting autistic tamariki\nMale kaiako often bring more energy in the ECE setting with an emphasis on more physical activity, outdoor play, \"rough and tumble\" play, and positive risk-taking, which appeals to both boys and girls and provides a different dimension to play than may be beneficial to most autistic tamariki. We now know that through fun and engaging interactions kaiako help enhance the autistic tamariki pivotal capacities for later learning. In this talk kaiako will get to know how men in ECE with their positive energy can make a difference through play for autistic tamariki in their centres. The kaiako will be given a few strategies of how to do that and some ideas to encourage tuakana-teina (peer play) between autistic tamariki and their non-autistic peers will be shared.",

It captures Maltese at his most personal, trading irony for honesty and humour for vulnerability.\n\nMuch like kindred spirits Randy Newman and Father John Misty, beneath Maltese\u2019s sumptuous melodies and classic pop craftsmanship there\u2019s always a lyric that stops you in your tracks \u2013 sometimes breaking your heart, sometimes making you laugh. Across the album\u2019s eleven tracks, Maltese\u2019s trademark wit is still present but wielded with restraint, often emerging through self-deprecation and quiet revelation.\n\nHaving first established himself in 2018 with his debut Bad Contestant, Maltese has since evolved into one of the UK\u2019s finest young songwriters. The albums that followed cemented his reputation for transforming the mundane into something dream-like, his piano harmonies, playful lyricism and quintessentially British wit resonating around the world.\n\nIn late 2024, Maltese embarked on a headline tour across Asia, Australia and New Zealand, following sold-out runs through the US, Europe and the UK \u2013 including his biggest performances to date at The Wiltern in Los Angeles and London\u2019s Electric Brixton. With Hers, he now steps into an even bigger chapter: playing to larger rooms than ever before and connecting with an audience that continues to grow from Sydney to S\u00e3o Paulo, Jakarta to Tokyo.\n\nAudiences can expect an enchanting live experience that blends Maltese\u2019s new material with an favourites spanning his six-album catalogue \u2013 poetic, wry, and unashamedly human.\n\n",

The performance will also feature a selection of hits and best-loved songs spanning the artist\u2019s extraordinary 31-year career.   \nThis is the only leg of the \u2018Red Sunset\u2019 tour featuring orchestra, so expect the songs to be transformed by the powerful accompaniment.

On this walk you'll be accompanied by two guides who will take you on a wander through some of the most magical parts of the cemetery, with a story or two of early Wellingtonians along the route. We might even spy a Ruru/Morepork or two! The tour does not have any scary themes. There are points on the tour where we may pause and turn off our torches to enjoy the landscape in the darkness.\nThe tour is of approximately 1.5 hours duration and starts and finishes at the Main Chapel on Rosehaugh Avenue, where there is plenty of easy parking.\nEach attendee needs to bring their own torch that they can comfortably carry for the duration.

There are no toilets on the route.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee).\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons.

For runners and mountain bikers, it\u2019s a dream come true \u2014 the ultimate stamina challenge set against the wildly beautiful Wellington landscape. \nIn April 2026, the hills and trails around Wellington offer six possible routes for athletes to push their limits. Beginning with 6-kilometre and 12km tests, the routes grow in length to 25km, 53km, 103km, and a colossal 161-kilometre challenge.

    "long_description": "Day 1 \u2013 May 10, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: Working with Dissociative Parts and Their Voices in Complex Trauma and Dissociative Disorders\nOverview:\nThis seminar focuses on adapting EMDR for individuals with dissociative disorders, using the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) Dolores has developed. It provides strategies for working with dissociative parts and their voices and integrating a trauma-informed approach to inner conflict safely from early treatment stages.\nKey Learning Points:\n\u00b7         Identifying and working with dissociative parts and their voices.\n\u00b7         Understanding the function and purpose of \u201chostile\u201d parts.\n\u00b7         Addressing dissociative phobias through EMDR informed techniques.\n\u00b7         Managing resistance and treatment impasses.\n\u00b7         Structuring work with dissociative parts effectively.\nProgram Description:\nAfter many early cautions about the potential dangers of using EMDR with individuals suffering from dissociative disorders, limited methods have been offered for adapting standard EMDR procedures to this specific population. Based on these early cautions, EMDR is still considered by many clinicians as limited to the treatment of traumatic memories in high-functioning dissociative clients and only after a long preparation phase that depends on other treatment modalities. Confined by this conceptualisation, the use of EMDR is too often limited, and many survivors of severe traumatisation are unable to benefit from EMDR reprocessing and, if at all, only much later in the treatment process.\nDolores Mosquera developed (with AnabelGonzalez, M.D.) the Progressive Approach model for treating complex trauma and dissociation (2012) and the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) (2019, 2025). Using this trauma and AIP-informed models, clinicians can safely utilise a wide range of EMDR interventions (including BLS) from early in the preparatory phase of treatment for patients with dissociative disorders.\nIn this seminar, she will present her current practice of working with clients, including video demonstrations. Mosquera's deft clinical skills and ground-breaking innovative thinking teach a middle ground between \"dissociation blind\" aggressive EMDR interventions and overly cautious delays to the use of EMDR reprocessing.\nMany dissociative clients have difficulty with hostile, critical voices. The internal conflict is sometimes so intense that the person even has difficulty carrying on an ordinary conversation. One factor that affects this conflict is how the patient deals with the voices or parts of the self.\nKey Program Content:\nIdentify the internal system of dissociation and internal voices that are hostile and critical\nHow to read the function and purpose behind the saboteur parts of self\nUsing compassion and understanding to help deal with dissociative phobias within the internal system\nSkills to reduce impasses and resistance that may complicate or reduce the efficacy of the treatment\nSpecific steps to organize the work with hostile parts and voices\n Days 2\u20133 \u2013 May 11\u201312, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: From Fragmentation to Integration: A Master Class in Treating Complex Trauma and Dissociation\nFormat: 2-Day Masterclass: Three Clinical Cases from Start to Finish\nAcross two days, Dolores will present three distinct new cases illustrating varying levels of dissociation \u2014 including one with frequent switching and no initial Adult Self. Each session is interactive, highlighting the therapeutic process from assessment to completion.\nOver two immersive days, this advanced master class offers a rare opportunity to observe and analyse complete therapeutic processes under the expert guidance of Dolores Mosquera.\n\nDolores will present three new and distinct clinical cases, each representing different manifestations of complex trauma and dissociation \u2014 including one client who experiences frequent switching and begins therapy without an integrated adult self.\nParticipants will follow these clients\u2019 journeys from the initial stages of therapy through to treatment completion, gaining deep insight into decision-making, pacing, and the integration of EMDR strategies within complex systems. The format is designed to be highly interactive and reflective, combining video demonstrations, live commentary, and group discussion to deepen understanding of safe, flexible, and attuned clinical practice when working with dissociative clients.\nThis master class is ideal for clinicians seeking to refine their skills, expand their conceptual framework, and enhance clinical confidence when navigating the challenges of trauma-related dissociation.\nAdditional Details\n\u00b7         Eligibility: Must have completed at least Part One of EMDR Basic Training (University of Otago or equivalent).\n\u00b7         Certification: Participants receive a Professional Development Certificate of Attendance.\n\u00b7         Dietary needs: Provided upon registration.\n\u00b7         Parking: Paid on-site parking available.\n\u00b7         Accommodation: Discounted rates at a local hotel (discount code to be posted on the event site).",

In 2026, this is more critical than ever, as the general election looms. We need to make digital connectivity and equity front-and-centre of political debate, economic prosperity, and social wellbeing. The decisions made this year will lock in New Zealand\u2019s digital trajectory for the rest of the decade.\n\nThis year, we are proposing that the Summit tackles the crucial question: \u201cHow do we get everyone connected to the best broadband service that meets their needs to live and thrive in our digital future by 2030?\u201d\n\nThis ambitious national goal demands immediate, coordinated action from policymakers, industry, and community leaders. Join us as we delve into the critical issues surrounding digital connectivity in Aotearoa, directly influencing the next government\u2019s mandate. At this early stage, we are proposing that our sub-themes include:\n\nPolicy & Political Mandate: Developing the definitive roadmap for universal connectivity ahead of the 2026 election, securing cross-party commitment to the 2030 target.\n\nRural Connectivity: Bridging the digital divide and ensuring resilient, future-proof access for all, regardless of location.\n\nAffordability & Digital Equity: Examining the total cost barriers (device, data, skills) to internet access and advancing practical solutions for true inclusion.\n\nFuture-Proofing Connectivity: Looking ahead to emerging technologies and innovative, sustainable solutions that will make the 2030 target a reality.\n\nThese are all critical to us meeting our vision that by 2030, everyone in Aotearoa is connected to the best broadband service that meets their needs. This prospectus outlines how you can partner with this Summit to influence the national agenda and help us address the question around how we connect all of Aotearoa.\nThe Minister for Media and Communications, Hon Paul Goldsmith, is confirmed to present the closing Ministerial address.\nPlatinum Partner for 2026:",

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

    "long_description": "Meet Getdown Services \u2013 your new favourite band and one of the UK\u2019s hottest word-of-mouth acts! The brilliantly offbeat cult British duo has been turning heads across Britain and Europe with their balls-to-the-walls live shows, tongue-in-cheek wit, razor-sharp lyrics and infectious disco-fuelled grooves, teetering between chaos and genius. And now, after selling out tours across the UK and Europe, they\u2019re bringing their riotous show down under for the first time in May/June 2026 \u2013 with shows in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Wellington, presented by I OH YOU and MG Live. \nTickets go on sale Friday 14 November at 10.00am local time, with MG Live presale commencing Thursday 13 November at 10.00am local time. Sign up for early access to the MG Live presale here.               \n\u201cI reckon we get people asking us to come to Australia probably every day, and everyone in England is moving there, so will be good to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\u201cAlways been one of those places where you\u2019re like, \u2018Fair enough, but I can\u2019t be arsed with that. It looks mad \u2013 there\u2019s snakes and also it takes 40 hours to get there.\u2019 Will be good fun, though! Went to New Zealand to see a mate of ours get married a few years ago and thought it was a lovely country and I really liked those pies they have. It felt quite similar to the UK in a lot of ways, so playing gigs there should be fun!\u201d\nGetdown Services\n\nFor those in the know, Bristol-based duo Josh Law and Ben Sadler \u2013 aka Getdown Services \u2013 are THE must-see new act of the year. And if you don\u2019t know yet, you will soon \u2026 and you\u2019ll wish you got in early! Named as \u201cone to watch\u201d at this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival and dubbed (by the band themselves) \u201cBritain\u2019s Best Band\u201d, their live shows are equal parts smart, sweaty and gloriously unhinged. Their sound is a wild blend of scrappy indie disco, twisted funk and post-punk energy, turning the absurdity of modern Britain into dancefloor gold.        \n \nThe pair met at school in Minehead, Somerset and now make music together at home in Bristol \u2013 churning out what Rolling Stone called \u201cpower disco with unrepentant silliness\u201d with a healthy dose of satire and swagger. Their highly lauded debut album Crisps (Breakfast Records, 2023) showcased their eclectic danceable grooves and biting social commentary, and a mix of sharp, funny social observations wrapped in irresistible, funk-fuelled rhythms. Follow-up EPs Your Medal\u2019s In The Post, Crumbs and latest, Primordial Slot Machine, cemented their cult status, alongside an arsenal of red-hot singles \u2013 including James Bay\u2019s Hat, Dog Dribble, I Got Views and Eat Quiche, Sleep, Repeat.   \n \n \u201cGetdown Services are unrepentantly silly and constantly deliver one of the most joyously deranged live shows \u2013 just one of the best live bands out there!\u201d\n Rolling Stone\n\u201cTheir live show is as daft and as exhilarating as they come. Five stars.\u201d\n Buzz Magazine\n \n \u201cGenuine contenders to being the most exciting and interesting band in the UK right now.\u201d\n CLASH\n\n Getdown Services look set to gobble up the world, one crumb at a time. Whether you\u2019re into danceable chaos, satirical genius or just want to be ahead of the curve, Getdown Services are the band you didn\u2019t know you needed \u2013 until now! Britain\u2019s favourite new band are about to become yours too! \n\nMG LIVE TERMS OF SALE\n\nhttps://mg.live/termsofsale",

    "long_description": "It\u2019s a stage show that covers vast rivers of galaxies in the cosmos, the ecosystems of Earth, and the structure of the human brain. Emergence is the latest show by English physicist, presenter, and personality Professor Brian Cox. He takes to the stage at TSB Arena to contemplate the dazzling complexity of the universe and how it\u2019s built on profoundly simple principles. \nEmergence is also a scientific history of 400 years of human discovery. How did we come to understand so much about the cosmos? Guided by mathematics, curiosity, and an aesthetic sense of symmetry, our species has begun to read the story of the Universe. We\u2019ve started to carry our spacecraft to the edge of the solar system and outwards to the stars. Brian\u2019s engaging style makes these questions come to life. The audience will be left awestruck and thrilled as the show covers vast topics in an accessible way. \nBrian has appeared in many landmark science programs for BBC radio and television over the last 15 years, from the Peabody Award-winning Wonders of the Solar System to the worldwide hit series The Planets. His previous touring show, Horizons, was performed to nearly half a million people across the world.",

Joining her on stage will be longtime guitarist, Gerry Leonard, and cellist Stephanie Winters. \nSince the release of her self-titled, critically acclaimed 1985 debut album, Suzanne Vega has played to sold-out concerts across the world. She is a masterful storyteller who, according to one The New York Times critique, \u201cobserves the world with a clinically poetic eye.\u201d Her song lyrics often focus on city life, ordinary people, and real-world subjects. They are notably succinct, understated, and immediately recognisable.",

    "long_description": "After three years of closure, the newly renovated and strengthened City Gallery Wellington Te Whare Toi will host the art of Cornelia Parker. The English visual artist is best known for her innovative and contemporary sculpture and installation art. Her large-scale, immersive installations explore themes of destruction and reconstruction, transformation and metamorphosis. Objects are exploded, crushed, and suspended in a world upended and remade anew.\nCurated by independent UK-based curator Andrea Schlieker and City Gallery Wellington\u2019s Senior Curator Aaron Lister, City Gallery Wellington's exhibition will encompass Parker\u2019s long career as an artist. This includes an immersive sound and light installation, \u2018Stolen Thunder\u2019. The work gathers the sounds of approaching storms from around the globe and across time. The exhibition will also showcase her paintings, photos, films, and sculptures.\n\u201cI have always said this is the one exhibition I want to do before I die,\u201d said Charlotte Davy, Ringatohu Toi Director Art and City Gallery Wellington. \u201cI have been following Cornelia Parker\u2019s work for the last twenty years. Bringing her mischievous, dark, and literally explosive work to Wellington is incredible.\u201d \nParker\u2019s work often fills entire rooms and invites the viewer to move through and around the art. Given its physical scale, the blank canvas of the reopened gallery offers the perfect opportunity to host the exhibition. The exhibition will kick off in October 2026, carrying through to March 2027. \nCharlotte notes the exhibition\u2019s themes are also of particular relevance to Wellington. \u201cI hope that the exhibition and our return to Te Ng\u0101kau Civic Square will reflect our city and also help remake it. We are looking forward to opening with a bang.\u201d\nHero image: \u00a9 Cornelia Parker. Courtesy of the artist and Frith Street Gallery, London",

    "long_description": "Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",
