Gemma Hoskins is Am\u00e9lie\u2019s mother, and William Duignan plays the pop icon Elton John. A cast of thirteen takes on many roles, from greengrocers to goldfish. Produced by WITCH Music Theatre, the show captures the whimsy of the film that made Am\u00e9lie a global favourite. It features a Grammy-nominated score by Daniel Mess\u00e9 and Nathan Tyson, as well as a witty book by Craig Lucas. Directors Maya Handa Naff and Nick Lerew, with music director Hayden Taylor, bring Am\u00e9lie\u2019s quirky world to life.

Its return 34 years later at the 2026 festival is highly anticipated. It has become a landmark piece of New Zealand theatre \u2014 exploring the tension between past and future. Set in the summer of 1965, the play follows Hone, who brings his family from New Zealand\u2019s East Cape to the South Island in search of a better life. As they gather for a beachside birthday h\u0101ng\u012b with their P\u0101keh\u0101 guests, buried secrets and cultural tensions rise to the surface. Far from their  t\u012bpuna , the family must navigate questions of identity, belonging, and survival. \nWaiora Te \u016akaip\u014d was conceived, written and directed by Hone Kouka (Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101ti Raukawa, Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu). The multi-award-winning writer/director has penned 13 plays. Many have been staged in Aotearoa and further afield in Canada, South Africa, New Caledonia, and the UK. Waiora Te \u016akaip\u014d is presented in partnership with the Aotearoa New Zealand Festival of the Arts, Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, Auckland Theatre Company and Tawata Productions.",

    "long_description": "It\u2019s Westerberg High, where popularity is a matter of life and death. Welcome to \u2018Heathers the Musical\u201d. Based on a movie with the same name, the show is a coming-of-age story dealing with love, heartache, defying expectations, and being true to yourself. It originally premiered in Los Angeles in 2013. Since then, the musical has had record-breaking seasons across the globe. It now makes its professional New Zealand debut in 2026, and Wellington is in line to join the school assembly. Described as a high-octane, black comedy rock musical, Heathers is packed with a mix of ballads and showstoppers. The catchy tunes are written by Kevin Murphy (Desperate Housewives) and Laurence O\u2019Keefe (Legally Blonde: The Musical). \nThe 1989 film starred Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. It quickly achieved cult status among audiences. Both the movie and musical follow high school student Veronica Sawyer. Veronica is just another nobody until she\u2019s unexpectedly taken under the wings of the beautiful and cruel Heathers. When mysterious teen rebel J.D. arrives, Veronica learns that it might kill to be a nobody, but it's murder being a somebody. \nThis special production will feature a stellar Australasian cast. So grab your scrunchies, break out the Corn Nuts and wait for the bell to ring.",

    "description": "By looking within our own mind, we can find similar stillness and refuge from the stress and chaos of our modern life and learn to really relax.\nWe\u2019ll set off on a gentle voyage of exploration of our mind, developing our understanding of the way in which our mind is the source of our awareness, how thoughts and feelings arise from but always dissolve back into our minds.\nWe will become more familiar with the deep and profound sense of clarity and peace that arises when our minds are still and undistracted, and which discover our inner potential for peace, happiness and real relaxation.\nWe will explore how meditating on our own mind offers us the ability to let go of stress and worry by enabling us to get a clearer, more dispassionate view of our own thoughts and feelings.\nOur general programme classes include Dharma teachings along with guided meditations."

It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

He has had a variety of careers however employment has mostly been a means to an end, and his real career continues to revolve around the mountains.\nHe has been on expeditions to the Northern Patagonian Icecap, Himalayas, Karakoram Range, Yunnan and Tibet and worked in the Dry Valleys for Antarctica New Zealand.

In recent years, Geoff has been actively involved in the care of our back country assets and is a founding member of the Backcountry Trust Board.\nEnquiries:\nDave Bamford, dave@davebamford.co.nz Tel 027 457 0313\nAndy Carruthers, chair@wellingtonalpineclub.org.nz Tel 021 244 6051\n\nMature Mountaineer meetings are a NZ Alpine Club initiative providing an opportunity for older members of the NZAC & affiliated clubs to get together, share and hear stories (usually from an invited speaker), and have afternoon tea. The intention is to provide a social gathering for those less likely to go out to evening events. The concept has been successful in Christchurch (since 2006), Auckland and Wellington. The functions are open to all interested outdoor enthusiasts and are made possible thanks to support from T\u016bpiki Trust. ",

Their live shows are the stuff of legend, their studio output of essential albums and EPs through the 90s and 2000s have become touchstones for generations of musicians both here and abroad.\nThe return of Tristan Dingemans, Neil Phillips, and Constantine Karlis to the stage and a rare chance to witness HDU in full flight is nothing short of a seismic event.

    "description": "After close to a decade away from live stages, the mighty High Dependency Unit return this November announcing their first shows since 2016 including a key festival performance at The Others Way, and an all ages show in Port Chalmers to kick off the tour.\nSince their formation in 1993, HDU have carved out a singular space in Aotearoa\u2019s music landscape, fusing and funneling shoegaze and psychedelic noise into hypnotic, sonic power.\nTheir live shows are the stuff of legend, their studio output of essential albums and EPs through the 90s and 2000s have become touchstones for generations of musicians both here and abroad.\nThe return of Tristan Dingemans, Neil Phillips, and Constantine Karlis to the stage and a rare chance to witness HDU in full flight is nothing short of a seismic event.\nThese November dates will see the band revisit their formidable back catalogue and remind audiences why they\u2019ve long been considered one of New Zealand\u2019s most powerful live acts."

    "long_description": "Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Paci\ufb01c style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and e\ufb00ective insights. Tai refers to ocean waters, which represent your opportunity to rise through the ebb and \ufb02ow of this learning journey. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from di\ufb00erent communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from Voices from the Moana?\nIn Voices from the Moana, you will explore and share rich narratives of healing and resilience from different Pacific nations and perspectives. The Pacific ocean is a diverse place and we have our own unique stories of healing through traditional practices, beliefs and methods. This Talanoa Tai learning experience invites reflection on your own understanding of different healing modalities from the Pacific and the impact it has on your worldview. It will equip you to advocate for social justice through Pacific voices. You'll gain practical tolls and insights that you can apply directly to your work.\nThis is a 3 hour in-person learning experience.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\n Facilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives. Fa\u2019aeafale\u2019upolu (Polu) Samuelu is the facilitator of this Talanoa Tai Learning experience.",

    "long_description": "In 1947, M\u0101ori leader, politician, and scholar Apirana Ngata spoke to his scholarly peers at the Polynesian Society, announcing his greatest desire to revive M\u0101ori culture as a living force within communities, not be relegated to dead exhibits in museums (Ramsden 1948, 85).\nThis lecture acknowledges the concerns of visionary leaders and champions of cultural practice and their activation within museums. Through her work as a M\u0101ori curator, writer, cultural practitioner and post-doctoral researcher, Awhina Tamarapa advocates for cultural restoration as a form of liberation in a museum context. In her research, Tamarapa is exploring strategies for the recovery and reclamation of taonga puoro (singing treasures) and karetao (animated storytellers) for new generations.\nThere are challenges regarding taonga held by overseas museums. Concepts such as keeping taonga warm, and mana taonga, recognises the connection and authority of descendants to their taonga, that underpin this work.\nThe focus on the reclamation of Indigenous practice has been bolstered by working with First Nations, Canada BC. Led by Professor Bryony Onciul, University of Exeter, UK, Tamarapa was privileged to be part of a research project \u201cThe Future of Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities: Ancestral governance, environmental stewardship, language revival, and cultural vibrancy\u201d funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK.\n_________\nThe Michael Volkerling Lecture series is a partnership event with the Museum and Heritage Studies programme at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington, National Services Te Paerangi and Te Papa Tongarewa. This annual public lecture series recognises the legacy of the late Dr Michael Volkerling who was one of the principal architects of New Zealand's cultural and creative sectors.",

    "long_description": "Join us for this fabulous event featuring three wild-swimming writers, each inspired in their own unique way by their connection to the ocean. Authors Ingrid Horrocks, Shona Riddell, and Kate Camp will be in conversation with host and wild swimmer extraordinaire Corrina Connor.\nMeet our panel:\nIngrid Horrocks is a writer whose work spans poetry, travel, environment, and community. Her many books include the memoir Where We Swim, described as \u201ca book about family that travels by water in the body of a swimmer\u201d, Women Wanderers, as well as two collections of poetry. Her new collection of short stories All Her Lives was published by Te Herenga Waka University Press in October.\nShona Riddell is an author, journalist, podcaster, and swimmer. Her books include Trial of Strength: Adventures and Misadventures on the Wild and Remote Subantarctic Islands and Guiding Lights: The Extraordinary Lives of Lighthouse Women, both published by Exisle Publishing. She has a Master's degree (Science in Society) and hosts a podcast called Swim Chats where she interviews swimmers, coaches, and marine scientists. Shona says: \u201cI like cold weather, being near the ocean (and swimming in it), and learning about remote locations\u201d.\nKate Camp is an award-winning poet and writer. Her first collection of poetry, Unfamiliar Legends of the Stars, won the NZSA Jessie Mackay Award for Best First Book of Poetry at the 1999 Montana New Zealand Book Awards, and she has gone on to publish six more poetry collections, most recently the wonderful Makeshift Seasons (2025). Kate is also a reviewer and essayist and is a familiar voice on Radio NZ.\nMeet our host:\nCorrina Connor is a marathon swimmer, cellist and one of our very own librarians. Be it the beaches or pools, libraries or music, Corrina makes the most of the opportunities P\u014dneke provides, in both work and play. In the past few years she has taken on several marathon swims, including Te Moana-o-Raukawa (Cook Strait), Te Ara-a-Kiwa (Foveaux Strait), and Lake Taup\u014d (a mere 40.2 kilometres); as well as undertaking several hypothermia-inducing \u2018ice swims\u2019, defined as swimming in water of five degrees or less.\nThis is a free event -- all welcome. Please note: we expect this event to be extremely popular, and seating will be on a first come first served basis. ",

    "long_description": "Ali Whitton is a New Zealand-based singer-songwriter. Born in Aotearoa and raised in rural North Yorkshire, his music blends introspective folk, alt-country, and acoustic storytelling, drawing inspiration from artists like Nick Drake, Bright Eyes, Johnny Cash, and Bob Dylan.\nWith poetic lyrics rooted in nature and emotional honesty, his songs explore themes of longing, resilience, and cosmic wonder. After an early career touring the UK and France \u2013 including sharing stages with Ed Sheeran \u2013 Ali settled in Aotearoa New Zealand, where salty sea winds and bush covered landscapes continue to shape his sound.\n-----------------\nTom Cunliffe returns with 'Spit Out Your Gum' \u2013 his fourth album and most intimate release to date. Vivid, offbeat, and full of heart, the record captures Cunliffe at his most direct, delivering a collection of songs that glow with warmth and humanity.\nAcross its tracks, Cunliffe takes listeners on a journey from the streets of London to the bright lights of Karangahape Road, and out into the cold green waves of the Irish Sea. Each song feels alive \u2013 steeped in imagery, character, and a quiet intensity that rewards deep listening.\nRecorded live-to-tape at Roundhead Studios, 'Spit Out Your Gum' carries the unmistakable warmth of that hallowed room and the people within it. With Paddy Hill engineering, Cunliffe was joined by Dave Khan (violin, piano) and Cass Basil (bass, clarinet).\nTogether, they captured performances that unfold in real time \u2013 no edits, no digital polish, just songs recorded in single takes, preserving the intimacy, imperfection, and energy of the moment.\n\n",

    "long_description": "A theatrical double-shot from an iconic playwright and one of our greatest actors.\n\nBruce Mason is perhaps the most significant playwright in Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s theatrical history. Writing with courage and insight, he was a lover of language and a champion of the underdog.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1978, Bruce toured the country, telling uniquely Kiwi stories about emerging identity, cultural cringe and social difference. From church halls to country shearing sheds to the Edinburgh Festival, Bruce would play anywhere, in any circumstance, to any audience.\n\nTo celebrate his extraordinary legacy, Brilliant Adventures and Circa Theatre are collaborating to make two of his greatest solo works resound for a new age.\n\nTwo plays: timeless, universal, distinct. Following their critically acclaimed, sold out run of THINGS I KNOW TO BE TRUE, actor Stephen Lovatt and director Shane Bosher return to Circa for a not-to-be missed theatrical encounter with a master craftsman.\n\n\nTHE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER\n\u201cI invite you to join me, in a voyage into the past, to that territory of the heart we call childhood.\u201d\n\nBruce Mason\u2019s quintessential Kiwi classic chronicles the friendship between a 12-year-old boy and Firpo, a social outcast who dreams of winning an Olympic medal.\n\nThrough the boy\u2019s eyes we see the wonder of life on a perfect beach, in a perfect 1930s New Zealand, during a perfect summer. It\u2019s a world of magic and transformation, where anything can happen and miracles seem possible.\n\nWhen the boy sets out to help Firpo make his athletic dream a reality, ignoring his father\u2019s rebukes and community ridicule, a battle rages between the eternal optimism of childhood and the harsh pragmatism of adulthood.\n\nGliding effortlessly between flights of poetic fancy and blunt everyday speech, THE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER is New Zealand storytelling at its very best.\n\n\nNOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES\nAn adolescent boy tries to find his place in an adult-dominated world. A young man retraces an intensely felt boyhood experience of bullying. A playwright in his last days reconciles the value of an artistic life and challenges the idea of New Zealand identity.\n\nComic disasters and confronting your own hubris. NOT CHRISTMAS, BUT GUY FAWKES is a richly autobiographical search for self-expression. Profound and true, it is a set of variations about over-reaching, cheekily confronting our very own Tall Poppy Syndrome.\n\nCelebrating Bruce Mason\nDirected by Shane Bosher\nPerformed by Stephen Lovatt\n\nPlease note The End of the Golden Weather and Not Christmas, but Guy Fawkes tickets need to be purchases separately, see the Circa Theatre website for full dates and ticket details.",

Each song feels alive \u2013 steeped in imagery, character, and a quiet intensity that rewards deep listening.\nRecorded live-to-tape at Roundhead Studios, 'Spit Out Your Gum' carries the unmistakable warmth of that hallowed room and the people within it. With Paddy Hill engineering, Cunliffe was joined by Dave Khan (violin, piano) and Cass Basil (bass, clarinet).\nTogether, they captured performances that unfold in real time \u2013 no edits, no digital polish, just songs recorded in single takes, preserving the intimacy, imperfection, and energy of the moment.\nAli Whitton is a New Zealand-based singer-songwriter. Born in Aotearoa and raised in rural North Yorkshire, his music blends introspective folk, alt-country, and acoustic storytelling, drawing inspiration from artists like Nick Drake, Bright Eyes, Johnny Cash, and Bob Dylan.\nWith poetic lyrics rooted in nature and emotional honesty, his songs explore themes of longing, resilience, and cosmic wonder. After an early career touring the UK and France \u2013 including sharing stages with Ed Sheeran \u2013 Ali settled in Aotearoa New Zealand, where salty sea winds and bush covered landscapes continue to shape his sound.

    "long_description": "What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

    "long_description": "Twentysix is pleased to present the last show of the year by \u014ctautahi based artist couple Hugo Van Dorsser and Catarina Correia Arnhold. With a sense of play and punchy, evocative colour at the centre - \u2018Thoughts That Make Us Think\u2019 is a meeting of material worlds. Gallery walls are met with a bold expression of life and an unapologetic exploration into how the artists\u2019 materials can perform on behalf of their intuition and imagination. At times looking back in nostalgia, while others look inward toward the spirit and self.\nVan Dorsser works, predominately in oil paint, in thick strokes. Drawn with a confident hand in building block shapes, he references childhood with toy cars and little houses, as well as employing the symbol of the butterfly to explore hope and change - all collaged together with a blurry face hidden at the side. They are dreamlike, the surreal spelt out with each canvas, Van Dorsser piecing together - and thus inviting his viewers - into an emotional landscape of shared nostalgia.\nCorreia Arnhold\u2019s gritty clay shapes are a visualisation of emotion - created quickly, roughly - following her at the height of feeling. Spanning both three dimensional and wall bound, each piece is an exploration of the artist\u2019s central symbols of the subconscious, religion and memory. Rough clay is layered in glossy, bright pastel glazes, set against deep, matte finishes - working in juxtaposition to expose conflicting narratives. Her use of the lone rider, priests, a crowd and holy figures throughout, asks of reality versus imagination, sentimentality versus fantasy, day to day versus the preternatural. An ongoing balance between a welcomed freedom of material and a language of myth, memory, and personal narrative.\nThe two artists sidestep together into a landscape of play. Testing boundary lines between material and reality, between fantasy and a blurred memory - all lit in vivid colour. \u2018Thoughts That Make Us Think\u2019 asks us to pace along after them, indulged in their two worlds.\nJoin us for the opening celebration on Friday, 28 November at 6pm \u2013 both artists will be present.\nThe exhibition runs from 29 November \u2013 20 December 2025 at Twentysix Gallery.\nOpening Hours:\nThursday 12pm - 6pm\nFriday 12pm - 6pm\nSaturday 10am - 4pm\nOr by appointment ",

Each garden tells a story and provides a visual image of wonderful creations.\nOne garden, allegedly with the best vista, has not been opened to the public before. One garden has previously featured in the House and Garden magazine. The tour (self-guided) will begin with lunch and an opportunity to buy potted plants in the tranquil St Alban's church garden, 11 Ngaio St Eastbourne, Lower Hutt, Wellington. The tour will end with hors d'oeuvre, wine and live music in the last garden.\nThis is a chance not just to visit amazing gardens but support the earthquake strengthening of St Alban's historic church and hall for a rejuvenated community hub.\nSt Albans church garden\nThe six private gardens all lie within a less than 100 m walk of the 83 Metlink Marine Parade bus route, but a car or bicycle would be more convenient.\nA glimpse of the six separate gardens (a-e).\na\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\nf\nThe garden show is in support of earthquake strengthening of the de Jersey Clere designed St Alban's church and adjacent hall to remake this a community hub.\nFor the last hundred years and more, this beautiful church designed by acclaimed architect Frederick de Jersey Clere has been the heart of Anglican parish life for people in the eastern bays of Wellington. People have rejoiced, prayed and wept in it through happy family milestones and sad occasions, through two world wars and countless celebrations and crises. Along with its parish hall and tranquil garden, it has been the base for social and community services and outreach, and its memorial wall houses the ashes of local residents.\nBut in 2016 the congregation had to suddenly leave the church, which was deemed an earthquake risk.\nSince then, the parish has explored alternatives for continuing its life and service to the people of the eastern bays. In that process it has kept its ministry and worship going through borrowed premises in local schools and other churches. Now, however, the parish has decided it needs to go back to its original base and strengthen both St Alban\u2019s Church and the parish hall so it can continue to serve the community from its heart and home in Ngaio Street, for the next hundred years and more.\nDetailed plans for strengthening the church and hall to meet acceptable safety standards have been drawn up, and fund-raising is under way. The parish is a registered charity (CC22188) and tax-deductible receipts will be issued for all donations.\nPostponement by 1 day to 30 Nov if weather were to dictate and would be announced on this web site.",

With a view to celebrate their recent friendship, which includes an unlikely combination of kiwiana-indie-folk-celtic-rock-alternative-pop music and a shared love for mullets and bowl-cuts, these strangely adorable creatures will blow your socks off.\nKicking off the evening are alt-folk artists Moon Goose who recently released their debut EP \u2018On the island where our shadows lie\u2019, showcasing their dark-yet-bright blend of Celtic-inspired folk music. Their songs include both traditional folk songs from the British Isles and original compositions that celebrate nature, friendship, and the magic of storytelling. With intricate harmonies, deep folk-scapes, glittering guitar and fiddle riffs, Moon Goose will move you deep and good.\nUnique creatures of growing renown, NATIONAL SENSATION have been compared to Kate Bush, Bjork, Devendra Banhart, Jefferson Airplane, The Phoenix Foundation, Florence and the Machine, London Grammar, The Topp Twins and various other bands that they are trying really hard to rip off without infringing on copyright. You\u2019ll get bloody good bangers, ballads, banter and more as they sing about the serious stuff, like calling Aotearoa home, your Mum, the bush, death in a funny way, death in a sad way and your local Residents Association. They haven\u2019t peaked yet so see them before they\u2019re washed up.\nDoors open at 4:30pm\nMusic starts at 5pm\nTickets: $20\nArtist support: $30\nDoor sales: $25",

It then focuses on the Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous geological periods, characterised by the appearance of the likes of scale trees, seed ferns and calamites.\u2026.and the swamp forests that gave rise to the production of coal. Then it advances to the Permian period, including Gondwana prior to its eventual breakup, and the beautiful, strange, gymnosperm Glossopteris that was widespread in the ancient southern continents, embracing what is now New Zealand/Aotearoa. Finally, it progresses to the world of \u2018living fossils\u2019 such as ginkgo and the even more primitive horsetails. Attention will be drawn to some of the animals that populated this ancient world.\n\nLocated in the Treehouse Seminar Room, Wellington Botanic Garden ki Paek\u0101k\u0101.\nFree of charge.

    "long_description": "Working with a live model offers artists an invaluable opportunity to engage directly with the human form. The immediacy of the model\u2019s presence encourages close observation and instinctive decision-making, leading to work that is expressive and real. This hands-on interaction brings a sense of movement and authenticity that\u2019s hard to achieve otherwise.\n\nThe sculpting process typically starts by analyzing the model\u2019s proportions and pose. A wire armature is built to support the structure, and clay is gradually applied to develop the form to a one-third life size, 750mm tall figure. From there, the artist refines the shapes focusing on anatomical accuracy and expressive detail that give the sculpture its final character.\n\nPlease visit the website to know more about the event.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in traditional sculpture and the film industry, Javier is not just a sculptor \u2014 he\u2019s a mentor. Trained in classical techniques, he studied fine arts and took anatomy courses at medical school, developing a rare combination of artistic and anatomical knowledge. He spent over five years at the world-renowned Weta Workshop, contributing to major films and exhibitions, and has worked across materials, scales, and digital technologies.\n\nMaterial is included in the price.\n\nArmature is supplied during the workshop.\n\nYou can buy our tools during the workshop if you like.\n\nTea, Coffee & snacks will be available.\n\nWe do share meals during the workshop.\n\nRefunds are subjected to Terms & conditions",

Register to receive a Zoom link: https://dia-nz.zoom.us/.../WN_p6_8lW8vSyOLAnFYTHhOgw...\nA conversation with author Saraid de Silva\nThis year\u2019s Randell Cottage writers-in-residence are Titaua Peu (French writer-in-resident) and Saraid de Silva (New Zealand writer-in-resident).\nJoin Saraid de Silva in conversation with Randell Cottage trustee Francis Cooke. Saraid will also read from her new novel, which promises to be very different from her first and acclaimed book Amma. But how different will it be from Amma\u2019s stories that follow three generations of South Asian women? Saraid says her Untitled Second Novel is a revenge thriller about two best friends in a stolen car, crossing the country to crash a New Year\u2019s Eve party.\nVideo reflections from former writers in residence\nFollowing the conversation, French Cultural Counsellor, Fran\u00e7ois Bockel, will present the latest in the series of short videos of writers-in-residence reflecting on their experience at Randell Cottage. Titaua Peu was the French writer-in-residence earlier this year, and New Zealander Hinemoana Baker was the 2024 New Zealand writer-in-residence.\nThe videos form part of Randell Cottage\u2019s recorded oral history, designed to capture the essence of those writers and their interests while undertaking their fellowships.\nRSVP to let us know you are coming\nLight refreshments will be provided so RSVP before 1 December to info@randellcottage.co.nz.\nRandell Cottage writer\u2019s residency\nWellington\u2019s historic Randell Cottage has been a writers\u2019 residency for New Zealand and French writers since 2001. The Randell Cottage Writers Trust is supported by the New Zealand-France Friendship Fund/Arts Foundation of New Zealand, and the Wellington City Council. It works in close partnership with the Embassy of France.\nAbout the speakers\nSaraid de Silva is a Sri Lankan P\u0101keh\u0101 writer and arts worker based in T\u0101maki Makaurau. She was the co-creator and co-host of Radio New Zealand\u2019s podcast and video series Conversations with My Immigrant Parents and has recently worked as a storyliner, script writer, and script editor on New Zealand television shows. Her first novel, Amma, was released in New Zealand and Australia by Hachette New Zealand in March 2024 and in the UK by Weatherglass Books in April 2024. It was long-listed for the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Literature in the Ockham Awards and the UK Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction.\nTitaua Peu is a Tahitian novelist who stayed in Randell Cottage during the first half of 2025 as the French writer-in-residence. She is working on a new series of books that present a near future marked by a reverse migration, one in which inhabitants of Aotearoa have migrated north to the island of Mangareva in French Polynesia following a great war. The first laureate from French Polynesia, Titaua is considered one of the principal French-speaking voices in the literature of the Pacific, with her writings focusing on Polynesian society, the impact of colonialism and the place of women.",

    "long_description": "A bespoke Draw It Out workshop for Fertility NZ, open to all genders.\nTickets: $34.50pp\nTheme: Strengthen self-care for the holiday season\nStrengthen your inner resources to care for yourself over the holiday season, and meet others going through similar experiences through this online national workshop, using a gentle powerful tool called Interactive Drawing Therapy.\n\nFertilityNZ exists to support New Zealanders experiencing fertility problems, whether facing challenges becoming or staying pregnant. This bespoke workshop shares drawing for wellness, to tap into your inner guidance for support, within a safe space where others may be experiencing similar journeys.\nIncluded in your workshop\nYou will be guided by Lara Phillips, a trained creative facilitator in Interactive Drawing Therapy, through drawing prompts (similar to a guided meditation or journaling) to draw out where you are at and draw out your own inner guidance. No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\nWhat you will need\nAs this is an online workshop, you will need a computer in a comfortable, quiet setting. A hard surface to draw on (like a desk or a board), three to five pages of A3 paper (you can also tape two A4 printing papers together), and any colouring tools of your choice. Crayons are great as they are more child-like so you don't worry about how it looks. Coloured pastels or pencils are also good, or any coloured markers. The key is a range of colours.\n\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz.\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing. It is not intended as therapy nor does it replace counselling, therapy, or any other medical or clinical professional help. Participants are guided to draw out where they are at, whilst drawing out their own inner resources for support and guidance.\nParticipants understand it is their own responsibility to manage their mental and physical health during sessions, to opt in and out of activities as they see fit, and make the facilitator aware if further support is required.",

    "long_description": "5 days Figure Sculpting workshop with model\nThe immediacy of the model\u2019s presence encourages close observation and instinctive decision-making leading to work that is expressive and real. This hands-on interaction brings a sense of movement and authenticity that\u2019s hard to achieve otherwise.\n\nThe sculpting process typically starts by analyzing the model\u2019s proportions and pose. A wire armature is built to support the structure and clay is gradually applied to develop the form to a one-third life size 750mm tall figure. From there the artist refines the shapes focusing on anatomical accuracy and expressive detail that give the sculpture its final character.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in traditional sculpture and the film industry Javier is not just a sculptor \u2014 he\u2019s a mentor. Trained in classical techniques he studied fine arts and took anatomy courses at medical school developing a rare combination of artistic and anatomical knowledge. He spent over five years at the world-renowned Weta Workshop contributing to major films and exhibitions and has worked across materials scales and digital technologies.\n\nMaterial is included in the price.\nArmature is supplied during the workshop.\nYou can buy our tools during the workshop if you like.\nTea\n\nAlso check out other Workshops in Lower Hutt, Arts events in Lower Hutt, Fine Arts events in Lower Hutt.",

The team of famous Kiwi musicians at Come Together are now putting it all to the test. Kiwi vs Oz Rock Big End of Year Bash 2025 packs the biggest hits from both sides of the ditch onto one stage. Some of New Zealand\u2019s most iconic rock musicians will tear through these legendary antipodean tracks in an all-out rock fest. You can decide who truly owns rock. Is it the swagger of Aussie pub rock or the grit and heart of Kiwi anthems? Perhaps it\u2019s both. \nGet ready to hear the biggest tunes from AC/DC, Split Enz, Cold Chisel, The Datsuns, INXS, DD Smash, Silverchair, Australian Crawl, and Hello Sailor. That\u2019s just for starters, so the showdown is set to be epic. Here\u2019s the kicker \u2014 you help shape the setlist, and when the amps power down, you vote for which nation takes home the crown. \nThis is more than a concert \u2014 it\u2019s a massive celebration of the music we grew up to, the songs that built us, and the riffs that still get us moving. Grab your mates, grab your tickets, and get ready to make some noise.",

Despite the repeated failure of standard policy processes, citizens assemblies have only recently made it to New Zealand. Register for this event to find out more about the Porirua Assembly on Climate and its innovations. \nPorirua is known for community-led innovations in governance and delivery, and the Porirua Assembly on Climate continued this tradition by being:\nthe first climate assembly in New Zealand,  \nthe first assembly co-designed and organised by an iwi authority and a community group, \nthe first assembly process designed to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi by using a tricameral design,  \nthe first New Zealand assembly to include children and young people, and \nby creating a new local governance body - the Porirua Community Leaders Forum - that sponsored the Assembly, holds its recommendations and can instigate ongoing community dialogue on local issues. \nPanellists will share learning on the Porirua Assembly\u2019s innovations, talk about why the standard citizens assembly model was modified, dig into what enabled so many firsts and how these worked out in practice. They will reflect on this legacy and possible future impacts. Might these democratic innovations strengthen local democracy elsewhere in Aotearoa New Zealand? \nAbout the Host and Speakers\nJodi Watene is a Systems Change Lead at Te R\u016bnanga o Toa Rangatira Incorporated, was the project manager for the Porirua Assembly and is helping to establish a New Zealand Community of Practice on Indigenous Citizens\u2019 Assemblies.\nMakerita Makapelu is a Team Leader for Wesley Community Action in Porirua with a background in performing arts and youth work. She specialises in community-led development and grassroots systems change, and was one of the Porirua Assembly facilitators.  \nCally O'Neill was a participatory designer of community spaces until 2019 when she shifted her focus towards advocating for Te Tiriti-based deliberative democracy to address the climate and other contemporary crises. She is a founding member of Te Reo O Ng\u0101 T\u0101ngata/The People Speak and was one of the Porirua Assembly facilitators. \nFuture Unity, a youth climate group formed during the Assembly process will be represented by Orini Rokx-Taratu and Santino Morehu, who were participants in the Assembly\u2019s youth and community streams.  \nEmily Beausoleil is an Associate Professor at Te Herenga Waka - Victoria University of Wellington. Her research as a political theorist centres on the dynamics, conditions and challenges of democratic engagement in diverse societies.

    "long_description": "Sign up here: https://luma.com/ftstwellington10\nF*ck the Small Talk has traveled the world from Berlin, Melbourne, London, Lisbon, and Mexico City, to Lisbon and is now coming to Wellington!\n\nWHAT'S THIS ABOUT?\nFTST is a one-of-a-kind social experience where strangers come together for an afternoon of meaningful, fun, and deep conversation. It\u2019s also just a different & cool way of meeting new people by getting a bit out of your comfort zone and skipping the small talk!\nJoin us for games, talks, and connections with friends you haven\u2019t met yet. Join if you get annoyed after being asked what you do, where you are from, and how long you have been in Wellington every single time you meet someone. If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll never have to speak in public if you don\u2019t want to!\n\nHOW TO JOIN?\nTake 2 minutes to fill out our form\n\nhttps://luma.com/ftstwellington10\nOur events are limited to 30 handpicked guests to ensure a cozy atmosphere. We prioritize a balance in gender and cultural diversity, making each gathering a unique blend of perspectives! If you're invited you'll receive an invite with a special link via our ticketing platform Luma\n\nHOW MUCH IS IT?\nThe cost to attend is NZD 23 (early llama) - NZD 25 (general llama) and includes the following:\n3 hours of facilitated and curated activities\nLight snacks to keep the energy going (only if outdoors)\nA space to meet new people in the least boring way possible\nSupporting our mission to slowly eliminate small talk around the world\nAlso includes those pesky ticket fees!\n\nWHERE IS IT?\nWe host our events in awesome cafes, rooftops, and bars across the city. We only reveal the location to ticket holders 24 hours before the event.\n\nWHAT THEY SAY\n\u201cGreat way to connect with people in a more meaningful way. Get to the heart of the matter, dive straight into what really counts!\u201d - Matthias\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of activity humanity needs every weekend. Thank you for all.\u201d - Sonya\n\n\u201cF*ck the Small Talk changes the narrative from \"Where are you from?\" to \"When was the last time you laughed uncontrollably?\" and I think that's beautiful.\u201d - Monika\n\n\u201cI loved F*ck the small talk, I was a little bit nervous at first but they are pros at making you feel comfortable with the rest of the group, the activities are really fun and I enjoyed every second (consider that the one who's saying this is very, very shy). Give it a try!\u201d - Brenda\n\n\"it\u2019s a wonderful experience, it\u2019s like being a kid again, when you were at the park, playing with other kids, and just decided you were going to be best friends for the next hours. Maybe you\u2019ll never see those kids again.

    "long_description": "Join us to hear Dr Maia Nuku (Ng\u0101i Tai) deliver the annual Gordon H Brown Lecture, hosted in collaboration with Victoria University and the Adam Art Gallery. Nuku is the Evelyn A. J. Hall and John A. Friede Curator for Oceanic Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\nWhat is the role and relevancy of museums in the 21st century? Are they living, expansive archives of Indigenous knowledge? Or outdated relics of colonial pasts.\nThe complete overhaul and construction of new galleries for the Arts of Oceania at The Metropolitan Museum in New York gave curator Maia Nuku a unique opportunity to reframe the galleries conceptually; to emphasize connectivity in the context of global and local histories; and elevate the equally critical arts of storytelling, oratory, and performance alongside Oceania\u2019s dynamic visual arts. Curator Maia Nuku shares insights into the 10-year project that has culminated in a suite of galleries that offer international visitors perspectives on art that reach deep into Oceania\u2019s past while also acknowledging ongoing manifestations of its agency in the present.\nBorn in London of English and M\u0101ori (Ngai Tai) descent, Dr. Maia Nuku is Curator for the Arts of Oceania at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She completed two post-doctoral fellowships at the University of Cambridge (2008-2014) as part of an international research team exploring Oceanic art collections in European museums in France, Spain, the Netherlands and Russia. Researching the collections alongside Pacific artists and practitioners, the work was collaborative and sought to create access to these collections both in the physical and digital domains. During her time at the Met, Maia has evolved a curatorial approach that centers indigenous Pacific perspectives, grounding the presentation of visual arts in the unique conceptual and cosmological connections that make art from Oceania so compelling. In 2023, her exhibition The Shape of Time: Art and Ancestors of Oceania travelled to Museum of Art in Pudong, Shanghai (June 1 - Aug 20, 2023) and National Museum of Qatar (Oct 23, 2023 - Jan 15, 2024).  For the past eight years, Maia has overseen a major reinstallation of the Oceania galleries at the Metropolitan Museum which showcases the creativity of indigenous Pacific artists from the 18th century to the present through the compelling lenses of global history, indigenous storytelling, and Pacific oratory and performance.",

    "long_description": "A unique space to support those who are supporting others.\n\nTheme: For parents of neurodivergent children\nCare for yourself so you can care for others, by processing emotions using a gentle powerful tool called Interactive Drawing Therapy.\nParenting can often feel isolating yet many are going through similar journeys. This 4-session block course is a safe space for parents of neurodivergent children to draw out their feelings, draw out their inner guidance, and draw on each other.\n\nDates\nThis block course consists of 4 workshops:\n6.30pm-8.00pm\nThursday 13 November \u2013 Re-finding yourself\nThursday 20 November \u2013 Caring for your needs\nThursday 27 November - Self-compassion\nThursday 4 December \u2013 Seeing potential\n\nCost\n$184 total ($46 per session)\n\nIncluded in each session\nYou will be guided by Lara Phillips, a trained creative facilitator in Interactive Drawing Therapy, through drawing prompts (similar to a guided meditation or journaling) to draw out where you are at and draw out your own inner guidance. No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these workshops.\n\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a mode for wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz.\n\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing. It is not intended as therapy nor does it replace counselling, therapy, or any other medical or clinical professional help. Participants are guided to draw out where they are at, whilst drawing out their own inner resources for support and guidance.\nParticipants understand it is their own responsibility to manage their mental and physical health during sessions, to opt in and out of activities as they see fit, and make the facilitator aware if further support is required.",

This is an excellent opportunity to treat yourself to some creative fun on Friday nights!\n\nIn weeks one and two you'll learn how to work with jeweller's hard wax to create beautiful textures in metal that can be used to create amazing rings or objects. Your waxes will be sent away for casting in the metal of your choice.\n\nThen there will be a week's break before the third session, to allow time for everyone's waxes to be cast. The third session covers how to trim, clean and finish your casts, turning them into original jewellery ready to wear!\n\nMore advanced students can use these sessions to complete projects in a class setting.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are all your different types of waxes, sandpaper and courier costs.\n\nNot included are the casting and metal costs which vary from student to student depending on what sized ring they want to make and the type of metal you choose. Small castings can cost around $6.65 - $12 and might cost between $7 to $30 in metals depending on if you use red bronze, white bronze or silver.\n\nThis class is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.",

Sharon has managed to hang onto her wings and the others are still navigating life together. They re-live the past and reveal a couple of surprising secrets! But as always, the warmth of their friendship carries them through. Girls Night \u2013 The Reunion tells us that life is messy, but it\u2019s much easier to navigate with good friends.\n\nWe are lucky enough to have two of our original actors from Girls Night and Girls Night Too returning and are now looking for three more performers with strong singing voices to join them.\n\nEmail Jo at for more information and to book an audition time for SATURDAY 6 DECEMBER.\n\nShow dates are 16 - 26 April 2026\n\nCharacter descriptions:\nCarol is 50-something, confident, well dressed and likes a drink \u2013 the perpetual party girl! She was Sharon\u2019s best friend and has been married, divorced, married, divorced and married. Turns out she found the answer to marriage but didn\u2019t realise it. Well, we all kiss a lot of frogs before we find a prince\u2026Everyone knows and loves a Carol.\n\nAnita is 50-something, na\u00efve and uncensored and has had mental health issues all her life. The friends know about this but there\u2019s never been any deep discussion between them as to why this is\u2026such close friends but with hidden secrets. Her journey is like a rollercoaster. Will we find out at the reunion what Anita\u2019s secret is?\n\nKate is late 40\u2019s/early 50\u2019s and is Carol\u2019s little sister. She is quite prim and proper and a school teacher. Anita and Kate are quite close but despite issues with her sister Carol, the sisters are also close. Kate is quiet compared to the others but sticks with the friends. She is menopausal and with her hot flushes she\u2019s relying heavily on her fans! She is very determined and is definitely the kind one.\n\n\n",

You'll experience the opportunity to restore, recalibrate and realign your soul to its highest timeline for 2026 and beyond. This intimate event will have very limited capacity, to ensure a deep inward experience for all.\n\nWe will share in a sacred water ceremony with coherent water that has been structured, charged and infused with frequency- ready to be programmed with your intentions to release and shift into the new.\n\nNext, we will connect with a Triple Cone Orgonite meditation, further amplifying the Euphoria to all, energising your intentions and clearing the way for the shifts to come.\n\nWith awareness of breath and the rhythmic handpan drumming, you will gently be guided inward to begin your journey and actualize your intentions.\n\nThe heartbeat of the journey is a very special 30 year old handmade Buffalo drum from Utah, USA. Yana is the beat we move and breathe to, the guide and the gateway, the beat of Mother Earth. Allow her depth and resonance to take you to places you\u2019ve forgotten and re-introduce to you the primal heartbeat of humanity, of your humanity.\n\nAn intentional weaving of a multitude of instruments, beats and frequencies that will take you to places deep within yourself: an opportunity to explore, feel and release what no longer serves you. As we move into higher frequencies of consciousness as a collective, we are being called to clear the old- expectations, stories, beliefs, programs, conditioning and paradigms. You bring the intention and Yana will guide you into surrender, allowing all that does not serve your highest timeline to fall away.\n\nAnd as you gently re-emerge into the waking state, you'll experience the quiet and space to recalibrate and sink into the tenderness of renewal.\n\nThis journey is a sacred experience, designed to guide you through your own process. As such, this will mainly be a silent event (not social).\nContribution $55\nNameste\n\nNamaste\n\n",

You'll experience the opportunity to restore, recalibrate and realign your soul to its highest timeline for 2026 and beyond. This intimate event will have very limited capacity, to ensure a deep inward experience for all.\nWe will share in a sacred water ceremony with coherent water that has been structured, charged and infused with frequency- ready to be programmed with your intentions to release and shift into the new.\nNext, we will connect with a Triple Cone Orgonite meditation, further amplifying the Euphoria to all, energising your intentions and clearing the way for the shifts to come.\nWith awareness of breath and the rhythmic handpan drumming, you will gently be guided inward to begin your journey and actualize your intentions.\nThe heartbeat of the journey is a very special 30 year old handmade Buffalo drum from Utah, USA. Yana is the beat we move and breathe to, the guide and the gateway, the beat of Mother Earth. Allow her depth and resonance to take you to places you\u2019ve forgotten and re-introduce to you the primal heartbeat of humanity, of your humanity. \nAn intentional weaving of a multitude of instruments, beats and frequencies that will take you to places deep within yourself: an opportunity to explore, feel and release what no longer serves you. As we move into higher frequencies of consciousness as a collective, we are being called to clear the old- expectations, stories, beliefs, programs, conditioning and paradigms. You bring the intention and Yana will guide you into surrender, allowing all that does not serve your highest timeline to fall away.\nAnd as you gently re-emerge into the waking state, you'll experience the quiet and space to recalibrate and sink into the tenderness of renewal.\nThis journey is a sacred experience, designed to guide you through your own process. As such, this will mainly be a silent event (not social). We ask that you respect others by refraining from socializing in the space.\nNamaste\nMystic Creative",

His well-honed ability to work a dance floor and his eclecticism are what has got him there. A decade or so after breaking out, he\u2019s now matured as a DJ and producer to the point where he has the confidence to lead his crowd wherever he wants and they always go with him wherever he plays. Synonymous with long sets and an innate ability to read a crowd, his immediate early impact led to high-profile gigs as soon as he arrived on the scene.\nHe is now perfectly at home at places like fabric, Circoloco, WHP, Glasgow's very own Sub Club and many more alongside a who's who of the underground scene. It's almost impossible to define his sound, switching between heavy, swing-fuelled house, fizzing techno tools and twitchy minimal wig-outs. Essentially, what you get from Jasper James are stripped-back solid grooves that make people move. Releasing on labels ranging from Optimo Trax and ESP Institute through to No Art, as well as his own Mitchell Street Records imprint, the quality remains high because releases only come when James truly connects with them. With a flurry of new music currently in the pipeline, Jasper James remains as vital a presence in the underground as ever.\nJasper is more certainly one of the finest selectors in the world.\nMake an evening of it and come for a late afternoon drink or meal - and get into the groove when the beats start.\nEarly doors, early night.\nSaturday 6 December - 7pm to 1am\nLock in the date for your dose of sonic essence.\nHouse through to techno and beyond.",

And good luck with that.\n\nBuddha is a b-i-g fan of the Slow Down Movement.\n\nWhen we slow down in meditation, for example, we give ourselves the chance to absorb.\nWhen we slow down in daily life, we give ourselves the chance to respond to people, events, thoughts, etc. with wisdom and empathy.\nWe regain crucial control over our own mind and our own actions. If you feel that your world is slipping out of your control, please join us for some teachings on Buddha\u2019s advice for how to shift into a lower gear, in life and in meditation.\n\nEveryone is welcome.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nThese classes are based on Buddha\u2019s teachings on the mind, but you do not need to be a Buddhist to attend, or to benefit from them. There is no physical exercise involved and you can choose to sit either in a chair or on a cushion. These classes are suitable for all levels of experience.\n\nRegistration starts at 9:30am. This course includes a vegan, wheat-free morning tea (we cannot guarantee gluten-free).\n\n",

Because I work and hold space within a high vibrational field, everyone present is able to access, attune to, and receive these elevated frequencies too - opening a gateway to higher states of awareness and multidimensional reconnection.\nThis is a multi-layered energetic journey that will support your soul\u2019s evolution and empower you with tools to continue accessing these frequencies whenever you need them.\n\nIn Ancient Atlantean Times...\nHealing was simple.\nPeople would sit before sacred, light-infused paintings, allowing frequency, sound, and intention to restore balance and harmony.\nI\u2019m bringing this ancient practice back.\n\nJoin me for a group Healing Session in Wellington \u2022 a beautiful multidimensional experience for deep new-code absorption, renewal, and alignment. You\u2019ll sit in sacred space before my Pleiadian Portal Painting, surrounded by gentle frequency music, sipping ceremonial Kakao, and immersed in high-vibrational energy.\nEach person will receive a clearing and then be guided through a powerful meditation and activation, with time to journal and share afterwards.\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s Included in This Sacred Attunement Journey\n\u2022 Individual Galactic Clearing\nWe begin by preparing your field for higher frequencies. Each participant will receive a personal energy clearing to release stagnant or lower vibrations, supported by channeled light language to open you to deeper transformation.\n\n\u2022 Heart-Opening Kacao Ceremony\nOnce the clearing is complete, we\u2019ll share a gentle ceremonial Kacao experience to expand the heart, deepen receptivity, and create a sacred container for Pleiadian frequencies to flow through.\n\n\u201cRaise Your Vibration\u201d Pleiadian Wisdom Talk\nI\u2019ll share insights into who the Pleiadians are, their role in humanity\u2019s awakening, and how their joyous, supportive energy can help you in everyday life. You\u2019ll also receive simple, powerful tools to help you reconnect with this frequency long after our circle.\n\n\u2022 Guided Meditation & Activation\nWe journey through a deeply guided meditation supported by my Pleiadian Encoded Artwork and light language transmissions. This works on a soul level to activate deeper layers of your light body, anchor wisdom, and align you with higher frequencies. The energetic transmission continues to integrate long after the session.\n\n\u2022 Personal Angelic Attunement & Integration\nTo complete our journey, each participant will receive a personal ANGELIC attunement to anchor the frequencies received and integrate them into their unique energetic system, supporting lasting transformation and soul alignment.\n\n\u2022 Why This Circle is Unique\nThis is an intimate, boutique-style event limited to just 10 participants to ensure a deeply personal and supportive experience for everyone. Smaller groups allow me to focus the energy on each individual, maximising the depth and potency of the transformation you\u2019ll receive.\nYou will leave feeling uplifted, attuned, and supported \u2014 and with the ability to reconnect with these higher frequencies whenever you need.\nTo help extend and nurture the energy beyond the circle, supportive tools will be available and to order - including aura sprays, light-encoded scarves, and art prints, so you can continue to connect with and access the Pleiadian frequencies in your own space.\n\nEvent Details\nDate: Sunday, 7 December 2025\nLocation: Whitby, Wellington (address supplied upon booking)\nTime: 4:00 PM \u2013 6:00 PM\nExchange: NZ$65\nMaximum Group: 10 participants only \u2014 early booking is recommended.\n\n",

You\u2019ll leave not only with a stylish, wearable ring stack, but also with the joy of having made something truly unique with your own hands.\n\nThis class is perfect for beginners, groups of friends, or visitors wanting a memorable creative experience. Many students find jewellery making a wonderfully mindful activity - slowing down, working with their hands and enjoying the calming rhythm of making.\n\nYour class fee includes copper and brass for practice, sterling silver for two rings, plus all consumables such as solder, sandpaper and polishing materials. Extra silver and other metals are available for purchase in the studio if you\u2019d like to expand your collection.\n\nChildren aged 12 and up are welcome, though anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.",

It is a great chance to support young talent, enjoy beautiful images and be part of a welcoming creative community.\nBring your friends and wh\u0101nau.

She believes that sound vibration holds the power to expand consciousness and restore harmony and balance in our lives. Her journey into sound healing began with the realization of how deeply sound vibration was affecting her psyche\u2014making her more mindful of the music she listens to and the intention it carries. Along the way, she has drawn inspiration from artists such as Deva Premal, The Flying Mystics, Stevin McNamara, and the Bhakti Lounge Kirtan. Their music has profoundly influenced her own sound healing practice, inspiring her to explore sound as a tool for transformation, connection, and inner peace.",

Return could therefore either be 1:30 or 2:30 with the latest return to Titahi Bay being 3pm.\n\nWe've made this event later than the normal SKISL so that it's easier for folks to drive down from Palmerston North, and also because it is a lunch event.\n\nThe lawn on Mana is really nice, sheltered and pleasant and there are also good walks. Mana is of course a sanctuary so you must check your boats for any wildlife especially ants that may have gotten in past the hatches. Also we cannot have any fires\n\nPlan B: If weather nukes Mana, we'll try for Green Point or Onehunga Bay in Whitireia Park by driving there.\n\nPlan C: We will postpone to 21 December\n\nAlso check out other Workshops in Porirua.",

    "long_description": "Somatic: Of or relating to the body, particularly the perception of physical sensations and internal experiences\n\nWhat does it feel like to exist in a queer body? This workshop aims to help sapphic women and gender minorities find joy, freedom, and connection through somatic exercises that help you embody and embrace your queerness. You will leave feeling confident in your ability to take up space, tapped into your self-expression, and connected to the experiences of your sapphic community.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of what to expect:\n- Opening Exercise: Guided somatic movements to loosen up your body\n- Community Connection: Rotating conversations with other participants about queer embodiment\n- Yoga Flow: Creative 30 minute class to explore presence and connect to your self-expression\n- Guided Meditation: A relaxing combination of breathwork and visualisation to cultivate safety in your body\n- Closing Connection: Gentle and grounding partner stretches (optional) and group reflections\n\nNo prior experience with yoga or somatic exercises necessary! All you need to attend is an open attitude, a desire to connect with your body, and a willingness to share your experience with other sapphics. Yoga mats and all other props will be provided. While this workshop dives into your embodied expression of sapphic identity/sexuality, none of the content is sexual in nature and the small amount of physical touch with other participants is completely optional.\n\nThe workshop is facilitated by Megan Edwards, creator of Golden Hour Gigs and a 500CYT trauma-informed yoga teacher. This event is intended specifically for queer women and gender minorities. No TERFS no SWERFS.\n\nContent consideration: Because this workshop focuses on finding joy/pleasure/freedom in your body, it might not be suited for anyone experiencing intense dysphoria. With that said, you are welcome to explore discomfort and work on integrating challenging feelings. Megan is trained in movement techniques to lead you away from anything too activating and help you find safety in your body.\n\nAccessibility: Awhi Yoga Studios has an elevator and is wheelchair accessible. There are plenty of gender neutral bathrooms and cosy spaces to rest if you need a break from the workshop at any time. If you want to attend but are concerned about the level of movement required, please email the organiser with any mobility questions at goldenhourgigz@gmail.com",

Saturday 13th of December, the band will take the stage at Auckland\u2019s glorious Hollywood Avondale for an all-ages show, playing Meow in Wellington on Sunday 14th December.\n\nAfter bursting onto the scene with two incredible albums in a single year - the brilliant Tracey Denim and the noisy niceness of The Twits - bar italia spent the next while earning a reputation as one of the best live bands in the game, including a sold out and sweaty show at Auckland\u2019s Neck of the Woods. Since then, the band have been plotting their next move in world domination, dropping fan favourite single Cowbella in June, and this week lifting the lid on Some Like It Hot with accompanying tune Fundraiser - with a video featuring Matt \u201cSuper Hans\u201d King.\n\nThe London based band, built around the core of Nina Cristante, Jezmi Tarik Fehmi and Sam Fenton, may have looked to be hiding out this year while cooking up this new batch of tunes, but in reality they\u2019ve been anything but dormant. Cristante teamed up with Yves Tumor for a dangerously good duet on We Don\u2019t Count, while Jezmi and Sam dropped another full-length album under their Double Virgo moniker just last month.\n\nWith the album dropping on Matador this October, local fans will have a couple of short months to learn the words and get ready to scream and swoon along when bar italia hit our shores this December. Shit yeah!\n\n",

Please contact them directly to enquire islandbay@compassion.org.nz\nSCHEDULE\nSaturday, 17th of January: This first part of the retreat will be at the Island Bay Presbyterian Church.

The focus is on camping, coffee, and having a fun time with relatively short kayaking times on the water.\n\nThe schedule for Wellingtonians is: on the Thursday 29th Ferry over to Picton, in at 12:30, launch from Picton beach head over to Kumoto, tents up, Friday - paddle around the Bay of Many Coves, stop for coffee / lunch / chips / shower at Punga Cove, stay at Camp Bay. Maybe a quick trip over to Bumine Island with empty boats. Saturday night at Ratimira for camping / snoozing. Sunday - up early, on water at 8am, paddle back to Picton in by 12, lunch, on 1pm sailing. So 4 days with Blumine as an optional paddle, mostly shortish trips. We might shift the plan around depending on the weather, but that sets out the general plan.\n\nFor the ferry you need to book your own tickets and I would urge you to get your ferry tickets now as they go fast. If you are concerned about the weather get the fully refundable tickets. When you buy your ticket select the \"kayak\" option. Any questions ask them in the comments below.\n\nAlso check out other Trips & Adventurous Activities in Wellington.",

    "long_description": "Acclaimed experimental metal trio finally make their New Zealand debut in January 2026, with dates booked for Auckland & Wellington\nBanished Music, Whammy Bar, and Valhalla are proud to present the long-awaited New Zealand debut of experimental post-metal trio SUMAC.\nFormed in 2014, the powerhouse trio comprised of Aaron Turner (guitar, vocals; Isis, Old Man Gloom), Brian Cook (bass; Russian Circles, Botch), and Nick Yacyshyn (drums; Baptists) are renowned for merging crushing heaviness with improvisational freedom, exploring the boundaries between structure and chaos. \n\nSUMAC have built a reputation as a fearsome live band. Visceral and cathartic shows where crushing riffs & sprawling drones collide with extended bursts of wild improvisation. In 2024, the band released their critically acclaimed album The Healer, a sweeping, transformative work spanning four monumental tracks. The record dives deep into themes of regeneration, suffering, and spiritual reconstruction \u2014 a testament to the band\u2019s ability to meld raw power with emotional depth.\n\nThe experimental metal trio\u2019s four-song, 76-minute album is the peak of their career. It\u2019s dense and invigorating, highlighting the band\u2019s dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. - Pitchfork\n\nSoon after the release SUMAC teamed up with poet and sound artist Moor Mother to release The Film, a boundary-pushing collaborative album. Released via Thrill Jockey in April 2025, the record unfolds as a cinematic journey across eight \u201cscenes,\u201d merging SUMAC\u2019s heavy, jazz-inflected textures with Moor Mother\u2019s incisive spoken-word commentary. \n\nSUMAC\u2019s work has always been about transition between different states of being. Our sense of normal, and indeed our sense of life, is now being shaken. We don\u2019t know what is coming next. We are looking for pointers towards the future, as well as things to hold onto in the moment. \nNew Zealanders, don\u2019t miss this rare and powerful journey into uncharted sonic terrain.",

He has since gone on to write for film and television and produce multi-million-selling albums. His most recent is \u2018The Summer Portraits\u2019. Written in 2025, it is the result of a cascade of personal memories triggered by sun, summer, and family holidays. Here, he returns to the lush full-band textures of earlier works.

    "long_description": "UNLEASH THE VOICES OF YOUR SUN AND MOON\nBook Soon for this special day workshop and explore and unleash the power of your Voice and Astrological Archetypes!!\n\nWe are blessed that Alignment Coach and Healer, Clare Babbage is visiting the Wellington Region from Napier, and collaborating with Voice Empowerment Coach and Healer, Bryony Rogers from Heartsong Healing, in this exciting, unique offering.\n\nThis workshop is a specially designed, transformative full day experience of Embodied Astrological Archetypes and Conscious Sound and Voice Practices.\n\nBOOK HERE - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nOn the date of the full moon, the energies of the sun and the moon stand face to face \u2014 illuminating both our outer expression and our inner world.\n\nIn astrology, the sun represents our fullest expression, our vitality, and the way we are here to shine. The moon reveals our emotional landscape, our inner rhythms, and often the fears that arise when we dare to live that full expression. Together, they form a powerful dialogue between structure and flow, logic and emotion, masculine and feminine.\n\nIn this workshop, Clare will guide you into an embodied exploration of your own sun and moon, inviting you to feel these two archetypes within your body and notice where they support, resist, or balance each other.\n\nBryony will lead you into vocal practices that bring these energies into sound and voice \u2014 giving expression to what is often left unspoken. Through voice, you\u2019ll release what holds you back and discover new harmony between your inner and outer selves.\n\nThis full moon is the perfect moment to unleash the voices of your sun and moon \u2014 and to step more fully into clarity, balance, and authentic expression.\n\nThe timing of this workshop gives you a unique opportunity to tune into these planets and benefit from their placement in the collective astrology.\n\nThe workshop will begin with the opportunity to explore powerful, enjoyable, accessible Voice Practices which open, align and strengthen your expression - and create physiological changes in your energy field.\n\nWe will then directly, bodily experience the energies of each of the Celestial Bodies through Embodied Astrology, guided by Clare.\n\nWe will integrate these energies, through further Voice Practices, including improvisation, healing chants and songs.\n\nThese two modalities will be carefully interwoven in an enjoyable, rich day's workshop that will benefit all participants.\n\nThere will be guided space in the workshop to integrate the energetic shifts and discoveries of both the Voice Practices and the Astrology.\n\nThis special workshop takes place on Saturday February 7th, 10am-4.30pm - we hope you can join us\n\nAt the Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Paraparaumu.\n\nINVESTMENT:\n\nYour investment for this day is $233. Shared lunch.\nSome concessions are available - please contact us by email .\n\nPayment by card here - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nPlease contact us with any questions at all.\n\n",

    "long_description": "On the 12 February 1909, the SS Penguin sank in Cook Strait in a raging southerly storm with the loss of 72 lives, one of the worst maritime disasters in NZ history.  Many of those who died were woman and children, as their lifeboats capsized in the wild sea. \nAlthough the Captain was heavily criticised, it is still not clear what the ship hit nor where, as the wreck of the Penguin has never been located. \nThe tragedy stunned Wellington and a day of mourning was called for 16 February.  The city came to a standstill as many of those who died were brought up to Karori Cemetery for burial in a long procession of cabs and lorries.\nTo commemorate this tragedy the Friends will be undertaking a guided tour of most of the Penguin graves on Sunday 8th February. \nThe tour duration is approximately 2 hours long.\nThis tour is suitable for people with moderate fitness. The route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. Surefootedness is required.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee). Children under 12 are free.\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nNote:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you one hour before the tour start time by email and on our Facebook page. The booking fee is non-refundable.\nPlease dress appropriately for the conditions. While we do our best to guide you on a safe walking route, during the winter months the ground can become slippery in places.\nSome of our walks require a moderate degree of fitness and are not suited for those with limited mobility. Please read the tour descriptions carefully to check that they will be suitable for you.\nThere is only one toilet which is located by the cemetery office at the main entrance.\nPlease meet us at the shelter (shown as the Historic Chapel on the map at the main entrance)\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Karori Cemetery.",

    "long_description": "STEAMS is an integrated approach to learning topics of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths, and Society that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. Its aim is to teach real world skills through engaging methods whilst allowing individuals to be creative. This involves immersing tamariki into projects and activities that develop innovation and champion curiosity. STEAMS is not \u2018play based learning\u2019 but focused learning through an integrated hands-on approach allowing children to take risks and explore their own curiosity in a subject without time barriers.\nAt the Ministry of Inspiration we offer STEAMS learning each term for Year 1-8 students. Once a week students will attend a class at Waterlea Racecourse, Blenheim on TUESDAY or THURSDAY. STEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) start at 9am and finish at 2:45pm on TUESDAY. Little STEAMerS operates from 9-12 on THURSDAY. STEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) operates on THURSDAY from 9am to 245 pm. \nInquiry, collaboration, and an emphasis on process-based learning are at the heart of the STEAM approach. Each term the classes will have a focus which drives the learning and our amazing teachers create opportunities to help each student develop their understanding, improve their skills and gain knowledge in a range of topics.\nStudents who participate in STEAM learning:\n\u00b7 think outside the box\n\u00b7 feel safe to express innovative and creative ideas\n\u00b7 feel comfortable doing hands-on learning\n\u00b7 take ownership over their learning\n\u00b7 work collaboratively with others\n\u00b7 understand the ways that science, maths, the arts, and technology work together\n\u00b7 become increasingly curious about the world around them and feel empowered to change it for the better.\nWhen does it meet, and where?\nThe school is held during school terms.\nSTEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) TUESDAY, 9-245.\nSTEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) THURSDAY, 9-245\nLittle STEAMerS (ages 5-6) THURSDAY 12-3.\nLocation:  Waterlea Racecourse, enter off of Linton St.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe students come for a paid three-week trial-as a new student you pay for that through Humanitix.\nIf both family and teacher feel there is a good fit for the child in the class, they continue for the rest of the term. You are then invoiced for the full term less the amount paid for the Trial.\nPayment is by term, with a cost of $73 incl. GST We have a limited number of scholarships available that are awarded on a term by term basis for those with financial need for 25% off. \nLittle STEAMerS is $30 incl. GST.\nWill my child\u2019s school mind that they miss a day per week?\nYou will need to inform the child\u2019s school that he or she will be at STEAMS School one day per week. To date we have not encountered any issues around accommodating a child\u2019s participation in STEAMS School, and many of the region\u2019s schools are very supportive of the programme. Once enrolled, you are encouraged to inform the teacher and office staff that your child should be marked present for the day they attend STEAMS School, as they will be attending an academic school as opposed to being absent due to illness or other reasons.",

    "long_description": "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention initially developed for emotional disorders. It is now widely used in supporting people to deal with the challenges of physical ill-health. Professionals from various backgrounds can learn to use a simplified CBT skills set, and use of these skills enables them to be more effective in managing aspects of their patients\u2019 distress.\nThe training is a mix of theory, skills demonstration and skills practice, giving participants a better understanding of the applicability of the skill set in their area of practice and providing some skills to take away. Training sessions are spaced to allow participants to use their new skills in their clinical practice. Each participant reflects on their learning and their work with a specific patient, and the whole group reflects on lessons learned. In this way, learning remains rooted in participants\u2019 clinical practice. These CBT courses are consistently evaluated highly by participants.\nThe Course\nTeaching will be commenced with 2 days of in person sessions. 19th and 20th Feb 2026 at Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington and subsequently 2 sessions on-line via Zoom. These will be either 18th or 19th March an 22nd or 23rd April 2026.\nAttendance at all sessions is mandatory to complete the course.\nThe courses cost is $850 per person (incl GST).\nThe Trainers\nKathy Burn was a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Palliative Care who went on to train in CBT and to develop the CBT service at St Christopher\u2019s Hospice, London. She now works in CBT in chronic pain, and she teaches and supervises CBT trainees at the institute of Psychiatry, London.\nKathryn Mannix was a Palliative Medicine Consultant and CBT therapist. She developed \u2018CBT First Aid\u2019 to enable palliative care clinicians to adapt skills from CBT into their clinical practice. She is an author. There are insights into her use of CBT in her books With the End in Mind and Listen.\nTerms and Conditions\nAttendance: In order to create a learning community for each course, it is important that each person on a course attends every session and is able to join in the discussions by keeping up with the course. By accepting a place on a particular course, you agree to attend all the sessions, to arrive on time, and to work alongside your group members during the session to support each other's learning. Each session builds on the last, and you'll be asked to put your new learning into practice in- between sessions. Building learning groups in this way means we can't add new trainees after a course has begun.\nWe are not able to run catch-up sessions for sessions missed. If you miss sessions, you may be asked to withdraw from the course and no refunds will be given.\nRefunds/Canellations: Once you sign up and pay, we won't be able to refund your payment unless we can reallocate your place to another person before the course begins. The deadline for cancelling your place is 28 days before the day and time of the first session. If you cancel and we can fill your place with another person, we'll offer you the choice of a refund or a place on a future course, if places are available. We will do our best to fill your place, but we can't promise this. Refunds will incur an administration fee.\nDates and Times of Sessions: all dates and times are given in NZ time, and this varies over the year. It is up to you to check the correct time in your time zone: you may find this website useful to check your own time zone with Auckland NZ time on each specific date: https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/\nTrainers: we have a team of trainers, all of whom are experienced CBT therapists and trainers, and all are familiar with applying CBT in physical health settings. Different sessions may be taught by different trainers, or by 'guest appearances' by some of our team. The team of trainers will ensure there is continuity of content and of learning as the course progresses.\nSpecial circumstances: Sometimes, life events appear unexpectedly. If something unexpected prevents you from attending, please let us know as early as you can, and we will give consideration to how we might be able to support you to continue your training if that is what you wish to do.",

All proceeds are then donated to a charity that's helps out the community (this years charity is yet to be determined). This helps out the community fourfold. People get to declutter, people get what they need at a a very low price, a charity gets a financial donation and we reduce the items going to the landfill.\nWe will start collecting items for the garage sale from the 7th of January so if you have something you believe would be suitable flick us an email with photos to .

Her practice centres her ancestral river, Waiapu, exploring how \"lens-based practice can contribute to iwi-based aspirations for environmental reinvigoration\".\nAcross a series of discussions with Aotearoa photographers, we will explore key threads in contemporary practice \u2014 including collaboration, process, and evolving photographic culture \u2014 offering insights into the ideas and relationships that shape photography today. We'll close the day in the galleries, with a performance of photographer Ann Shelton\u2019s work The physical garden.\nOpen to photographers, curators, researchers, students, and anyone with an interest in photography, this event invites participants to connect, reflect, and share.\nTickets $60 (waged) / $40 (unwaged) with lunch included.\nAssisted listening\nAn assisted listening system is available for this event.

Voices New Zealand debuted with a concert at the same festival in 1998. It has gone on to build a reputation for excellence in the music world. For this celebratory concert, the choir is joined by taonga p\u016boro artist Horomona Horo, leading instrumentalists, and a chamber ensemble from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. \nThe concert centrepiece is Robert Wiremu\u2019s Re-imagined Mozart: Erebus. The programme also features a new commission from Takerei Komene, as well as waiata by Ng\u0101p\u014d and Pimia Wehi. This highlights Dr Grylls\u2019 pioneering collaborations that reshaped Aotearoa\u2019s choral landscape. Her expertise as a choral clinician is sought internationally, and she regularly conducts masterclasses and workshops in Wales, England, North America, Canada and Australia. \nThis marks Dr Grylls\u2019 final appearance as Music Director of Voices New Zealand. It\u2019s a rare opportunity to celebrate her vision, artistry, and legacy.",

The performance will also feature a selection of hits and best-loved songs spanning the artist\u2019s extraordinary 31-year career.   \nThis is the only leg of the \u2018Red Sunset\u2019 tour featuring orchestra, so expect the songs to be transformed by the powerful accompaniment.

Over her career, she has won 20 T\u016b\u012b awards \u2014 the most for an Aotearoa solo artist, including Best Female Vocalist four times. \nA New Zealand Order of Merit recipient for services to music.

Playing Wellington\u2019s San Fran on Saturday 11 April, followed by The Powerstation in Auckland on Sunday 12 April. \nTickets on sale Thursday 2 October 12pm from helmetmusic.com\nHelmet has built a reputation as one of the most commanding forces in the underground scene. Born at the dawn of the rage-filled 90\u2019s, Helmet fiercely holds space for multiple generations of alternative fans seeking the vital energy of hostile riffs and inventive metronomic groove. With a refusal to fit neatly into a genre, Helmet\u2019s music creates an atmosphere best known live; part industrial, part hip-hop, part existential sermon. \n\nFormed in 1989 in NYC by Page Hamilton, Helmet has been crushing stages for over three decades. In that time they have only come to Aotearoa / NZ a handful of times, most recently in 2023 during their sold out Best of Helmet 1989-2023 tour, with 13th Floor declaring \u201ca complete evening of essential music from one of heavy music\u2019s most essential bands.\u201d With 35 years of rocking behind them, Helmet are at the top of their game.

Born at the dawn of the rage-filled 90\u2019s, Helmet fiercely holds space for multiple generations of alternative fans seeking the vital energy of hostile riffs and inventive metronomic groove. With a refusal to fit neatly into a genre, Helmet\u2019s music creates an atmosphere best known live; part industrial, part hip-hop, part existential sermon.\n\n\"Helmet stripped away the excess, dialled in the precision, and redefined what heaviness could sound like without succumbing to clich\u00e9s.\" Pitchfork\n\nFormed in 1989 in NYC by Page Hamilton, Helmet has been crushing stages for over three decades. In that time they have only come to Aotearoa / NZ a handful of times, most recently in 2023 during their sold out Best of Helmet 1989-2023 tour, with 13th Floor declaring \u201ca complete evening of essential music from one of heavy music\u2019s most essential bands.\u201d With 35 years of rocking behind them, Helmet are at the top of their game.\n\nDon\u2019t miss Helmet in New Zealand next April.\n\nTickets on sale Thursday 2 October, 12pm\n\n",

    "long_description": "Day 1 \u2013 May 10, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: Working with Dissociative Parts and Their Voices in Complex Trauma and Dissociative Disorders\nOverview:\nThis seminar focuses on adapting EMDR for individuals with dissociative disorders, using the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) Dolores has developed. It provides strategies for working with dissociative parts and their voices and integrating a trauma-informed approach to inner conflict safely from early treatment stages.\nKey Learning Points:\n\u00b7         Identifying and working with dissociative parts and their voices.\n\u00b7         Understanding the function and purpose of \u201chostile\u201d parts.\n\u00b7         Addressing dissociative phobias through EMDR informed techniques.\n\u00b7         Managing resistance and treatment impasses.\n\u00b7         Structuring work with dissociative parts effectively.\nProgram Description:\nAfter many early cautions about the potential dangers of using EMDR with individuals suffering from dissociative disorders, limited methods have been offered for adapting standard EMDR procedures to this specific population. Based on these early cautions, EMDR is still considered by many clinicians as limited to the treatment of traumatic memories in high-functioning dissociative clients and only after a long preparation phase that depends on other treatment modalities. Confined by this conceptualisation, the use of EMDR is too often limited, and many survivors of severe traumatisation are unable to benefit from EMDR reprocessing and, if at all, only much later in the treatment process.\nDolores Mosquera developed (with AnabelGonzalez, M.D.) the Progressive Approach model for treating complex trauma and dissociation (2012) and the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) (2019, 2025). Using this trauma and AIP-informed models, clinicians can safely utilise a wide range of EMDR interventions (including BLS) from early in the preparatory phase of treatment for patients with dissociative disorders.\nIn this seminar, she will present her current practice of working with clients, including video demonstrations. Mosquera's deft clinical skills and ground-breaking innovative thinking teach a middle ground between \"dissociation blind\" aggressive EMDR interventions and overly cautious delays to the use of EMDR reprocessing.\nMany dissociative clients have difficulty with hostile, critical voices. The internal conflict is sometimes so intense that the person even has difficulty carrying on an ordinary conversation. One factor that affects this conflict is how the patient deals with the voices or parts of the self.\nKey Program Content:\nIdentify the internal system of dissociation and internal voices that are hostile and critical\nHow to read the function and purpose behind the saboteur parts of self\nUsing compassion and understanding to help deal with dissociative phobias within the internal system\nSkills to reduce impasses and resistance that may complicate or reduce the efficacy of the treatment\nSpecific steps to organize the work with hostile parts and voices\n Days 2\u20133 \u2013 May 11\u201312, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: From Fragmentation to Integration: A Master Class in Treating Complex Trauma and Dissociation\nFormat: 2-Day Masterclass: Three Clinical Cases from Start to Finish\nAcross two days, Dolores will present three distinct new cases illustrating varying levels of dissociation \u2014 including one with frequent switching and no initial Adult Self. Each session is interactive, highlighting the therapeutic process from assessment to completion.\nOver two immersive days, this advanced master class offers a rare opportunity to observe and analyse complete therapeutic processes under the expert guidance of Dolores Mosquera.\n\nDolores will present three new and distinct clinical cases, each representing different manifestations of complex trauma and dissociation \u2014 including one client who experiences frequent switching and begins therapy without an integrated adult self.\nParticipants will follow these clients\u2019 journeys from the initial stages of therapy through to treatment completion, gaining deep insight into decision-making, pacing, and the integration of EMDR strategies within complex systems. The format is designed to be highly interactive and reflective, combining video demonstrations, live commentary, and group discussion to deepen understanding of safe, flexible, and attuned clinical practice when working with dissociative clients.\nThis master class is ideal for clinicians seeking to refine their skills, expand their conceptual framework, and enhance clinical confidence when navigating the challenges of trauma-related dissociation.\nAdditional Details\n\u00b7         Eligibility: Must have completed at least Part One of EMDR Basic Training (University of Otago or equivalent).\n\u00b7         Certification: Participants receive a Professional Development Certificate of Attendance.\n\u00b7         Dietary needs: Provided upon registration.\n\u00b7         Parking: Paid on-site parking available.\n\u00b7         Accommodation: Discounted rates at a local hotel (discount code to be posted on the event site).",
    "description": "Day 1 \u2013 May 10, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm) Topic: Working with Dissociative Parts and Their Voices in Complex Trauma and Dissociative Disorders Overview: This seminar focuses on adapting EMDR for individuals with dissociative disorders, using the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) Dolores has developed.\nIt provides strategies for working with dissociative parts and their voices and integrating a trauma-informed approach to inner conflict safely from early treatment stages.\nProgram Description: After many early cautions about the potential dangers of using EMDR with individuals suffering from dissociative disorders, limited methods have been offered for adapting standard EMDR procedures to this specific population.\nConfined by this conceptualisation, the use of EMDR is too often limited, and many survivors of severe traumatisation are unable to benefit from EMDR reprocessing and, if at all, only much later in the treatment process.\nKey Program Content: Identify the internal system of dissociation and internal voices that are hostile and critical How to read the function and purpose behind the saboteur parts of self Using compassion and understanding to help deal with dissociative phobias within the internal system Skills to reduce impasses and resistance that may complicate or reduce the efficacy of the treatment Specific steps to organize the work with hostile parts and voices Days 2\u20133 \u2013 May 11\u201312, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm) Topic: From Fragmentation to Integration: A Master Class in Treating Complex Trauma and Dissociation Format: 2-Day Masterclass: Three Clinical Cases from Start to Finish Across two days, Dolores will present three distinct new cases illustrating varying levels of dissociation \u2014 including one with frequent switching and no initial Adult Self."

    "long_description": "Meet Getdown Services \u2013 your new favourite band and one of the UK\u2019s hottest word-of-mouth acts! The brilliantly offbeat cult British duo has been turning heads across Britain and Europe with their balls-to-the-walls live shows, tongue-in-cheek wit, razor-sharp lyrics and infectious disco-fuelled grooves, teetering between chaos and genius. And now, after selling out tours across the UK and Europe, they\u2019re bringing their riotous show down under for the first time in May/June 2026 \u2013 with shows in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Wellington, presented by I OH YOU and MG Live. \nTickets go on sale Friday 14 November at 10.00am local time, with MG Live presale commencing Thursday 13 November at 10.00am local time. Sign up for early access to the MG Live presale here.               \n\u201cI reckon we get people asking us to come to Australia probably every day, and everyone in England is moving there, so will be good to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\u201cAlways been one of those places where you\u2019re like, \u2018Fair enough, but I can\u2019t be arsed with that. It looks mad \u2013 there\u2019s snakes and also it takes 40 hours to get there.\u2019 Will be good fun, though! Went to New Zealand to see a mate of ours get married a few years ago and thought it was a lovely country and I really liked those pies they have. It felt quite similar to the UK in a lot of ways, so playing gigs there should be fun!\u201d\nGetdown Services\n\nFor those in the know, Bristol-based duo Josh Law and Ben Sadler \u2013 aka Getdown Services \u2013 are THE must-see new act of the year. And if you don\u2019t know yet, you will soon \u2026 and you\u2019ll wish you got in early! Named as \u201cone to watch\u201d at this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival and dubbed (by the band themselves) \u201cBritain\u2019s Best Band\u201d, their live shows are equal parts smart, sweaty and gloriously unhinged. Their sound is a wild blend of scrappy indie disco, twisted funk and post-punk energy, turning the absurdity of modern Britain into dancefloor gold.        \n \nThe pair met at school in Minehead, Somerset and now make music together at home in Bristol \u2013 churning out what Rolling Stone called \u201cpower disco with unrepentant silliness\u201d with a healthy dose of satire and swagger. Their highly lauded debut album Crisps (Breakfast Records, 2023) showcased their eclectic danceable grooves and biting social commentary, and a mix of sharp, funny social observations wrapped in irresistible, funk-fuelled rhythms. Follow-up EPs Your Medal\u2019s In The Post, Crumbs and latest, Primordial Slot Machine, cemented their cult status, alongside an arsenal of red-hot singles \u2013 including James Bay\u2019s Hat, Dog Dribble, I Got Views and Eat Quiche, Sleep, Repeat.   \n \n \u201cGetdown Services are unrepentantly silly and constantly deliver one of the most joyously deranged live shows \u2013 just one of the best live bands out there!\u201d\n Rolling Stone\n\u201cTheir live show is as daft and as exhilarating as they come. Five stars.\u201d\n Buzz Magazine\n \n \u201cGenuine contenders to being the most exciting and interesting band in the UK right now.\u201d\n CLASH\n\n Getdown Services look set to gobble up the world, one crumb at a time. Whether you\u2019re into danceable chaos, satirical genius or just want to be ahead of the curve, Getdown Services are the band you didn\u2019t know you needed \u2013 until now! Britain\u2019s favourite new band are about to become yours too! \n\nMG LIVE TERMS OF SALE\n\nhttps://mg.live/termsofsale",

Emergence is the latest show by English physicist, presenter, and personality Professor Brian Cox. He takes to the stage at TSB Arena to contemplate the dazzling complexity of the universe and how it\u2019s built on profoundly simple principles. \nEmergence is also a scientific history of 400 years of human discovery. How did we come to understand so much about the cosmos? Guided by mathematics, curiosity, and an aesthetic sense of symmetry, our species has begun to read the story of the Universe. We\u2019ve started to carry our spacecraft to the edge of the solar system and outwards to the stars. Brian\u2019s engaging style makes these questions come to life. The audience will be left awestruck and thrilled as the show covers vast topics in an accessible way. \nBrian has appeared in many landmark science programs for BBC radio and television over the last 15 years, from the Peabody Award-winning Wonders of the Solar System to the worldwide hit series The Planets. His previous touring show, Horizons, was performed to nearly half a million people across the world.",

New Zealand Opera\u2019s production in 2026 promises to bring the 240-year-old masterpiece to life in a sumptuous setting. \nPicking up narratively where The Barber of Seville left off, The Marriage of Figaro is renowned for its wit and musical sophistication. It follows Figaro and his bride-to-be, Susannah, on their wedding day. Figaro\u2019s employer, Count Almaviva, tries to seduce Susanna, so the engaged couple seek revenge. The cast boasts an unbelievable wealth of talent from Aotearoa and Australia, including runner-up at the 2022 Lexus Song Quest Felicity Tompkins, Julien Van Mellaerts, and James Clayton. \nTrans-Tasman creative duo Lindy Hume and Tracy Grant Lord take the helm with direction and design while Orchestra Wellington and conductor James Judd lead from the pit. This season offers opera at its most gorgeous, its most vivid, its most unforgettable.",

    "long_description": "After three years of closure, the newly renovated and strengthened City Gallery Wellington Te Whare Toi will host the art of Cornelia Parker. The English visual artist is best known for her innovative and contemporary sculpture and installation art. Her large-scale, immersive installations explore themes of destruction and reconstruction, transformation and metamorphosis. Objects are exploded, crushed, and suspended in a world upended and remade anew.\nCurated by independent UK-based curator Andrea Schlieker and City Gallery Wellington\u2019s Senior Curator Aaron Lister, City Gallery Wellington's exhibition will encompass Parker\u2019s long career as an artist. This includes an immersive sound and light installation, \u2018Stolen Thunder\u2019. The work gathers the sounds of approaching storms from around the globe and across time. The exhibition will also showcase her paintings, photos, films, and sculptures.\n\u201cI have always said this is the one exhibition I want to do before I die,\u201d said Charlotte Davy, Ringatohu Toi Director Art and City Gallery Wellington. \u201cI have been following Cornelia Parker\u2019s work for the last twenty years. Bringing her mischievous, dark, and literally explosive work to Wellington is incredible.\u201d \nParker\u2019s work often fills entire rooms and invites the viewer to move through and around the art. Given its physical scale, the blank canvas of the reopened gallery offers the perfect opportunity to host the exhibition. The exhibition will kick off in October 2026, carrying through to March 2027. \nCharlotte notes the exhibition\u2019s themes are also of particular relevance to Wellington. \u201cI hope that the exhibition and our return to Te Ng\u0101kau Civic Square will reflect our city and also help remake it. We are looking forward to opening with a bang.\u201d\nHero image: \u00a9 Cornelia Parker. Courtesy of the artist and Frith Street Gallery, London",

    "long_description": "Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",
