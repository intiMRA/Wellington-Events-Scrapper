    "description": "Premiere production of D.H.Lawrence\u2019s The Fox adapted for the stage by Keith Scott, Dunedin playwright. Directed by Annabel Hensley\n\nIt is 1918, immediately after the armistice which ended the Great War. Two women struggle to run a small farm in rural England and are moderately content. Their comfortable, albeit unfulfilling lives, are disrupted by two visitors. A fox has begun to take their hens and a young soldier arrives. These seemingly unrelated events combine and clash with unexpected consequences. The play explores the dynamics of power play when instincts are triggered that are as old as life itself.\n\nThe play explores gender roles, sexuality, femininity, and the pity of war, with Scott\u2019s adaptation maintaining the authenticity of Lawrence\u2019s original work."

    "description": "Maven Theatre Company, in partnership with Te Raukura ki Kapiti, proudly presents the New Zealand premiere of The Ballad of Maria Marten, an innovative reimagining of the infamous \u2018Red Barn Murder\u2019 of 1827.\n\nMaven\u2019s inaugural offering, The Ballad of Maria Marten explores the notorious \u2018Red Barn Murder\u2019 of 1827 which has become a part of British folklore and the subject of sensational gossip and grim speculation. A young woman named Maria Marten went to a barn in Suffolk to meet her lover with plans to elope. A year later, her body was discovered hidden beneath the floor. What is the truth behind her murder? Why was she killed? And who was responsible?\n\nRather than providing a literal retelling of this historic true crime, the play offers a thrilling reappraisal that focuses on Maria\u2019s life. It celebrates the solidarity among female friendships and highlights the stark realities that young working -class women in rural areas faced, including limited choices due to their gender, social class, and lack of education. Through a mix of storytelling, dance, and humor, Maria's fate is explored through the eyes of the women who loved her, illuminating a complex narrative of love, loss, prejudice, and patriarchal power.\n\nJoin us for this thrilling New Zealand premiere, where historical crime meets contemporary theatre, and Maria Marten\u2019s story is told through the eyes of the women who loved her.\n\nMaven is the newest theatre company on the Kapiti Coast and was born from a passion for bold storytelling and a commitment to creating immersive, thought-provoking theatre that challenges conventions. Maven was formed by Sera Devcich and Jessica Clough, the creative team behind the extended sold-out season of Nick Dear\u2019s Frankenstein on the Kapiti Coast last year. That production received numerous accolades at the Wellington District Theatre Federation Awards, including Best Drama and Best Overall - a first for any production from Kapiti. The overwhelming feedback received from patrons was a desire to see more locally produced, ambitious, meaningful, and expertly crafted theatre. And so, Maven was established.\n\nContent Advisory: This play contains adult themes and some content that may disturb. Recommended for audiences 16+\n\n--\n\nFor accessibility seating information and wheelchair space bookings please email kiaora@teraukura.nz or call 04)9740535 during office hours."

Willum is thrilled when Rick shows up unexpectedly for his 39th birthday, but his delight quickly fades as Rick is a hopeless nerd \u2013 a bumbling idiot with no social sense, little emotional intelligence, and even less tact.  Rick moves in and stays on and on, his continued presence among Willum and his friends creates unimaged chaos, until the normally placid Willum can no longer take it and he and his friends devise an insane plan to finally get Rick to leave.\nDon\u2019t miss this hilarious farce that ran on Broadway for 441 performances and went on to be performed the world over.\nPerformance dates: 12 & 16-19 July 2025, 7.30pm, Muritai School Hall, Eastbourne"

Armed with new releases and a reckless lack of MIDI cables, longtime pals Synthetic Children and Diesel Jenny are packing gear into the whip for a trip up and down the motu.\nThe six-date tour will see the pair serve up their respective dishes in \u014ctautahi, \u014ctepoti, T\u0101maki Makaurau, P\u014dneke, Te Papaioea, and Whanganui. Joined by local favourites, the tour will bring the sounds of provincial Aotearoa to the big smoke. To pair will also make a special stop in at the legendary T\u016brangi dairy \u2018Sanjay\u2019s Selection\u2019, to spin some tunes through the most bass boosted speakers in the Waikato.\n\nVia hardware synths and drum machines, Synthetic Children (Te Papaioea\u2019s Celina Goacher) is bringing bubbly synths, auto-tuned vulnerabilities, and sub-rattling beats. Her latest Smooch EP, and appearance on the Big Fresh Collective\u2019s Footmahi compilation, show an emerging fun side to her dancefloor arsenal, following the murky weight of 2023\u2019s Everything\u2019s Perpetual. Donnys worldwide have heralded the new release as a \u201cfreshly cooked 3 course meal, served up by Palmy\u2019s premier snack pack herself\u201d. Think wonky hyperpop with plenty of low end.\n\nDiesel Jenny\u2019s (P\u014dneke\u2019s Josh Finegan) live set will blend brain-breaking breaks with sugar-rush synths and 3D club energy years. This tour will celebrate the inaugural release of Diesel Jenny\u2019s white label series with a rock-solid RUC-exempt two-tracker. With multiple releases on underground mainstays Big Fresh Collective and Bankrupt Records as ABG, this isn\u2019t the first time Diesel Jenny\u2019s revved the engine.\n\nDiesel Jenny and Synthetic Children \u2018Backroom Smooches\u2019 Tour:\n4 July \u2013 \u014ctautahi \u2013 Flux* (with BWD)\n5 July \u2013 \u014ctepoti \u2013 Yours (supports TBA)\n11 July - T\u016brangi \u2013 Sanjay\u2019s Selection (DJ sets b2b Skymning)\n12 July \u2013 T\u0101maki Makaurau \u2013 Audio Foundation (with Baby Zionov)\n17 July \u2013 P\u014dneke \u2013 Valhalla (with Ekho Lahlia)\n18 July \u2013 Te Papaioea \u2013 Snails (with Club Tremaine, Cradle)\n19 July \u2013 Whanganui \u2013 Porridge Watson (with Alphabethead, Club Tremaine)\nTickets available from undertheradar.co.nz *Tickets from flicket.co.nz"

From his soulful early ballads and hard bop classics to the boundary-pushing spiritual intensity of his later free jazz works, this performance traces the full arc of Coltrane\u2019s musical journey.\n\n\n\nLed by drummer Oscar Garvie, the group is anchored by the expressive and deeply studied playing of saxophonist Isaac Randel, whose sound channels the fire and depth of Coltrane\u2019s voice. Randel brings a commanding front-line presence and a profound connection to the material, making him the perfect interpreter of Coltrane\u2019s vast and evolving musical language.\n\n\n\nThe band also features Jack Harris on bass and Tane Kelly on piano \u2014 a dynamic rhythm section that navigates the full emotional and sonic range of Coltrane\u2019s music.\n\n\n\nTogether, this quartet dives into every era of Coltrane\u2019s work \u2014 from the lyrical beauty of Naima and the modal mastery of Impressions, to the raw, transcendent fire of Ascension and Interstellar Space. This tribute isn\u2019t just a look back \u2014 it\u2019s a living, breathing expression of what Coltrane\u2019s music still means\n\nMusic from 9pm, FREE ENTRY"

    "description": "Recreating three entire classic rock albums live is no easy feat. The crew from Come Together are up for the task \u2014 they have been doing it for five years. The group of famous New Zealand musicians has organised a stellar lineup for 2025. First up they aim to capture the raw emotion of Neil Young\u2019s album \u2018Live Rust\u2019. Later in the year, they\u2019ll tackle the atmospheric complexity of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u2018Dark Side of the Moon\u2019, followed by the thunderous power of Led Zeppelin\u2019s album \u2018Led Zeppelin II\u2019. \nEach of these legendary albums will be performed in its entirety \u2014 track by track, back-to-back. There will also be an additional bonus set of deep cuts and classic hits. Some of the most talented musicians in the country pour everything they have into recreating this music with precision and passion. Look out for Reb Fountain, Jon Toogood, Julia Deans, Luke Buda, Jol Mulholland, and many more. Expect extended solos and spontaneous moments of magic. The electrifying energy between performers makes each show unforgettable."

    "description": "Inside Circa Theatre\u2019s waterfront venue, you\u2019ll find two performance spaces. Both offer a smorgasbord of professional theatre throughout the year. Playwrights from international heavy hitters to brilliant Kiwi voices are represented. It also includes programming from comedies and cabarets to contemporary dance and pantomime. \nBefore or after your show, visit the on-site caf\u00e9 brasserie and restaurant, Chouchou. It opens out onto a deck, where you can take it views across the harbour. Look up to admire the art installation above. Called \u2018Velarium\u2019, it undulates in the wind mirroring the water in the harbour. \nCirca Theatre began its life in 1976. A breakaway group of actors and theatre practitioners decided that Aotearoa needed a new and innovative approach to theatre. Five decades later it is still pushing boundaries, making people laugh and cry, and creating theatrical memories. \nIf you don\u2019t have your own Circa memory yet, there\u2019s an opportunity to create one nearly every night of the week."

It will offer twinkling lights, themed shopfronts, delicious street food, and live entertainment. The mid-winter Christmas magic will be enhanced by the promise of a special snow delivery, too. Get ready to have a cracker of a celebration."

    "description": "The next concert in our series presents a new project by Dave Wilson titled Free, Free: Meditations on Liberation. This project brings together a collective of musicians from across the music communities of P\u014dneke in an invitation to explore the expansive possibilities for what liberation might sound like.\n\nFree, Free draws from legacies of musical collectivity, and celebrates a commitment to both collaboration and the distinct expression of each individual.\n\nRanging from contemplative minimalism to ecstatic ensemble energy and body-moving grooves, the music of Free, Free invites musicians and other listeners to tend to each moment, making their own offerings to shape the collective sound.\n\nDave Wilson is a saxophonist, clarinettist, composer, producer, and interdisciplinary scholar. His music bridges avant-garde and experimental music with various groove-oriented styles from the worlds of jazz, R&B, electronic music, and more. With his 2023 album Ephemeral, described as \u201cquite spiritually intense music\u201d by The Guardian, he was a finalist for Te Manu Taki Tautito o te Tau | Best Jazz Artist at the Aotearoa Music Awards, and for the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award. Before relocating to Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington in 2016, Dave grew up in the Chicago area, lived for a decade in Los Angeles, and spent several stints living in Skopje, North Macedonia.\n\nFree, Free: Meditations on Liberation\nDave Wilson, Tyaan Singh \u2013 alto saxophone\nLouisa Williamson \u2013 tenor saxophone\nMonique Lapins, Mana Waiariki \u2013 violin\nKen Ichinose \u2013 cello\nKaito Walley, Natania Ngawhau \u2013 trombone\nBen Hunt \u2013 trumpet\nDaniel Hayles, Andrew Faleatua \u2013 piano and keyboard\nPhoebe Johnson \u2013 bass\nCallum Allardice \u2013 guitar\nHikurangi Schaverien-Kaa \u2013 drums\n\nThe performance will begin with an opening set by Flute Journeys, an offbeat mass flute ensemble with the self-described playing abilities of 5\u201312-year-olds, embodying a form of liberation in music.\n\nThe Jazz Orchestra Composer Series showcases original music for large jazz ensemble by New Zealand composers.

But we wouldn't want to overload you with too much exposition, huh?\nAnd before you scoff at its oddities, don't worry, Urinetown's already laughing at itself with jokes like \"Wee-wee never fail.\"  But beyond its potty humour and absurd premise, Urinetown: The Musical, unveils itself with its political messages that also satirises the musical genre. From a gospel number to a climax that references Les Mis\u00e9rables, it dazzles at the same time as it depresses.\nSo-- come and watch. If not for the comedic choruses, then for the capitalistic commentary. The musical reminds us, as much as we can laugh at the central conceit of the show, we're not so far from the songs it's singing. \nOriginal music and lyrics by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis (2001); performed by Tawa College.\""

    "description": "It keeps getting more expensive to heat our homes and water, cook our meals and get around. But there is a way to avoid those rising costs and Electrify Levin will show you how.  \nMost Levin homes could be saving thousands on their energy bills each year, while also slashing emissions, simply by upgrading their gas and petrol machines to the electric equivalents available today - and ideally powering them with solar and batteries for more self-sufficiency in case of power cuts or natural disasters.\nLevin has crossed the \u201celectrification tipping point\u201d where homes, farms and businesses can now save money and reduce their emissions by going electric. It\u2019s a massive win-win and a lot of people don\u2019t know about the potential savings that are hiding in their cupboards, kitchens and driveways. \nRewiring Aotearoa is trying to change that and we\u2019re supporting grassroots action across the country. Community electrification groups are popping up all over the place and helping to raise awareness about the benefits for their local region and helping locals through the process. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the buzz to Levin.\nCome along to hear from Mike Casey, who is saving tens of thousands a year on his all-electric solar-powered cherry orchard, and find out how electrifying Levin is the smartest, cheapest, and healthiest way to power our lives."

Chris says, \u201cI\u2019ve cried in every speech I\u2019ve ever delivered publicly, and this year when I slept on my neck weirdly, I may have bought myself an unnecessary neck brace. Still, I\u2019m desperate to prove that I\u2019m really chill and down to earth.\u201d\nChris Parker is a graduate of Wellington drama school Toi Whakaari O Aotearoa. He first built a reputation by posting funny videos on social media. Now he tours live shows and is a regular face on New Zealand TV.

This concert features Louis Vierne\u2019s Messe Solennelle, Op.16 and Gabriel Faur\u00e9\u2019s Requiem, Op. 48, two deeply expressive works that embody the boldness and tenderness of these masters\u2019 compositional styles.\n\nThe Bach Choir of Wellington welcomes soprano Rowena Simpson and baritone Joe Haddow, with Douglas Mews (organ), to bring these luminous works to life in the resonant acoustic of St Mary of the Angels.\n\nVierne originally envisioned his Messe Solennelle to be accompanied by orchestra, but his teacher, Charles-Marie Widor, advised him to use two organs (for practical reasons). Written while Vierne was organist at Notre-Dame de Paris, the work showcases his mastery of harmony with moments of both solemnity and radiant joy.\n\nFaur\u00e9\u2019s Requiem is a beautiful contrast to Vierne\u2019s mass, offering a more intimate and consoling vision of the afterlife. Though, when asked why he composed it, he declared, \u201cmy Requiem wasn\u2019t written for anything \u2013 for pleasure, if I may call it that!\u201d Beloved for its gentle melodies and serenity, the Requiem reflects Faur\u00e9\u2019s belief in eternal rest and peace.\n\nWe invite you to experience this afternoon of majestic and introspective French choral music."

    "description": "Sourdough for Beginners - $120 (paid via internet banking)\nCome join us for a hands-on, in-person sourdough workshop at Willow Corner Collective headquarters (aka my home)! This workshop is currently the only hands-on sourdough workshop being offered in the Nelson region - I teach and demonstrate to you and then you get to mix and practice on your own dough as we go along.\nWhether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this event is perfect for anyone looking to master the art of making sourdough bread, learning from someone who has 10+ years of experience. Perhaps you've found all the Youtube tutorials and Instagram how-to's overwhelming and are keen to learn via an in-person class. Then this is for you! I've baked hundreds of loaves in the last year alone, sold at a market, and hosted a pop-up shop. However, my passion really lies with teaching others to bake their own sourdough in their own homes, for their own families (or small businesses - one day!).You will be taught, demonstrated to, and then you get to have a go yourself; whilst learning my tips and tricks along the way. Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only*I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 7pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. Unfortunately if for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though. In extenuating circumstances I may be able to hold your ticket for a future workshop; this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight!From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody"

When? No-one knows!\n**This event also features the multi-faceted talents of 'Bottom Bunk Club' and 'The Rugs'\n***Doors will open by 8pm, and the performances will commence soon after!"

This is an excellent opportunity to treat yourself to some creative fun!\n\nThis is an excellent opportunity for a best friends' Sunday morning or a self-care session for yourself!\n\nIn weeks one and two you'll learn how to work with jeweller's hard wax to create beautiful textures in metal that can be used to create amazing rings or objects. Your waxes will be sent away for casting in the metal of your choice.\n\nThen there\u2019s a week break before the third session, to allow time for everyone's waxes to be cast. The third session covers how to trim, clean and finish your casts, turning them into original jewellery ready to wear!\n\nMore advanced students can use these sessions to complete projects in a class setting.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are all your different types of waxes, sandpaper and courier costs.\n\nNot included are the casting and metal costs which vary from student to student depending on what sized ring they want to make and the type of metal you choose. Small castings can cost around $6.65 - $12 and might cost between $7 to $30 in metals depending on if you use red bronze, white bronze or silver.\n\nThis class is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver."

    "description": "Although some observers are predicting that classical music is losing popularity, the Mulled Wine Concerts organisation in Paekakariki is finding exactly the opposite. Its 2025 season has produced several sell-out events in Kapiti and the organiser, Mary Gow is in a upbeat mood about the next concert in the series. She notes \"The Elouan Quartet who will be appearing at Paekakariki's iconic St Peter's Hall on Sunday July 20th features an outstanding chamber music quartet of principal players from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra who will be accompanied by the very popular principal flautist, Bridget Douglas\".\n\n\n\nThe Elouan Quartet with Bridget Douglas will present a captivating programme of music for flute and string quartet. Highlights include works by Mozart, Beethoven, Ginastera, Amy Beach, and Selina Fisher.These works are paired together in such a way as to compliment and contrast each other. Many of the works have a strong connection to the natural world, especially water, this most essential and beautiful compound that is our very lifeblood. The quartet comprises Jessica Oddie (violin), Anna Van der Zee (violin), Alexander McFarlane (viola} and Ken Ichinose (cello), names that will be familiar to followers of the NZSO. Bridget Douglas (flute) is also a well-known principal member of the orchestra\n\n\n\nAlmost every organisation involved in the arts in New Zealand is finding it tough going in 2025. Commercial sponsorship is very difficult to come by, and the grant-funding bodies are all facing cutbacks. But the demand is still there and Mulled Wine Concerts has found that their policy of presenting top-quality music in local venues and keeping ticket costs down as far as possible, is the right way to go. \"We have had good audiences for our recent events\" says Gow. \"People who think twice about going into the capital and paying high prices for travel and tickets like the idea that they can have good music locally\". With its popular combination of a string quartet and flute, presented by world-class musicians, Kapiti audiences will certainly appreciate the latest event in the series and it is likely to sell out quickly.\n\n\n\n=======ENDS======\n\n\n\nMulled Wine Concerts present: The Elouan Quartet with Bridget Douglas\n\nSunday July 20, 2025 at 2:30PM at St Peter's Community Hall, Beach Road Paekakariki.\n\n\n\nTickets $35 (Student under 16, $15).

    "description": "Nick Tomlin\u2019s talk, Leading from Within: Servant Leadership Through the Lens of PTSD Recovery, shares a powerful account of how living with PTSD has deepened his understanding and practice of Servant Leadership. By weaving personal experience with leadership insight, he illustrates how vulnerability, empathy, and resilience are not signs of weakness, but powerful tools for healing and leading authentically.\nThe session encourages leaders to embrace authenticity, support mental well-being, and foster cultures rooted in trust and service. Key points include:\nUnderstanding Servant Leadership and how it differs from traditional authority-driven models\nHarnessing vulnerability to build trust and psychological safety within teams\nSustaining resilience while navigating personal and professional adversity\nCreating supportive cultures where mental health is valued and people can thrive as their full selves\nIt\u2019s a compelling reminder that leadership is not about having all the answers\u2014it\u2019s about leading with heart, especially through the hard chapters.\nAbout Nick Tomlin\nBorn in Kent, England in 1968, [Name] served 25 years across the British Army and Royal Air Force, rising from Combat Medical Technician to Special Forces Commander of the Light Surgical Group. His deployments took him from Northern Ireland to Afghanistan, and he also proudly represented his service in rugby, cricket, and Ironman events.\nFollowing retirement, he became Medical Manager for the London 2012 Olympics before emigrating with his family to New Zealand. Today, he channels his energy into resilience coaching and mental health advocacy, drawing on personal experience after a post-service diagnosis of PTSD.\nWith gratitude for the support of his wife Fay, their two sons, and the SPARTA Project, he now speaks openly about invisible wounds, the power of vulnerability, and his mission to help others find hope and healing\u2014proving that true strength lies not in silence, but in connection.\nAbout Results Coaching\nFounded in 2011, Results Coaching (formerly Setanta Consulting), is one of New Zealand\u2019s fastest growing coaching practices. Our promise is to expand the horizons of our clients measured by observable growth through coaching and training events. As one participant put it, \u201cThis is the type of talk I\u2019m looking for at my stage of my career, i.e. focuses on personal development rather than technical skills.\u201d\nPlease Note: We may photograph or record the event for promotion purposes and may reproduce the image of any person who attends for any purpose without payment."

    "description": "Watercolour is special because of the fluid properties that produce spontaneous and unique results. The inability to anticipate exactly what the paint will do makes watercolour an exciting medium to work with.\n\nIn this course we will learn to set the conditions for surprising and beautiful accidents to occur on the page. By incorporating these looser abstract elements into representational paintings we can convey heightened emotions in our work.\n\nThroughout the term we will cover the following:\n\n- The wet into wet technique to achieve one of a kind paint interactions.\n- Learn about transparent colour mixing to create luminosity in your paintings.\n- Use marbling to find organic shapes and patterns.\n- Study the relationship between line and colour and the different ways they can be combined to find a personal style.\n- Experiment with composition through collage.\n\nEach class we will look at examples of historic and contemporary painting, and discuss how to selectively incorporate references into your work. Over the term you will build up a visual style and body of work.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new to watercolour or looking to expand your range, this course offers an opportunity to explore the expressive potential of watercolour.\n\nBasic materials included.\n\nMornings:\nWednesdays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n23 July - 10 September.\n\nEvenings:\nMondays, 6-8 m\n21 July - 8 September."

    "description": "Do you worry about your sons attitude & behaviour?\nDoes he need help building courage, confidence & resilience?\nDoes he struggle to care about or see his potential?\nOr are you just tired of repeating yourself over and over again only to get the same result, or even worse\u2026no response at all?\n\nIf you answered yes & can relate to some or maybe even all of these then the Motov8ing Boys event is for you and it's time you met John McMahon.\n\nMotov8ing Boys' is an event for Boys aged 11-17 and their parents; the goal is to help them to understand the power of a positive attitude, how to develop competnece & confidence, how to change destructive behaviour, how to identify personal potential & understand the importance of self-respect & respecting others, especially their parents.\n\nOne of the biggest deficits seen in young people today is a lack of social & emotional intelligence. This can lead to a whole range of problems with their personal development at home, at school & with friends both on & off line.\nIt can put unnecessary strain on relationships with siblings & sometimes unsustainable pressure on parents. Leading to everything from arguements, fights, anxiety, stress & depression through to significant family breakdown.\nIf you can relate to some or maybe even all of these then a Savage Angel event is for you.\nWho is John McMahon from Motov8 aka The Rev?\nJohn or Rev as he\u2019s more commonly known is a youth specialist with over 30 years experience working with young people in schools, sporting clubs & families across Australia, NZ & the UK. Through Motov8ing Boys events, seminars & talks delivered in schools, Rev has helped inspire & influence thousands of young people to make smarter more informed decisions.\nBoys will be boys\" is often used to explain away & excuse why boys say & do silly things. As a coach/mentor and parent himself Rev would rather see this statement reflect a very different sentiment. Rev's aim is to inspire boys to choose to become history making, high achieving & uniquely productive young men. Men of substance, conviction & hopes to do something significant with their lives.\nWhy This Event - Why Motov8ing Boys?\nAs parents it is our role to guide and advise our sons but it's for that exact reason they often don't want to listen. Sometimes the same message communicated in a different way and by a different person, is all that's needed to start to turn things around.\nThis event gives parents the opportunity to expose their sons to real advice about life in terms of when the 'rubber hits the road'. Rev engages young males through the use of motorcycles & draws from his years of rider experience to help them to navigate the twists, turns & obstacles that inevitably come across on the ride of life. This event is about much more than motorcycles so even if that's not you or your sons thing there's still a lot of value to be taken away from it.\nRev's communication style is direct, confronting, hard hitting, relative & impactful on both the boys & their parents. He's as direct as they come but it's his raw vulnerability that earns him the right to say what needs to be said to both boys & parents.\nWhat parents are saying about this event.\n\nBrad & Morgan Thomas We went to the Gold Coast event feeling like we were on our own going through this parenting journey that is raising boys aged 12 and 15. We soon relaised that we were not alone in our pain and frustration. Rev had this way of cutting through games our boys play with us to manipulate things to serve themsleves. We walked away with some very confronting truths to face and embrace. Our boys walked away with some clear areas to improve on and some very strategic answers to excuses and objections they hide behind.\n\nHayley & Hunter Motov8 and Rev absolutely nailed it at the boys' event in Toowoomba! I went along with my 12-year-old son and his friend, and they were hooked from the get-go. Rev\u2019s hard-hitting, raw truth style - mixed with powerful metaphors about life and motorbikes - really landed with them. They were so engaged they didn\u2019t want to leave at the end and were both keen to chat with Rev afterwards. It\u2019s not often you see two young boys hang off every word like that! Highly recommend for anyone raising boys who need strong, real, and relatable role models.\n\nClaire Kelly A friend suggested it and I just had that immediate gut feeling, that we had to take our boys. So, with real effort we dragged 3 tired boys out, not really knowing what to expect. It was great! When we got in the car afterwards, one of them said: \"Now that was surprisingly good, I actually really enjoyed it\"; and the other 2 agreed. Win! Thank you Rev! We will def be interested in further workshops.\n\nSeona Maybery My boy really didn't want to go to the workshop. I dragged him there with the attitude that it was going to be boring and so on. He couldn't believe that we would have to sit there for 2hrs but at the end of it he couldn't believe how quickly the time went. The comment was also \"that wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be\". A win win situation for me and I really think he'll get something out of it. I know that I learnt some things myself. Thanks for teaching us some great strategies to help with the anger. So much to take away from this workshop.\n\nSarah Verheyen Thank you. Your words are empowering for our teenagers, as I saw in my own boys tonight. The reflection that I saw in them was astounding, and the little changes that started as soon as we walked in the door were proof of the way that you captured their attention. I myself found it very inspiring to hear the way that you have learned how to be a parent - truly inspiring for people like me who have to teach themselves as they weren't taught from an early age. You have given me some steps to further this journey. Your stories and anecdotes really engaged us all.Thanks Rev.\n\nAaron & Bree Clifford We've been questioning our parenting for some time, doubting ourselves and our values. We walked into this event and we knew very little about it but it was recomended to us by the wellbeing coordinator at our sons school. It was not like anything we had been to before and in a good way. Everything Rev said connected with us in a deep and real way. We walked out and it was like we were both on the same page again. We know what's best for our son and will parent through the pain to get him where he needs to go. Thanks Rev for having the balls to do what you do and say what you say.\n\nSonya Carter Thanks for your info tonight, I have to say you connected with my boys (both 12) really well in a short space of time (I didn't expect this!). I was impressed with your matter-of-fact approach to neuro-diversity (and so was my neurodiverse son, he's never heard ASD spoken about so bluntly and he liked it.) The three things you said parents want was spot on and our families best take away. Shining a light on our young men's mental health crisis is so important - thanks for your dedication. Take care\n\nAll reviews are posted up exactly as we reicive them, to read more CLICK HERE\n\nMum's please don\u2019t just send your boys with their dad or your partner, where possible come as a family even if you\u2019re separated. There are things that need to be said to your son & it\u2019s much more impacting on them if you\u2019re there next to them. There are just as import things that need to be said to you in front of them as well.\nIt's very comon for the same boys who whinge, bitch, protest & complain to their parents about having to come along to also be the first boys to come & show gratitude to Rev & their parents after the event is finished.\nSo, turn off their tech/screens/headsets & bring your boys out to a night of inspiration, motivation mixed with some TUFF love & good advice that could just change your & their lives forever.\nWhat about the girls & their parents?\nWe also have a girls event called Savage Angels happening at the same location the following evening at the same time.

In terms of casualties, the morning of 12 October 1917 was - and is - the worst and bleakest day in New Zealand\u2019s history of warfare. 846 of our young men were killed on that morning alone and, by the end of the day, 2740 were dead, wounded or missing.\nTo commemorate those who fought and died, our Society Board invites you to join us and other guests as we remember the 1917 battle at Passchendaele.\nThe function will be hosted at Parliament Buildings by Cameron Brewer MP, Member for Upper Harbour and also a member of the Society.\nOur guest speaker will be Dr Graham Howie, PhD, OStJ, a career paramedic and university lecturer in paramedicine. In his talk \"Mighty few of the bearers are left\" he will tell us about the work of stretcher-bearers at Passchendaele, those early paramedics who laboured under the most dreadful conditions to rescue the dead and wounded."

What if the key to manifestation isn\u2019t about effort, but alignment?\n\nThis workshop explores how the wisdom of yoga philosophy can help us shift from the noise of a reactive, conditioned mind into a space of deeper inner alignment. Beyond just rewiring thoughts, yoga offers a map back to the part of us that is steady, clear, and deeply connected \u2014 an inner magnet that draws what is truly nourishing for our growth and transformation.\n\nThrough reflection, and an informed practice, you\u2019ll be invited to consider how tuning inwards can begin to shape your outer reality in more meaningful ways. Whether you're new to yoga philosophy or have walked this path for a while, this session offers a grounded and enriching perspective on the subtle art of manifestation.\n\nMeet your host, Rasesvari\nRasesvari is an events co-ordinator who loves to bring people together and create a warm and memorable experience. She thrives on connection with others and has a deep desire for a lifestyle of yoga, meditation and holistic healing."

    "description": "Do you worry about your daughters attitude & behaviour?\nDoes she strugle with a poor sense of self worth or fail to see her potential?\nDoes she lack courage, confidence & that spark she used to have?\nIs she obsessed with her phone, social media or other tech?\nDoes she struggle to suuround herself with friends who are good for her?\nOr are you just tired of repeating yourself over and over again only to get the same result, or even worse\u2026no response at all?\n\nIf you answered yes & can relate to some or maybe even all of these then a Savage Angels event is for you.\nSavage Angels is an event for girls aged 11-17 & their parents that's focused on Inspiring, Informing & Instructing them how to make smarter more informed decisions in life. We want to empower girls to hold core values that will allow them to stand strong in the face of social media & peer group influences. We know this event has the potential to make a huge difference in girls lives & their futures.\nOne of the biggest deficits seen in young people today is a lack of social & emotional intelligence. This can lead to a whole range of problems with their personal development at home, at school & with friends both on & off line.\nIt can put unnecessary strain on relationships with siblings & sometimes unsustainable pressure on parents. Leading to everything from arguements, fights, anxiety, stress & depression through to significant family breakdown.\nThe topics addressed at these events are all focused on personal development.\nThings like self-esteem, confidence, friendships & relationships, social media & mainstream media influence, anxiety, stress, depression, suicide, mindset, apathy, hope, dreams & the hard work required to kick arse in life.\nWhat parents are saying\n\nRyan & Torrey Hansel - Rev hit the nail right on the head with everything that was said at the Ipswich event we went to. We came for our girls but both of us parents walked away with just as much if not more than them. What was said about the value girls place on people they don't like or care about & what they say will stay with our younger daughter for life, she was so impressed with that simple concept that was taught. Thank you R, T, M15 & H12\n\nEle Hosie - Savage angel was such an awesome experience the story\u2019s where so real and it was incredibly inspirational and interesting to hear so many peoples stories I feel savage angel really shows you what people are going through and gives you a different perspective on things\n\nKirsten Webster - Thanks for a very powerful evening Rev. My 12year old daughter took a lot from the night and I have definitely noticed more peace, respect and contribution from her since! I also took a lot from it, I am absolutely stepping up my consistency with consequences. I highly recommend this to parents of girls who just need a little support with communication.\n\nLisa Short - Great evening, presentation was down to earth, related well to young audience. I recommend, certainly got nothing to lose so why not go along! it starts conversations.....\n\nSharon Baptist - The session was very open and honest and encouraging. A lot of the core values we had already discussed at home but hearing from Lana and Jo really impressed our girl!! An amazing night and I highly suggest going\n\nMelanie Nicholls - Well worth taking my daughter to this last night. Some very sad stories helped her to put her own life into perspective and she walked away being able to analise the values of true friendship. I\u2019m grateful that she could hear this talk at a young age. Thankyou.\n\nBelinda Marshall - Thank you so much to everyone involved in Savage Angel; tonight was fantastic! The speakers were so inspiring, all with different stories to tell. My 13yo daughter loved it and we will certainly be attending another event in the future.\n\nTaesha - Hi I\u2019m Taesha and I\u2019m using my mums phone I came to the first event tonight and it definitely has made me feel much braver and inspired me to push myself to be the best I can be. I\u2019m 10 years old and got a lot out of the event. Thanks for the savage angel cap and I will wear it proudly.\n\nDeborah Jean Scott - Wow what an awesome experience for both my girls 12 & 16. We all had tears in our eyes at different parts, even Dad. I can't recommend it more highly and would love to become involved with it, in some way. It will only keep going from strength to strength. Thank you all so much for sharing with us xxxx\n\nAll reviews are posted up exactly as we reicive them, to read more CLICK HERE\nOur ultimate goal is to influence millions of girls across the planet to blaze their own trail & to do it with a great sense of purpose. To do it like the Savage Angels we know they can become.\nWarning: These events are not for the politically correct because young people & parents don't think politically correctly when going through a tough time. We fully intend to say things that we know will challenge & upset both young people & parents so don't come along expecting it to be all marshmallows, unicorns & fairy dust because it will be anything but that. The message will be strong to both girls & their parents because that's how we get the results we do.\n\nPlease don't book in with a large group of friends, this is not another girls night out it's much more important than that. This is also not just a mother & daughter event, where possible try to come as a family even if you're separated & it's appropriate to do so.\nSo turn of the tech, screens & headsets they can do without TikTok, Insta & YouTube for 2hrs. Ignore the potential complaints & objections they wont resent you for bringing them, well not for very long.lol\nWe hope you can make it along to this very significant event.\nThe Savage Angel Team\n\nWhat about the boys & their parents?\nWe also have a boys event called Motov8ing Boys happening at the same location the night before at the same time.

The visit is strictly limited to 15 places, so get in quick!\nConstructed on behalf of Greater Wellington and Wellington Water, the new pipe bridge replaces a seismically vulnerable section of bulk water pipeline that supplies all of Porirua City and North Wellington. The project involves 1000 metres of 1-metre diameter steel pipe across the Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River and Manor Park golf course \u2013 including a striking new three-span pipe bridge with a 100m network arch at the central span.\nNamed Whakawhirinaki by local iwi during a dawn ceremony, the name reflects the trust and responsibility the bridge carries as it delivers essential water to thousands of people.\nThrough early contractor involvement and outside-the-box thinking, Brian Perry Civil and other project stakeholders have achieved significant cost savings and carbon reductions, showcasing innovation in both design and delivery.\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f This event is free and open to NAWIC members only\n\ud83e\uddba Spaces are limited. RSVP now to secure your spot!\nWe look forward to seeing you onsite!\nPlease note: NAWIC is a voluntary organisation, committed to its obligations as a PCBU under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.   Amongst other things, this requires NAWIC to take all practicable steps to eliminate, isolate or minimize hazards that our event attendees are exposed to.

Both these structural approaches contribute greatly to the success of your drawing.\n\nGeometric shapes can simplifying a subject, unify a drawing and make compositions dynamic. Geometric solids will help render any subject in three dimensions and transition to perspective.\n\nA good working knowledge of the concepts of perspective will help you draw any subject with correct dimensionality. It can also help in your realist drawing, painting and invented subjects and environments. These concepts are also used in most two dimensional art because it enables us to realise great spatial effects, making it an invaluable tool to add to your skill set.\n\nIn this course you will learn the following:\n\n- Focus on geometric shapes and solids and how they contribute to both realist and abstract drawing\n- Form an appreciation of geometry and shapes that can help with constructing a drawing\n- The important tools, methods and concepts of one-point, two-point and three-point perspective\n- Universal boxing, drawing ellipses\n- Hints in locating helpful lines and axis to draw real subjects\n- Introductory methods of working that blend perspective knowledge with real drawing situations\n\nAll basic materials supplied.\n\nWednesday evenings, 6:30 - 8:30 pm, 23 July - 10 September.\nOR\nFriday mornings, 10 am - 1 pm, 25 July - 12 September."

How many of them are there?\n\nHear from Professor Stephen Marsland about a fascinating application of mathematics to understand bird song and his software designed to answer those questions. Twelve or so years ago Stephen decided that sounds -- specifically bird sounds -- could be described as mathematical objects, and therefore could be used for conservation.\n\nStephen Marsland is a Professor of Mathematics and Data Science at Victoria University of Wellington. This has given him more opportunities than are reasonable, for a mathematician to work with taonga species of Aotearoa New Zealand. It has also led to the AviaNZ software and research programme, which tries to recognise the calls of New Zealand birds, and turn them into estimates of their abundance in an area. The software is freely available for anybody to use.\nWhen not wrangling kiwi and other birds he works on mathematical questions in evolutionary game theory (including why humans cooperate, and why sexual reproduction arose) and infinite dimensional geometry).\nRegister for catering purposes here at EventFinda.\nAgenda\n6:30 p.m. Doors Open and Light refreshments served\n7:00 p.m. Talk start\n8:30 p.m. Wrap-up."

    "description": "Anthony Donaldson is one of this country's great drummers a pioneer of improvised music in Aotearoa. A visual artist before becoming a musician, Anthony's starting point on the drums was in finding tonal colours, rhythms that come from nature, and constructing a drum kit that grew like a living sculpture, Beginning in the late 70s and early 80s with Primitive Art Group, his music making has always centred on free improvisation and collective composition. His musical journey has seen him perform with countless ensembles, often of his own creation, including the Black Sheep, Six Volts, Razorblades, Mean Bones, Flower Orphans, Teeth, Devils Gate Outfit, Rubbernecks, Farewell Spit, Melancholy Babes and the Stinging Nettles. He has been a creative force in Wellington music for over four decades and continues to push the boundaries of accepted musical norms, while encouraging and mentoring younger players.\n\nPyramid Club is very happy to host Anthony for two nights, performing solo and in collaboration with a large number of outstanding musicians. Gifted with a sparkling musical imagination, alongside his drum kit Anthony will be performing with electronics, 78rpm phonograph player, assorted percussion and spoken word.\n\nFor the first of his two night performance residency Anthony will be performing solo and in collaboration with:\ntrio with Nell Thomas (electronics) / David Long (guitar)\ntrio with David Donaldson (bass banjo) / Steve Roche (brass)\ntrio with Jonny Marks (Synthi AKS) / Daniel Beban (reel-to-reel)\n\nListen here to a recent Dancing in Your Head podcast featuring Anthony playing some of his own music and tracks which he's been listening to.\n\nAnd to his feature on RNZ's Mixtape a few years back\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\nPresale tickets for Night 1 $20\nPresale tickets for Night 2 $20\nPresales for a two-night pass $30\n\nR\u0101mere 25th July\nsolo\ntrio with Nell Thomas (electronics) / David Long (guitar)\ntrio with David Donaldson (bass banjo) / Steve Roche (brass)\ntrio with Jonny Marks (Synthi AKS) / Daniel Beban (reel-to-reel)\n\nR\u0101horoi 26th July\nduo with Riki Gooch (taonga p\u016boro/electronics)\nduo with Alphabethead (turntables)\nquartet with Bridget Kelly (reeds) / Toby Laing (trumpet/keys) / Tom Callwood (bass)\n\nSpecial thanks to Creative NZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme."

But there are plenty of other options on the menu available for those who do not want to indulge in Turkey and ham off the bone, plum pudding and other favourites.\n\nLunch is three courses (starter, main, dessert) for $65 pp and Dinner is $75 pp for five courses (amuse bouche, starter, main, dessert, petit fours)\n\nA wonderful lunch or dinner for a couple or a group, this Tirohana institution is something you won't want to miss. If you're feeling particularly festive, why not dress to suit the occasion - we'll be running a competition on our Facebook page for the best Midwinter photo.\n\nReservations are essential to secure a table for lunch or dinner.\n\nTo book a table please call 06 306 9933 or email makeabooking@tirohanaestate.com or book online https://www.tirohanaestate.com/restaurant/book-a-table/."

    "description": "Anthony Donaldson is one of this country's great drummers a pioneer of improvised music in Aotearoa. A visual artist before becoming a musician, Anthony's starting point on the drums was in finding tonal colours, rhythms that come from nature, and constructing a drum kit that grew like a living sculpture, Beginning in the late 70s and early 80s with Primitive Art Group, his music making has always centred on free improvisation and collective composition. His musical journey has seen him perform with countless ensembles, often of his own creation, including the Black Sheep, Six Volts, Razorblades, Mean Bones, Flower Orphans, Teeth, Devils Gate Outfit, Rubbernecks, Farewell Spit, Melancholy Babes and the Stinging Nettles. He has been a creative force in Wellington music for over four decades and continues to push the boundaries of accepted musical norms, while encouraging and mentoring younger players.\n\nPyramid Club is very happy to host Anthony for two nights, performing solo and in collaboration with a large number of outstanding musicians. Gifted with a sparkling musical imagination, alongside his drum kit Anthony will be performing with electronics, 78rpm phonograph player, assorted percussion and spoken word.\n\nThe the second of his two night performance residency, Anthony will be performing in collaboration with:\nduo with Riki Gooch (percussion/taonga p\u016boro/electronics)\nduo with Alphabethead (turntables)\nquartet with Bridget Kelly (reeds) / Toby Laing (trumpet/keys) / Tom Callwood (bass)\n\nListen here to a recent Dancing in Your Head podcast featuring Anthony playing some of his own music and tracks which he's been listening to.\n\nAnd to his feature on RNZ's Mixtape a few years back\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\nPresale tickets for Night 1 $20\nPresale tickets for Night 2 $20\nPresales for a two-night pass $30\n\nR\u0101mere 25th July\nsolo\ntrio with Nell Thomas (electronics) / David Long (guitar)\ntrio with David Donaldson (bass banjo) / Steve Roche (brass)\ntrio with Jonny Marks (Synthi AKS) / Daniel Beban (reel-to-reel)\n\nR\u0101horoi 26th July\nduo with Riki Gooch (taonga p\u016boro/electronics)\nduo with Alphabethead (turntables)\nquartet with Bridget Kelly (reeds) / Toby Laing (trumpet/keys) / Tom Callwood (bass)\n\nSpecial thanks to Creative NZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme."

Princess Chelsea\u2019s Midwinter Ball returns, this year with a new theme: SWORDS AND SORCERY - Fantasy on The Big Screen. With your esteemed host comedian Tom Sainsbury, and live performances from Princess Chelsea & The Dream Warriors in both centres, with Auckland guests The Circling Sun & Golden Axe, while Wellington will be treated to sets from Grecco Romank & Luke Buda.\n\nIn the shimmering and VHS-heavy age of the early 1980s, a treasure trove of cinematic fantasy was thrust upon us. Gleaming swords and potent spells in Excalibur, the ethereal beauty and terror of Legend, valiant quests of The Sword and The Sorcerer, Ladyhawke, The Beastmaster, Willow, Dragonslayer, and the mighty & muscular quests of Conan The Barbarian. And let us not forget the timeless enchantments of pure fantasy with The Neverending Story, the delightful Princess Bride, the poignant Last Unicorn, and the unforgettable shape of Labyrinth.\n\nSo, brave adventurers, will you join us to celebrate this golden age? How will you dress to impress as visions of enchanted lands and heroic feats conjure a costume fit for fantasy?\n\nCalled by many as \u2018the show of 2024\u2019, last year\u2019s Twin Peaks themed Midwinter Ball was a revelation, and a dress up party for the ages. A sold out Wintergarden heaved with 650 guests dressed as Log Ladies, Agent Dale Coopers, and even a giant slice of cherry pie\u2026 and oh, so much more.\n\nPrincess Chelsea and her band The Dream Warriors delighted the audience with a blazing set of originals alongside covers of Julee Cruise, Angelo Badalamenti and In Heaven from Lynch\u2019s Eraserhead. This wild and unforgettable night has been lovingly captured and presented as a four song tribute to David Lynch, due for imminent release.\nFor 2024\u2019s Twin Peaks-themed ball, no expenses were spared on transforming the venue into the quaint town of Twin Peaks. Decoration which featured lasers, an indoor pine forest, a shrine to Laura Palmer and a replica of the infamous Red Room, we can only expect magic and mystery from 2025\u2019s fantasy- themed ball.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving too much away but obviously we will need a medieval sword fight\u201d - Princess Chelsea\n\nIf last year\u2019s ball was anything to go by, I don't think she is joking - and further shenanigans will undoubtedly ensue. Expect the Civic and Meow Nui to be transformed into a world of fantasy.\n\nEarlybird tickets are on sale Friday at 10am. Book your evening, and swan down the red carpet dressed in your favourite fantasy-inspired outfits. Portraits will be taken on the night, and prizes for best dressed."

What of our current network and communications infrastructure, and all our most used sites and services, would function when we\u2019re \u2018cut off\u2019 from the rest of civilisation?\n  Join us in a playful lab environment helping build the first \u2018map\u2019 of what our digital experience would look like if it was just us - from healthcare, to education, banking and the big socials. In doing so, we\u2019ll get a sense of just how infrastructurally independent \u2013 and resilient \u2014 we are as a nation.\n  Participants will learn how to use simple network probing and website analysis to pull websites and networks apart, looking under the hood at just how much is hosted overseas.\n  This is a team effort, with no prior knowledge required.

The session has been crafted musically, leaning on deep drones from Paiste gongs and other instruments that harmonize together in layers, rather than loud, crashing strikes of the gong. Nick considers the nervous system throughout, giving you an experience of 'dropping' into deeper brainwave states through the form and gentle introduction.\nThe sound of the session is more like contemporary ambient music using acoustic instruments than traditional Eastern music, and positive feedback has included: feeling extremely relaxed, to having psychedelic imagery, to processing old memories. You never know what might happen, so its about just being open to the experience.\n$35 per person with limited tickets/spaces!"

And tickets are priced like a bottle of bachelor wine!\n\nInterlopers are based around the long-gestating songbook of Andrew Armitage and mellifluous cello and vocals of Sarah Laing, backed by the solid sync of Phil Peleton on bass and David Morgan on percussion.\n\nMr. Morgan described their drummer-less incarnation as 'The Front Lawn' meets 'Violent Femmes' so they had no choice but to let him join. A few post-punk covers are thrown in for good measure, but their focus is on time-honoured song craft with a good measure of wit and wisdom.\n\nInterlopers are as yet unrecorded, but you can check out their little live music video of 'Bachelor Wine' for a wee taster..."

Monaghan responds in real time, creating a feedback loop between human, organism, and machine.\n\nTheir debut album, GUEST, was recorded during the 2024 Sonic Artist Residency (Creative New Zealand / NZSM / Toi P\u014dneke) and emerged through open-ended, intuitive sessions. A diverse group of collaborators was invited to join the process, including Kedron Parker, Nico Buhne, Bill Wood, Ruby Solly, Indigique Brown, David Long, Andrew Faleatua, Andy Wright, Gemma Thompson, Timothy Morel, Mo H. Zareei, Tae Kyung Seo, Issac Smith, and Chrissie Butler.\nRather than guiding the music, contributors were invited to follow it\u2014adding their voices to a living, shifting ecology of sound. The result is an album that is rhythmic, irregular, immersive, and alive.\n\nGUEST is co-released by Audio Foundation Records (T\u0101maki Makaurau) and skirted Records (Te Whanganui-a-Tara).\n\nKIERAN MONAGHAN\nKieran Monaghan is a self-taught multi-instrumentalist, writer, recording artist and sound bogan based in Te Whanganui-A-Tara. He is a prolific creative and organiser, with an irrepressible DIY ethic, known for his experimental and innovative approach to performance and sound making.

    "description": "Join us for an immersive workshop  that bridges ancient indigenous traditions with cutting-edge neuroscience to explore the powerful intersection of cacao, psychedelics, and spiritual transformation.\nIn this workshop, you will discover the rich history and sacred significance of cacao in indigenous cultures, focusing on its use in ancient Peru. Learn about the temples, tribes, tools, and symbols associated with cacao, as well as its role in shamanic rituals. We will delve into the cosmovision that links cacao with psychedelic plant medicines and how these ancient practices are integrated with modern scientific understanding.\nKey Highlights:\n-The Sacred Role of Cacao: Explore the origins of cacao in the ancient temple of Montegrande and Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar, Peru, key sites of shamanic initiation dating back over 7000 years. Shamans used ceremonial cacao to connect with the divine and combined it with San Pedro cactus to induce visionary experiences.\n-Cacao & Neuroscience: Understand how ceremonial cacao influences brain chemistry and supports spiritual awakening and neuroplasticity. We'll discuss the latest neuroscience research on cacao\u2019s ability to facilitate transformational change and rewiring of the brain.\n-Cacao Personality Mapping: Through biochemical mapping, we have developed a \"Cacao Personality Map\" to help you tailor your cacao experience to your personal needs, whether for healing, insight, or emotional clarity.\n-Integrating Tradition & Modern Science: Learn how ancient practices are validated and enhanced through contemporary neuroscience, and discover how cacao can be a tool for deep inner work and to enhance both mental and physical health.\n\nIf you\u2019re passionate about cacao and curious about its transformative potential, this workshop  will expand your understanding and deepen your connection with this sacred plant. Whether you\u2019re a cacao lover or a seeker on a spiritual path, this experience will open your mind to the possibilities cacao holds for healing, awakening, and change.\nDate: Tuesday 29th Jul 2025, 6.30 - 8.30 pm NZST\nLocation: Commonsense Kapiti - Coastlands\nTickets: Book online from $5-15 (ultra early bird - late pre-sales)\nExtras: Get 10% off all Seleno Health products after the event and a free sample cup of a creamy ceremonial cacao elixir during the workshop.\nPresenter:\nDr Corin Storkey (PhD \u2013 Med Chem) has over 20 years of academic and research experience, specialising in understanding how plant medicines interact with the brain and body.

    "description": "\u201cSEARCHING FOR IDENTITY\u201d\nBy Claire Bruell\nDesign & Production by Mike Reganon\n\"This is your history, these are your stories, my gift to you.\" These are the last words in Claire Bruell's four-book series to future generations - her \"five beautiful grandchildren\", Simon, Sofia, Lily, Nate, and Isaac.\nBut more than a gift to her grandchildren, these books spell out the trauma Jews have faced over millennia and, through her resolute and gently probing of the Bruell and Briess family trees over four generations, she exemplifies the lives of so many. Jews around the world will identify with the tragedies and joys, the uplifting and the horror, the sheer delight and abject gloom.\nCarefully moulded over four books, Claire describes these stages and reveals the lives of her ancestors as they grow and achieve success, have wonderful families, meet catastrophe, are split asunder, murdered by Nazis, and finally regather the remnants to rebuild - a story so familiar to Jews who have only sought peaceful coexistence for centuries.\nClaire will describe aspects of the process of creating that content from age 32 through to today, and with Mike, will speak about some of the features of working together and the exquisite joy of laying it all out on paper.\nClaire Bruell\nClaire is a historian particularly interested in 19th-century Europe and the Holocaust. Her interests span history, genealogy, reading, collecting curios and ex libris, and from time to time she speaks and writes on many of these subjects. She has been a Justice of the Peace for 30 years and the coordinator of an oral history project in Auckland for almost as long. Her days are focused on family and community.\nMike Reganon\nMike is a retired teacher, journalist, editor, designer, and publisher. He has dabbled in pottery, sculpture, printing, oil painting, and renovating the family home, a lifetime occupation. Today, he continues his clay creations by joining a local pottery group and has begun learning Yiddish using Duolingo. As those skills improve, he hopes to find others keen to practice the mamaloshen, but right now he\u2019s farshmakht.\nImportant Update\nTo ensure the continued delivery of our high-quality speaker series, we've transitioned to a paid model.

Known for jaunty songs and often tongue-in-cheek vocal style, Herman\u2019s Hermits had many transatlantic hits. With catchy tunes like Mrs Brown, You Got a Lovely Daughter, Henry the VIII, No Milk Today, and There\u2019s a Kind of Hush, you\u2019ll have plenty to tap along to. \nHerman\u2019s Hermits was one of the \u2018British Invasion\u2019 bands that followed the success of The Beatles in the 1960s and 70s. They hit the American pop charts 22 times with songs that became rock\u2019n\u2019roll anthems all over the world. The Wellington Show promises to be as energetic and lively as they were six decades ago."

Despite this being an increase from previous years, significant structural and cultural barriers persist for women seeking to enter and remain in politics.\nFrom issues around childcare to gender-based violence to stereotypes in the media, women experience hostility at all levels of the political sphere. Several women in local government across the country spoke with Breakfast in April, sharing the hateful comments they\u2019ve received online, with abuse and violent threats often spilling into the real world.\nSo how do we encourage more women into political leadership, and what needs to be done to keep them there?\nThe Wellington Branch of National Council of Women New Zealand, in collaboration with Graduate Women Wellington and Zonta Club of Wellington, are hosting The Annual Women\u2019s Debate 2025 to discuss this question.\nThe event will be hosted by award-winning journalist and broadcaster for RNZ, Susie Ferguson. She'll be joined by a stellar line-up of women:\nSusan Freeman-Greene, Chief Executive of Local Government New Zealand\nTory Whanau, Mayor of Wellington City\nAfnan Al-Rubayee, senior public servant and community leader\nRebecca Matthews, Wellington City Councillor\nThis year\u2019s Annual Women\u2019s Debate will focus on the experiences of women from across the political spectrum and the gendered obstacles they have faced in politics. Furthermore, the debate will explore what is being done to address barriers to women\u2019s political leadership, and how women representatives can empower a #GenderEqualNZ.\nLight refreshments will be available from 5:30pm before the debate starts at 6:00pm."

We'll discuss the latest neuroscience research on cacao\u2019s ability to facilitate transformational change and rewiring of the brain.\n-Cacao Personality Mapping: Through biochemical mapping, we have developed a \"Cacao Personality Map\" to help you tailor your cacao experience to your personal needs, whether for healing, insight, or emotional clarity.\n-Integrating Tradition & Modern Science: Learn how ancient practices are validated and enhanced through contemporary neuroscience, and discover how cacao can be a tool for deep inner work and to enhance both mental and physical health.\n\nIf you\u2019re passionate about cacao and curious about its transformative potential, this workshop  will expand your understanding and deepen your connection with this sacred plant.

You'll discover why your brain fixates on worry, how to interrupt rumination before it spirals, and master simple techniques that create instant mental clarity. Walk away with a proven system based on FasterEFT for transforming your overthinking patterns into inner peace, so you can finally quiet the noise and reclaim control of your mind.\n\nPlus, your ticket includes a nourishing plant-based dinner and dessert\u2014because taking care of your mind is best supported by feeding your body well.\n\nMeet Krishnaloka, your host\n\nIntroducing Krishnaloka, who is driven to help others overcome their issues within their mind and pyschology. As a mind technician trained in eutaptics (Faster EFT), she employs the fastest and most powerful method to create lasting change by addressing the root causes of issues rather than just the symptoms. Her warm and caring nature makes every interaction with her both comforting and transformative."

The series lineup includes:\n\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\n\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\n\nTickets are available now, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\n\nAbout the Artists\n\nLudus\n\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\n\nStephen Gallagher\n\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\n\nDavid Long\n\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\n\nJules Desmond\n\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\n\nOghum\n\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\n\nJess Chambers\n\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\n\nAbout the Venue\n\nBuilt in 1866, Old St Paul\u2019s is a prime example of timber Gothic Revival architecture and one of Aotearoa\u2019s most important historic places. Managed and operated by Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, it is a venue steeped in history and beauty.\n\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration."

    "description": "Overcoming Imposter Syndrome for Creatives\nThere is a widespread \u2018lack of confidence\u2019 epidemic among creatives, and if you have ever felt like your work is not good enough, hesitated to submit your art to competitions, or doubted your skills when applying for creative jobs, you are not alone! Creatives often feel imposter syndrome most acutely. Unlike other industries, those in the creative field produce something new every time, and sharing this with the world can be daunting, even for established artists.\n This pervasive self-doubt, known as imposter syndrome, affects countless artists and creators, often holding them back from realising their full potential. This concise workshop is designed to help you uncover the roots of this inner voice of insecurity and provide you with effective tools to overcome it.

    "description": "A fabulous and fun introduction to jewellery making over two mornings, this is our most popular short workshop! Give yourself a gift of a new hobby and walk out of the class with a unique beautiful piece of jewellery!\n\nThe students start with basic ring making in copper or brass. We begin with ring making as this process teaches students many fundamental techniques in one project, measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting, soldering and finishing are all included in this one ring.\n\nStudents will learn how to measure their fingers to get an accurately sized ring, later they will also learn how to take sizing from existing rings. They are shown how to use a jeweller\u2019s saw to cut their metal to the correct length, how to form it up and how to solder.\n\nThen they learn how to shape their rings and finish them up into a wearable piece of jewellery, all in the first class!\n\nIn the first morning they are also shown how to texture metals, cut and layer shapes, melt balls of silver and other techniques to create decorative elements.\n\nStudents can spend their afternoon and evening thinking about and planning their design in silver for the next day. We encourage them to carefully plan this project and think about how they might make their piece before they begin, including creating drawings and notes. (We always say drawings don\u2019t need to be \u201cgood\u201d, they just need to make sense to the student and their tutor!). This project can be another ring, or earrings or pendants. We have a great selection of example pieces in the workshop so they can see what\u2019s achievable in the 3 hour time frame. Sometimes students can make more than one silver piece if they have enough time.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are copper and brass for practising on, up to 8 grams of sterling silver and all consumables such as sandpaper, solder and chemicals. Extra metals and chains are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nKids 12 and up are welcome in this class, any person under 16 years old must be accompanied by an enrolled caregiver."

    "description": "Join us for an Ecstatic Dance and Sound Journey to raise vital funds for Mahmoud Al-Madhoun and his family, who are from Northern Gaza.\nMahmoud shares four children with his wife, Nour. They have a baby girl named Omnia (age 1), and three sons, Team (3), Ahmed (7) and Faiz (11). Omnia and her mother, Nour, were evacuated from Gaza via ambulance during the last ceasefire, before hostilities resumed. Unfortunately, Mahmoud and Omnia\u2019s three big brothers were denied evacuation. Thus, the boys remain in Gaza with Mahmoud, where things are painfully difficult. Like all Palestinians, they are struggling to survive and the hardships just keep intensifying.\nUpon arrival in Cairo, Omnia had to wait weeks for open heart surgery, a life saving treatment that she required at birth. With Gaza under constant bombardment, Omnia was unable to have surgery once her parents learned of her condition shortly after her birth.\nMahmoud and Nour have lost everything, their house, their livelihoods, and have been forced to evacuate multiple times, all while managing the complexities that come with supporting a child with difficult medical needs. Their suffering has been further exacerbated because of them being separated, meaning Mahmoud was unable to support his daughter and wife during surgery. No parent ever should be forced to endure such dire and heartbreaking circumstances.\nThis event is a call for community, compassion, and action \u2014 every dollar raised will go directly to help Mahmoud provide basic necessities and rebuild a sense of safety and hope for his family.\nLet\u2019s come together in movement and music to support this family in their time of urgent need. Your presence and contribution can truly make a difference.\nMeet the Team:\n\nKellie Smith\u2014 Sound Ceremonialist\nKellie is a sacred space holder and sound practitioner. She completed her Master\u2019s degree in Criminology in 2012, specialising in genocide and international humanitarian law. She draws upon her professional background and experience in trauma support work, blending themes of collective consciousness and justice into her sound offerings.\nShe brings deep love and wisdom into every tone and vibration she channels. Her sound frequencies and crystal-clear presence invite you into a realm of deep remembering, restoration, and renewal through the power of sound.\nLisa Schady \u2014 Voice of the Sacred\nLisa Schady is a captivating performing artist known for curating transformative spaces using her powerful voice and intuitive mic presence. With deep reverence, she guides participants through emotional landscapes with safety and intention. If you\u2019ve ever stepped into one of her temples, you\u2019ll know\u2014Lisa creates sacred containers where what\u2019s alive within can rise and be felt.\nAndrzej \u2014 Musical Mystic\nAndrzej is a musician extraordinaire whose ecstatic dance sets are a journey in themselves. With a rich tapestry of tribal beats, global rhythms, and soul-stirring melodies, he\u2019ll guide us up, in, through, and out\u2014awakening the body, stirring the spirit, and inviting pure, embodied expression. His music opens portals to presence, joy, and freedom. Offering an expansive celebration of dance and movement in the name of peace.\nSaxon Brazier holds a Diploma in Music and Event Management. Deeply moved and conflicted by the ongoing genocide in Gaza, she has spearheaded this kaupapa as a way to turn anguish into action\u2014organizing efforts to raise funds and awareness in support of a family\u2019s urgent journey to safety."

A wider range of plant species also allows for the forest to naturally regenerate and helps prevent weed species from establishing.\n\nTools are provided, bring sturdy shoes and a water bottle, Working bees are held every Sunday in June (except June 1st - Kings Birthday Weekend) and August 2025.\n\nMeeting at the Information Shelter in the Tapu te Ranga car park at the end of Danube Street in Island Bay. Children are welcome with parents or guardians."

Popular New Zealand musicians Monique Lapins (violin), Ken Ichinose (cello) and pianist Gabriela Glapska are all familiar faces on the Waikanae stage, having appeared with numerous other chamber ensembles. They have named their group after the work they are about to perform on this tour - Beethoven's Opus 70, No 2 trio which is known as \"The Ghost\" because of the eerie, ominous sounds in the gloomy second movement. The two outer movements are much brighter, the first bold and energetic, the third witty and playful.\n\nTwo brief and contrasting works complete the first half of this varied concert. Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu has been acclaimed as the most important composer in Japanese musical history. His piece \"Between Tides\" illustrates his great love of nature. New Zealand composer Glen Downie's new work (being premiered on this tour) was inspired by the simplicity of Vivaldi\u2019s cello sonatas and the baroque form known as sonata da chiesa.\n\nThe second half of the concert will be dominated by one of the greatest piano trios of the 20th Century - Shostakovich's Opus 67. Written in 1944 amid World War II, the trio responds to the conflicts of those times, but also to the composer's personal circumstances. It is an elegy for the tragic victims of war, but also expresses Shostakovich's grief at the sudden death of his closest friend and mentor Ivan Ivanovich Sollertinsky. The opening movement is bleak and despairing, followed by a lively, almost obsessive Scherzo. The third movement is a starkly beautiful funeral dirge while the last movement brings together themes from the previous movements, also introducing new Russian and Jewish themes.\n\nDoor sales will be available for this concert or tickets can be bought from Waikanae New World and Moby Dickens Books in Paraparaumu Beach. Ticket enquiries can be made at 022 345 5316 or from the society's website www.waikanaemusic.org.nz\n\nThe Ghost Trio concert is presented as part of Chamber Music New Zealand\u2019s \"In Partnership Series\"."

This set will feature stripped back arrangements of his songs accompanied with string arrangements performed by Karen Hu (cello), and Hijiri Yamamoto (violin).\n\nBen Chavasse is a 26-year-old singer-songwriter based in T\u0101maki Makaurau. His lyric-forward approach embraces the indie-folk genre while incorporating rock, punk, and jazz influences. He explores themes of adolescence, mental health, and reconciliation through an introspective, reflective and vulnerable lens. Ben continues to thrive in collaboration with local musicians he met during his studies at the University of Auckland Jazz School.\n\nBronwyn Wilde grew up across the road from Vogelmorn and can remember performing at the Hall as early as age six (she sang the national anthem at the Ridgway school talent quest - it was not a winning song choice). Today, she is a trustee of the Vogelmorn Community Group and occasionally works behind the bar, where she has been lucky to see so many talented local musicians perform.\nShe has many fond memories of singing with Ben together in their flat in Auckland during the 2021 lockdown. She is thrilled to be joining him on stage at Vogelmorn, her second home."

This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations.

I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us.

    "description": "Life can be hard.\nWe want to help you manage life when it\u2019s difficult. And we know that for many people ACT has a profound and positive effect on wellbeing.\nACT for Everybody is a 6 week course where you\u2019ll learn how to interact more helpfully with thoughts, feelings and behaviours that you struggle with. You\u2019ll develop your ability to move towards what matters to you even when you\u2019re feeling bad. And you\u2019ll do this with a small group of others.\nWe know that people wonder whether groups are for them! We find that discovering ACT in a group provides special opportunities to learn from each other and highlight how all our minds get stuck in struggle at times. The course includes chances to share but you can choose how much or little you contribute. Here is some feedback from a previous participant:\nThe course gave me scheduled time to stop and reflect in a non-threatening environment. It wasn\u2019t rushed, it wasn\u2019t pressured but there was a lot of skills, knowledge and tools that through the course became part of me. The course opened up struggles within me that I did not know were there and helped me deal with them. It gave me tools to deal with feelings that sent me in a spiral to dark places. It taught me that I can always do something. I went to the course believing that I was not brave enough to live my life and left with the courage to live it.\nWhat is ACT?\nWe think about Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as a way of helping people live their lives based on their values, and without painful thoughts and feelings getting in the way.\nEmotional pain is a normal and unavoidable part of human experience. Often it is the struggle to avoid painful thoughts and feelings that leads to suffering. ACT is literally about taking action: accepting what you can\u2019t change and committing to what you can.\nWhat can I expect?\nACT for Everybody is a supportive, interesting, safe, confidential and fun course. It\u2019s facilitated by experienced psychologists with between 8 and 14 participants. It runs for 2 hours on Tuesday afternoons, from 4:00pm to 6:00pm.\nYou need to join us for the first night of the course in order to take part in the rest of the course.\n\n\nGiselle Bahr is a clinical psychologist and co-founder of ACT Wellington. She has been using ACT in her practice for over 15 years, and has been trained and supervised by many of the world\u2019s leading ACT therapists and researchers. Giselle has worked at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, in Private Practice with adults and adolescents, and trained new clinical psychology students at Victoria University of Wellington. Giselle has developed and facilitates a group introducing ACT to Parents.\nTania Stanton works as a clinical psychologist at the Maternal Mental Health Service. She has previously worked in Infant, Child, Adolescent and Family Services where she co-developed and facilitated therapy groups for young people and their parents using ACT. She is enthusiastic about the help that ACT can offer to enhance people's lives."

    "description": "Parenting can be both a joy and very hard work.\nBut things get in the way of us being the parents we want to be - including our own thoughts and feelings. These can be about ourselves, about our children, about our parenting, or about what others think about our parenting.\nYour Parenting ACT is a 6 week course for parents of school aged children where you can develop a strong foundation for your parenting. It helps you understand your child, develop your self, nurture your relationship with your child and parent in line with your values. It uses principles from ACT \u2014 Acceptance and Commitment Training \u2014 to help you make room for all your thoughts and feelings, so you can respond more calmly and flexibly as a parent.\nACT uses acceptance, mindfulness and behavioural strategies to help people pursue what matters most to them, including being the parent they want to be.\nWe know that people wonder whether groups are for them! But we find that discovering ACT with and from people who are having similar experiences such as parenting, is very effective and fun. A recent attendee said:\n\"I can read all the books, but there's nothing like meeting and hearing from other parents.\"\n\n\nThe course is held over six consecutive Tuesday evenings from 7:00pm to 9:00pm.\nWe understand that sometimes things get in the way of plans, and occasionally people can't make a night of the course. But it is essential that you attend the first night of the course in order to take part in the remaining sessions. The course includes invitations to share and experiential exercises that work best when we are able to get to know one another and develop trust in the group.\n\nThis course needs a minimum number of parents to go ahead. So if you've decided to come, please sign up! It's very helpful to know that we have enough people to proceed.\n\n\nGiselle Bahr is a clinical psychologist working in Wellington who continues to parent two adult children. She works primarily with young people and their families in private practice. Before that she spent 15 years working in Wellington's public health system and teaching in a university clinical training programme.\nTania Stanton works as a clinical psychologist at the Maternal Mental Health Service. She has previously worked in Infant, Child, Adolescent and Family Services where she co-developed and facilitated therapy groups for young people and their parents using ACT. She is enthusiastic about the help that ACT can offer to enhance people\u2019s lives."

It contrasts the frivolity of a masquerade with high drama. For this production, Wellington Opera has gathered a cast made exclusively of New Zealand opera singers. Madeleine Pierard and Jared Holt return after headlining the 2024 production of \u2018Tosca\u2019. Joining them are Julien Van Mellaerts, Natasha Te Rupe Wilson, Kristin Darragh, and Morgan King. \nThe opera is based on the true story of the 1792 assassination of King Gustavo III of Sweden. He was shot while attending a masked ball \u2014 a result of a political conspiracy. The staging, by Jacqueline Coats, promises to bring the dramatic storyline to life. Brian Castles-Onion will conduct Orchestra Wellington."

    "description": "This event is also available online on Zoom.\nHow we understand faith and science has changed radically from the time of Galileo, as can be seen in how Pope Francis blended science and faith in his encyclical Laudato Si\u2019. Its key insight is that our science, and the technology it spawns, is deeply connected to the flawed but redeemable human persons who do the science, and who make and live with technology... and its consequences\nBr. Guy Consolmagno, SJ, is an American Jesuit brother and planetary scientist, currently serving as the Director of the Vatican Observatory and President of the Vatican Observatory Foundation. He is known for his research on meteorites, asteroids, and the evolution of small solar system bodies, as well as his popular writings on astronomy and faith. He holds degrees from MIT (SB, SM) and the University of Arizona (PhD in Planetary Science) and has worked in astronomy at Harvard and MIT before entering the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in 1989.\nBr. Guy has been at the Vatican Observatory since 1993, curating the meteorite collection and conducting research. He was appointed director in September 2015 by Pope Francis. His research focuses on the physical properties of meteorites and asteroids, including their spectra and how they relate to the evolution of the solar system. He is the author of several popular books, including \"Turn Left at Orion\" (with Dan Davis) and \"Would You Baptize an Extraterrestrial?\" (with Paul Mueller, SJ). He is also a popular speaker on the topic of faith and science, and serves on the governing boards of various international scientific organizations.\nThis event is co-hosted by Te Kupenga \u2013 the Catholic Leadership Institute, Te Herenga Waka - Victoria University of Wellington and the Wellington Astronomical Society"

Therefore, we announce with great pleasure that noted historian\u202fDame Claudia Orange DNZM OBE CRSNZ\u202fwill present our opening lecture in this series, which focuses on the history of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the Waitangi Tribunal.\n\nEncouraging discussion on the Treaty of Waitangi is a vital part of continuing efforts to fulfil the promise of the 1840 agreement. Dame Claudia argues that a broad public understanding of the changes that have occurred in the M\u0101ori\u2013Crown relationship is essential in order for those relationships to grow. She says that an understanding of history is vital, and informed vigilance is necessary.\n\nTickets are $35 per session, or $25 for students and SuperGold Card holders, and include one drink and light kai. Doors open 5:30pm.

    "description": "Musical improv can be absolute magic. Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years. She directed One Night Band which won 'Most Original Production' at the Wellington Theatre Awards 2023, and performs regularly as both a player and musician for POPROX.\nISAAC THOMAS has been an improviser and improv musician for a decade in P\u014dneke and Whakat\u016b/Nelson. He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2025. We'll giveaway any spots remaining a few days before the first workshop of the course, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email poproximprov@gmail.com and we'll pop you on the SBL. Everyone on the list will be notified whether there was a place available for them 3 days before the first workshop."

From duets, to quartets, to a full chamber orchestra, we're getting up close to the celebrated chamber music and lasting legacy of Dimitri Shostakovich, 50 years after his death.\nWe invite you to join us on the journey of \u201cShostakovich: UNPACKED\u201d, as together we explore and question what this powerful music meant in the time Shostakovich wrote it, but also how vitally important the composer\u2019s artistic voice still is today.\nConcert Two: Wednesday 6 August, 6:30pm, NZSQ x Antipodes Quartet\nArtists onstage: NZSQ / Antipodes Quartet\nShostakovich: 6th and 7th String Quartets, String Octet\nUnpacked: The music of Gao Ping\nSpotlight: Be part of Aotearoa\u2019s musical history, as the first chapter of the newly formed Antipodes Quartet unfolds in their Wellington debut.

    "description": "Meet the women behind The Girls Uninterrupted and Kiwi Yarns \u2014 bold, brilliant, and refreshingly real. Brodie, Gracie, and Caitlin each bring their own spark, sass, and storytelling to the mic, making a vibrant blend of laughs, heart, and unfiltered conversation. With backgrounds spanning journalism, broadcasting, and even nursing, these three besties are as relatable as they are remarkable \u2014 and they\u2019re not afraid to say exactly what you\u2019re thinking.\n\nBrodie is 17-million-miles-an-hour, and if you were looking up \u201cshy, introverted wallflower\u201d, you would not find her anywhere near it. She is an award-winning journalist and podcaster who has had a successful, exciting career as a broadcaster in New Zealand for 18 years. She loves to run slightly uncomfortable long distances, has a real passion for gin and has been single for 923 years. She was once a champion surf lifesaver and spent a few years in the New Zealand Army. There\u2019s never a dull moment with this independent media powerhouse.\n\nGracie is a wee pocket rocket originally hailing from the mighty Waikato. Currently living in Auckland, with her husband Ali and beautiful boys Frank and Otis, she has an extensive career in journalism and New Zealand media industries. She loves fitness, fashion, animals, and cooking. Once an accomplished equestrian who represented New Zealand overseas, Gracie is also extremely passionate about fashion and the arts and doesn\u2019t need an excuse to get dolled up for any occasion. Her drink of choice? A dirty martini, extra olives.\n\nCaitlin Marett is a small-town girl who, after ten years in radio, decided to leave her job as executive producer of ZM\u2019s Fletch, Vaughan and Megan to pursue her dream of helping people by becoming a nurse. She\u2019s obsessed with ros\u00e9, watching Friends on repeat and always finds herself in inexplicably weird situations. Caitlin would love a husband (she has a WONDERFUL boyfriend) and loves love so much that she became a marriage celebrant, which doesn\u2019t help with her ability to cry at everything. She tries to live ethically and wants to be a vegan but can\u2019t stop eating cheese. Just your average millennial who\u2019s a basic bitch with a big heart."

    "description": "Photography \u2013 The Art of Paying Attention\nIn this lecture Anne Noble will discuss modes of collaborative practice across a series of projects that spans her work with bees as well as current projects concerning the environmental degradation of our waterways. In 2023 Anne Noble was commissioned by Ng\u0101i Tahu to create an archive of images that would reveal the deteriorating state of freshwater across South Island waterways and the resulting impact on mahinga kai customs and practices. These photographs supported the Ng\u0101i Tahu Statement of Claim heard recently in the High Court in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, seeking recognition of Rangatiratanga (authority) over wai m\u0101ori (fresh water) within Ng\u0101i Tahu takiw\u0101. An exhibition, drawing on the archive and created collaboratively is currently showing in \u014ctepoti, at the Dunedin Public Art Gallery.\nFree entry, however bookings are advised. Doors open at 6.15pm, Lecture at 6.30pm. Lecture will finish at 8pm, please join us for refreshments afterwards.\nAnne Noble has been at the forefront of photographic practice in New Zealand since the early 1980s, creating bodies of work that mark sustained engagement with particular places, sites, histories, species and more recently the environmental degradation of land and water. Her images are known for their beauty, complexity and conceptual rigour and for their persistent inquiry into the ways photography impacts our perception, understanding and relationship to the natural world. Anne Noble is Professor Emerita of Fine Arts (Photography) at Massey University, Wellington and is the recipient of numerous awards including the 31st Higashikawa Photography Award (2015), an Arts Foundation Laureate Award (2009) and US National Science Foundation Artists and Writers Award (2008). She has exhibited widely both nationally and internationally and her work is held in collections throughout the world.\nThis year's lecture is one of a number of events celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Photography programme at Te Kunenga ki P\u016brehuroa Massey University.\nThe Peter Turner Memorial Lecture was established in 2008, in the memory of the late Peter Turner historian, curator and former editor of Creative Camera magazine who came from the UK to live in NZ in 1981. His contributions to the medium of photography during his time in New Zealand spanned curatorial work, writing, reviewing and teaching. He is remembered for his passion for the medium, support of photographers and their work and his special love of practices he termed lyric, transcendent or poetic documentary photography. Founded on reflections on this legacy the annual Peter Turner Lecture is conceived as a means to broaden discussions about the social and cultural value of the medium of photography today \u2013 as an expanded field inclusive of a broad range of lens based media and approaches.\nIn association with the Peter Turner Lecture a fund has been established by the Massey University Foundation to support the Peter Turner Scholarship that was launched in association with the lecture and each year provides a postgraduate student scholarship for a student engaging with social and cultural issues through the medium of photography in its broadest sense.\nThe Peter Turner Fund has been established by the Massey University Foundation to grow the support this scholarship can offer young photographers aspiring for a career the lens based arts."

Brodie, Gracie, and Caitlin each bring their own spark, sass, and storytelling to the mic, making a vibrant blend of laughs, heart, and unfiltered conversation. With backgrounds spanning journalism, broadcasting, and even nursing, these three besties are as relatable as they are remarkable \u2014 and they\u2019re not afraid to say exactly what you\u2019re thinking.\n\nBrodie is 17-million-miles-an-hour, and if you were looking up \u201cshy, introverted wallflower\u201d, you would not find her anywhere near it. She is an award-winning journalist and podcaster who has had a successful, exciting career as a broadcaster in New Zealand for 18 years. She loves to run slightly uncomfortable long distances, has a real passion for gin and has been single for 923 years. She was once a champion surf lifesaver and spent a few years in the New Zealand Army. There\u2019s never a dull moment with this independent media powerhouse.\n\nGracie is a wee pocket rocket originally hailing from the mighty Waikato. Currently living in Auckland, with her husband Ali and beautiful boys Frank and Otis, she has an extensive career in journalism and New Zealand media industries. She loves fitness, fashion, animals, and cooking. Once an accomplished equestrian who represented New Zealand overseas, Gracie is also extremely passionate about fashion and the arts and doesn\u2019t need an excuse to get dolled up for any occasion. Her drink of choice? A dirty martini, extra olives.\n\nCaitlin Marett is a small-town girl who, after ten years in radio, decided to leave her job as executive producer of ZM\u2019s Fletch, Vaughan and Megan to pursue her dream of helping people by becoming a nurse. She\u2019s obsessed with ros\u00e9, watching Friends on repeat and always finds herself in inexplicably weird situations. Caitlin would love a husband (she has a WONDERFUL boyfriend) and loves love so much that she became a marriage celebrant, which doesn\u2019t help with her ability to cry at everything. She tries to live ethically and wants to be a vegan but can\u2019t stop eating cheese. Just your average millennial who\u2019s a basic bitch with a big heart."

In three short hours, learn to craft an amazing pair of textured metal earrings - from scratch!\n\nOver this taster class, you\u2019ll be guided through the process of heating and texturing metal, cutting and shaping with traditional jewellery tools. After completing this class, you will have one pair of beautiful earrings to wear away or gift to someone special!\n\nYou will practice on smaller texture samples to work out what texture and what metal you want to go with, and then move on to creating your earrings in warm copper, yellow brass and sterling silver - with solid sterling silver earring hooks or posts.\n\nYour class materials pack includes everything you need for the class to make a super cool pair of beautiful earrings. You are welcome to purchase extra materials for larger pieces at the studio.\n\nWe use quality pre-made sterling silver earring wires, or earring posts with silicone stud backs for these taster classes so that you can focus on making the main part of the earrings and know that your findings will be just perfect.\n\nKids aged 12 (or so) are welcome to attend the class, but an enrolled parent or caregiver must accompany anyone under the age of 16."

In this collaborative workshop, we\u2019ll explore how we think about natural hazard risk and resilience\u2014through shape, texture, and place.\nBy treating the city as a model we can mold, you\u2019ll gain new insights into scale, design, and the ways we interpret our shared environment. No experience is needed\u2014just bring your curiosity, your observational eye, and a willingness to work with others.\nThe clay city model of the Wellington CBD you help create will be a central reference point throughout the Critical Signals series.\nWe suggest making a koha of around $5 to cover materials used in this event. \nAbout the host\nMair\u00e9ad de R\u00f3iste is an Associate Professor at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington, specialising in geospatial science. Her work uses maps, spatial data, and hands-on crafting methods to help people understand places, make decisions, and communicate complex ideas clearly.

We\u2019re performing pieces by composers, arrangers, and lyricists from the wider Wellington area whose work deserves to be heard more often.\n\nWe begin with tributes to two influential figures we\u2019ve lost: Jenny McLeod and lyricist Shirley Murray. Then we move into works by people we\u2019ve sung with, worked with, and deeply admire. Rosemary Russell contributes three pieces. Jonathan Berkahn, who played organ at our last concert, has two featured works: a Nunc Dimittis and Magnificat.\n\nCadence Chung, recipient of our 2023 K\u0101piti Chorale Performance Award, returns to sing with us, this time performing her own composition for voice, flute, and piano, as well as joining the choir for other pieces. We're glad to have her back.\n\nOur director Eric Sidoti brings a new arrangement of a song by Six60, adding a fresh and familiar note to the evening.\n\nWe\u2019ll close with Mass in E Minor by Thomas Nikora, another musician we\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with. Thomas sang in the choir at a previous concert and has accompanied some of our rehearsals, and now we\u2019re performing his Mass with the largest choir to present it to date. It\u2019s a bold, expressive work that shows the depth and versatility of a composer equally at home performing, conducting, and writing music. We\u2019re proud to be singing it.\n\nJoin us on Saturday 9 August at 4 PM at St Paul\u2019s Church, Paraparaumu.\nThis concert starts one hour later than usual. Bring a friend, enjoy a winter afternoon of music, and help us fill the church. These are works we believe in, and we can\u2019t wait to share them with you.\n\nMusic Director: Eric Sidoti\nAssistant Music Director: Ann-Marie Stapp\nSoprano Solo: Cadence Chung\nFlute: Malu Jonas\nPiano: Phillip O\u2019Malley\n\nDate: Saturday 9 August 2025\nTime: 4:00 PM\nVenue: St Paul\u2019s Church, Kapiti Road, Paraparaumu\n\nPrinted tickets will soon be available from Moby Dickens\u2019 (Paraparaumu Beach), Jenoa (Waikanae), and Books & Co (\u014ctaki), or by emailing tickets@kapitichorale.org.nz or calling (021) 261 2749."

Carol Bean \u2013 vocals and guitar, Costa Botes \u2013 guitar(s), George Packard \u2013 upright bass, and Andrew Grayson \u2013 drums. \nEnglish-born, California-raised, Carol was influenced by the West Coast music of the 60s and the blues of Mississippi John Hurt, Mance Lipscomb, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, and Doc Watson. At LA\u2019s Ash Grove and McCabe\u2019s Music Store she was taught her picking style from a young Ry Cooder who encouraged her to buy the Martin guitar she still plays today. Carol has fronted several bands in New Zealand and recorded 3 studio albums, all on Spotify.

For the last two decades he has created a run of films celebrating individuals who are quirky, creative, passionate, and above all, persistent (Struggle No More, The Last Dogs of Winter, Act of Kindness, Angie, When The Cows Come Home).  These films have included studies of musicians (Paddy Burgin's Wooden Box Band, Nigel Gavin\u2019s Circus, and The Shot Band/ Hobnails @ The Paramount Theatre) because Costa has been a persistent closet musician himself. He has had stints with Chris and Eva Prowse, and Carol Bean's Mount Misery String Band. When he was younger, Costa wanted to move his fingers really fast. Now he just tries to put them in the right place, song by song, and man - does he ever. \u201cTasty\u201d, \u201cAmazing\u201d, \u201cGreat playing\u201d.\nSee Costa Botes | NZ On Screen & Costa Botes Lone Pine Films (vimeo.com)\nGeorge is a professional musician and tutor on Whitireia Polytechnic\u2019s Music Programme, trained classically on the cello. George\u2019s first improvisational experiences were playing ukulele along with the Rolling Stones, John Mayall and The Band (in his bedroom).  With little market for improvisational ukulele he took up the double bass.\nGeorge enjoys playing in bands that push the envelope and give expression to the human soul. He has played extensively in many Wellington groups (including currently with the Rag Poets band), appearing a number of times for the Wellington International Festival of the Arts, undertaking national tours for Chamber Music New Zealand, and backing overseas artists in New Zealand. His playing ranges from classical to jazz, to Latin, to ethnic fusion to Americana and country. He believes - at a fundamental level - that music is about human beings making sense of the world and themselves, and about helping heal the world.\nAndrew is also the drummer for the band Ghostplane (Beneath the Sleepy Lagoon; Panther Valley Country Club (Arch Hill Records), which includes Phoenix Foundation members). Not only has he joined our team, but his passion is surfing - so let's say he's the youngest and the fittest.\nNot for profit, supporting our dedicated musicians.

    "description": "A story runs through it -What is the voice that mobilises readers?\n\nResearch explains why certain forms of storytelling are especially effective at leaving readers with the desire to act on ideas. If you want readers to walk with you into issues that are important to you, this is your chance to find out how.\n\nMarilyn will share some evidence regarding effective voice and content, along with suggestions to apply the research. You\u2019ll read a few samples and have time to jot down and discuss your own starting points. Finally, there will be time to talk through some strategies to help you prepare for the facts of issue-based speech in this time.\n\nThis information applies to memoir, fictional stories, and many other forms of communication that aim to galvanise an audience. The principles are beneficial regardless of your experience, because all communication is based on finding a voice."

    "description": "Next-Level BA: How to maximise your value-add\nA half-day workshop for Business Analysts looking to take things to the next level.\nWhat this course isn't...\nThis isn't about your traditional 'BA' skills - we won't be learning to write better requirements, user stories, or processes!\nWhat this course is...\nThis is a course focused on a mindset shift (with the tools to back it up) to enable you to add more value as a BA. As projects become more ambiguous and agile, the expectations on a BA are changing in a way gives us the opportunity to make a bigger impact - if we have the skills to take advantage...\nWorkshop scope:\n0. Intro / \u2018Next-Level BA\u2019 definition\nLearn what makes a \u201cNext-Level BA\u201d \u2013 someone who jumps into projects early, stays focused on outcomes, regularly steps back to see the bigger picture, acts with purpose, and takes the initiative to lead. This introduction pushes BAs to move beyond the limiting \u201cI\u2019m just a BA\u201d mindset and embrace a more proactive approach that doesn\u2019t require formal authority to make an impact.\n1. The evolving role of a BA\nSee how the BA role has changed from working on clearly defined, waterfall projects to handling small, ambiguous initiatives with constant change. We\u2019ll look at how design now happens alongside build, how BAs wear multiple hats, and why organisations need BAs to be leaders who can handle uncertainty rather than just task-executors. Understand the difference between working \u201cin\u201d versus \u201con\u201d a project to maximise your value.\n2. Setting up good decision-making in a project\nDevelop ways to establish what success looks like from day one of any project. This practical framework drives better outcomes by creating alignment, building trust, and enabling smarter decisions throughout the project. You\u2019ll create your own set of ready-to-use success criteria that you can bring out in workshops to guide projects toward meaningful outcomes rather than just outputs.\n3. Defining the pathway for problem solving\nGet to grips with \u201cdefinedness\u201d \u2013 understanding where your project sits on the spectrum from well-defined to highly undefined problems. Build a playbook for tackling different types of problems, knowing when to use existing approaches, when to adapt them, and when to create new ones. This thoughtful approach buys you time while you learn more about complex problems and increases your chances of success.\n4. Ensuring the right things are being worked on\nGo beyond \u201cI delivered what I was asked to\u201d and make sure you\u2019re not just doing things right, but doing the right things. Create a practical checklist to assess whether initiatives will truly add value, address root problems, and align with what the business can actually implement. Learn to question scope consistently and push back when necessary to avoid wasting time on projects that won\u2019t deliver real benefits.\n5. Risk tolerance / ensuring you are adding value\nFind the sweet spot between risk and cost by knowing when you\u2019ve gathered enough information to proceed. Avoid analysis paralysis by tailoring your approach based on who will be affected, what systems are involved, how easily changes can be reversed, and your organisation\u2019s history with similar work. Design approaches that reduce the impact of mistakes, allowing for faster, more cost-effective decision-making.\n6. \u2018Selling\u2019 in the decision-making process\nBuild a clear approach to influencing decisions through effective storytelling. Learn to establish the need for change, reinforce what success looks like, address potential barriers upfront, present your solution convincingly, and provide a clear path forward. Create decision-maker profiles to help customise your approach to different stakeholders based on whether they focus more on the journey or destination, respond to emotion or logic, and other key characteristics.\n7.

Don\u2019t miss this opportunity to hear from one of New Zealand\u2019s leading researchers - this promises to be a fascinating and thought-provoking evening. \nProfessor Richard Beasley CNZM FRSNZ, the 2024 Rutherford Medal winner, will highlight ten influential research programmes that have challenged long-held clinical assumptions, advanced medical knowledge, and directly influenced patient care:\nShould fever be treated?\nWhat is the optimal amount of oxygen for critically ill patients?\nAre party pills safe, and do they affect driving performance?\nDoes smoking cannabis cause lung cancer?\nIs sitting for long periods at work or during recreation a risk factor for blood clots?\nShould preservatives be included in asthma nebuliser solutions?\nIs \u2018watchful waiting\u2019 preferable to surgery for a collapsed lung?\nWhat are the underlying disease processes of asthma?\nWhat was the cause of the epidemic of asthma deaths in New Zealand?\nAre adult asthma treatments suitable for children?\nThe answers to many of these research questions were unexpected. The research raises significant regulatory and legal issues. It also exposes the limited evidence of the benefit and safety of many fundamental approaches to the clinical management of common disorders, and the gaps in knowledge, particularly in children.\nJoin us for this fascinating presentation that will illustrate the unpredictable nature of research and its influence to reshape our understanding.\nBiography\nProfessor Richard Beasley, renown academic, physician, and researcher, is the founder and director of the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand (MRINZ). Richard is committed to challenging medical dogma and increasing knowledge through undertaking high quality clinical research which has the real potential to change clinical practice and reduce the burden of disease in Aotearoa New Zealand and globally.\nAlongside his role at the MRINZ, Richard is a physician at Wellington Regional Hospital, and maintains close academic links through his professorial appointments at the University of Southampton, UK, Te Herenga Waka\u2014Victoria University of Wellington, and the University of Otago. Richard was Deputy Chair of the Health Research Council of New Zealand from 2010 to 2016 and has had a longstanding medical advisory role with the Asthma and Respiratory Foundation of New Zealand, chairing the adolescent and adult asthma guidelines group. He is dedicated to workforce training, having supervised and mentored hundreds of medical research fellows over the last three decades, many of whom obtained postgraduate MD and PhD degrees and now hold prominent academic and clinical positions in Aotearoa New Zealand and around the world.\nRichard is one of New Zealand\u2019s most experienced clinician researchers, with over 780 publications, including many high impact publications in the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. Richard was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to medical research in 2008; elected a Fellow of the Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi of New Zealand in 2015; awarded the Sir Charles Hercus Medal in 2016 in recognition of the impact of his research, the Beaven Medal in 2019 in recognition of his translational research, and was awarded the Rutherford Medal by the Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi in 2024 for revolutionising the treatment of asthma worldwide.\nSeats are limited, so book early to avoid missing out.\n\nSupported by Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi and the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand (MRINZ)"

The annual festival presents over 150 feature films, short films, and documentaries. \nThere\u2019s always a huge and diverse selection of films to choose from. Artistic Director Paolo Bertolin and his team of film curators have scoured the world for independent, quirky, and award-winning movies. These include a politically charged near-future drama from Brazil, an Australian animated queer space opera, and a restored \u201870s horror classic. There\u2019s also a haunting psychological drama set in remote Aotearoa. \nPaolo says these films are indicative of the energy shaping this year\u2019s festival. They provide a taste of the adventurous and memorable stories awaiting audiences. \u201cThese films speak powerfully to the moment we are living in. They ask big questions, take risks, and remind us why cinema matters more than ever.\u201d"

Her most recent touring project, The Bush & the Birds Tour, travelled throughout NZ in support of conservation organisation; Forest & Bird. An ode to her late Grandfather\u2019s love of the land, the tour generated over $2000 in donations for Forest & Bird.\n\nJenny grew up in a home and family of music and often tours with her sisters, The Mitchell Twins, and country music loving Dad, Ron Mitchell. After growing up with a musical diet of The Chicks, Hank Williams and Dolly Parton, Jenny penned her first songs at the age of 11 after a trip to Ireland where she connected with her Irish heritage and explored the immigration story of her Irish born Grandparents. A few years down the track, Jenny performed original work on the TV show New Zealand's Got Talent, was placed 3rd and went onto crowdfund and release her first album at the age of 15. In 2017, she was crowned the overall winner of the NZ Gold Guitar Awards which kickstarted the professional chapter of her career, leading to her Aotearoa Music Award Winning album 'Wildfires\u2019 produced by Tasmania\u2019s Matt Fell.\n\nWith a sound that No Depression describes as, \u201cpoetry that dominates a beautiful melody,\u201d Jenny Mitchell is comfortable with a country twang or softly spoken ballad and is rapidly capturing fans across the globe."

    "description": "Social Media Marketing for Small Enterprises: Visual Impact\nWhether you are just starting out or already running a business, having an online and social media presence is essential. While most of us know in theory that we need a marketing plan, a social media strategy, a consistent post schedule, and engaging reels for TikTok, the reality is that every business is unique, and your approach should reflect that.\n One constant across all online presences is the importance of visuals\u2014photographs, images, and graphics. With attention spans shorter than ever, your audience will move on within seconds if they are not engaged\u2014they see images first and then only start reading the text. If you can't captivate their attention, you risk losing potential customers. Generic and overused stock images, or AI-generated visuals, can do more harm than good, even if they seem like an affordable option.\n In this course, we will explore different types of content suitable for your specific needs and audiences, how to create it or where to source it, how to develop the right visual strategy for your online presence, what tools to use, and how to implement it immediately. By the end of the course, you will have an outstanding online presence.\nA condition of enrolment is that you must provide photo id when you attend the workshop.\n By the end of the four-week course, you\u2019ll be able to:\n Recognise the critical role of visuals in social media marketing.\nChoose the most effective type of visual content for your brand.\nProduce high-quality, engaging visuals using various tools and techniques.\nImplement a cohesive visual strategy across multiple social media platforms.\nAssess and refine your visual strategy to maximise engagement and build trust with your audience.\nNote:  Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

Fans can register for access at livenation.co.nz. \nDominating festivals not only in New Zealand but around the world, their success has even seen the pair become the first New Zealand act to play at Belgium\u2019s Tomorrowland festival \u2014 one of the most prestigious electronic music festivals in the world.\nOne of the duo\u2019s earliest champions was renowned producer Diplo. The duo, consisting of Will Thomas and Nick Chrisp, found him on the streets of Auckland, New Zealand and slipped a USB through the window of his SUV. Their efforts paid off when he soon responded and offered a coveted co-sign by playing early tracks \u201cNo More\u201d and \u201cHold On\u201d on his Diplo & Friends BBC Radio 1 Show. In the aftermath, SACHI exploded as a homegrown phenomenon, achieving two chart-topping platinum-certified singles, \u201cNo More\u201d and \u201cShelter,\u201d as well as an official remix of Lorde\u2019s hit single \u201cGreen Light\u201d alongside Montell2099.\nBetween 2016 and 2021, SACHI rolled out a series of three EPs: Lunch With Bianca, Nights With Ruby, and Breakfast With Ella, amassing more than 50 million streams across the trio of projects. Each of the EPs\u2019 title characters represents a different phase of SACHI\u2019s discography \u2014 from their introduction on Lunch With Bianca, to establishing themselves internationally on Nights With Ruby (created while living in LA pre-pandemic), to the full-circle evolution of their most refined and lustrous body of work to date, Breakfast With Ella. While each project takes listeners on an eclectic journey traversing club-ready BPMs from dazzling four-on-the-floor disco-house rhythms to euphoric powerhouse dance-pop hooks, the thread tying each installment of the celebrated trilogy together is found in SACHI\u2019s intention to create dance music whose emotion is as convincing as its ability to make you move.\n2023 saw SACHI tour their headline show across their home territory to sold-out crowds and introduced \u201cCLUB SACHI\u201d \u2014 a sold-out three-date 360 club experience for fans. Collaborating closely with Human Person, the LA-based creative house behind Swedish House Mafia, SZA, and Billie Eilish\u2019s touring live shows, SACHI\u2019s live show has been elevated to surreal new heights. \u201cEver since we started making music, we wanted to create moments to share with friends,\u201d the boys explain. \u201cWe want to give everyone an uplifting and euphoric experience. Our music paints this picture of different energies coming together as a whole.\u201d\nAfter back-to-back New Zealand festival headline sets this past summer, SACHI are working towards their highly anticipated new music, which promises to return to the heart of their rave-oriented roots while always continuing to keep their audience guessing \u2014 they might even get a sneak peek of this magic during these upcoming tour dates.\nSACHI - WELLINGTON AND AUCKLAND AUGUST 2025 \n Presented by Live Nation and George FM\nSAN FRAN, WELLINGTON                      THURSDAY, AUGUST 21\nSTUDIO THE VENUE, AUCKLAND         SATURDAY, AUGUST 23 \n\nTICKETS ON SALE TUESDAY 15 JULY AT 12PM\n\nMastercard and One NZ Presales: Fri 11 Jul, 12pm > Mon 14 Jul, 12pm local\n Live Nation Presale: Mon 14 Jul, 1pm local > Tue 15 Jul, 11am local\n General Public Onsale: Tue 15 Jul, 12pm local\n\n For complete tour & ticket information, visit: livenation.co.nz\n \n Follow SACHI\n FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | YOUTUBE | TIKTOK | SPOTIFY\n \n "

It can be funny and thought-provoking. Now they\u2019re taking the podcast on the road and visiting Wellington\u2019s Michael Fowler Centre. You can expect all the stuff you\u2019re used to: deep k\u014drero , big laughs, and a few tears. It\u2019s also likely there\u2019ll be some spontaneous (and questionable) singing. \nFrom humble beginnings in a garage, The Morning Shift has had an amazing rise to the upper reaches of the podcast charts in Aotearoa. The trio\u2019s brand of humorous and honest musings has earned them thousands of daily listeners. Rally the crew, book the babysitter, and get ready for a night that promises to shift you. As Jordan says, \u201cI want people to leave with laughter still in their belly and hope in their hearts. Lessspushhhh.\u201d"

The English Locust describes his sound as \" Bob Dylan if he was goth\", fusing the melancholy poeticism of groups like the Smiths and Joy Division with the musical stylings of folk and Delta Blues.\n Jim is a veteran of the Wellington Music scene, holding a bachelor's degree in commercial music. His previous band The Vermillion Poets, placed second in the national New Zealand battle of the bands in 2019 where he also won an award for best vocalist. With his current group SHE, he has released three singles to critical acclaim from NZ Music.net and was the organiser for their festival SPECTRE FEST for two years. With his solo project The English Locust, he was a regional finalist in this years Battle of the bands, being the only soloist to make it that far in this years competition. He plans to release his debut single late 2025 or early 2026. \nAnt\u00fc M\u0101rama is a musical collaboration between Paulette Mankoch Soriano (Chile), Jim Bailey (UK) Claudio (Chile), Andres del Vilar (Chile), David (Canary islands) and Catherine Ireland (NZ). The band evolved from a previous incarnation, The flying jaranas, who played primarily Son Jarocho, a traditional music from Veracruz on the East Coast of Mexico. Since then, members have come and gone, and Ant\u00fc M\u0101rama has broadened its horizons to play folk music from all around Latin America, as well as original compositions written by lead singer Paulette. The group's ethos is represented by the name - Ant\u00fc is the Mabudungun word for sun, while M\u0101rama is the Te reo M\u0101ori word for Moon. The group combines both the life-giving energy and vitality of the sun with the deeper emotions and more reflective energy of the Moon. Ant\u00fc M\u0101rama is a synthesis of the group's diverse backgrounds and musical experiences, united by a love of playing music, and a desire to share the rich folk tradition of Latin America with a local audience."

'River Dark' is O'Leary's debut. \u2018Tender, steadfast and unraveling\u2019, it shot to #9 on the Aotearoa Official Albums Chart, features the SRN #1 singles 'Baby I'm a Singer' and 'Baptised at the Desktop Computer' and has been featured by RNZ, the SRN and Rolling Stone Magazine. O\u2019Leary will be joined in P\u014dneke by her trio, Amy Borovich (HINA, Anna Coddington) and Nava Tekela-Pule (Erny Belle, LEAO).\n\nT\u0101maki Makaurau singer-songwriter and musician GRETA O'LEARY writes with clarity of vision, making introspective observations that seamlessly interlock with her spare, spacious and enthralling songcraft. Through soaring instrumentation, astute and occasionally absurd lyrics of self-reflection and her poignant voice, her debut is \u2018slightly spooky, wryly funny, and expertly written\u2019 (Tony Stamp).\n\nCelebrated local songwriter GRETA O'LEARY is releasing her highly anticipated debut album RIVER DARK. The obscure, dreamlike record was created alongside producer Jol Mulholland at LAB Studios, with Greta's hypnotic songwriting and unmistakable vocals accentuated through the skillful musicianship of instrumentalists Cass Basil (Tiny Ruins, The Veils), Alastair Deverick (Boycrush), Callum Passells (Hans Pucket) and Anita Clark (Motte). Listeners are invited deeper into Greta\u2019s immersive and enthralling world.\n\n\u201cMy first record, a collection of personal, ridiculous and truth telling songs. It took a long time to get here. I was a child shy and unclear, completely confused, absolutely not onboard with future, with goals or activity. I was in the field below the house, I was at the pond with the dog, I played make believe longer than most. I was taught to be quiet.\u201d\n\n*****************************************\n\nRiver Dark the album - https://music.drm.co.nz/river-dark\n\nBaby I\u2019m a Singer Music Video (Greta O\u2019Leary) -\nhttps://youtu.be/Wjy8xmq6JKs?si=c5xnXtxQ6-Yfzk5x\n\nGreta O'Leary Tour Dates\n16 August - Auckland Guide Hall - Auckland\n22 August - Secret Show - Whanganui*\n23 August - San Fran - Wellington*\n24 August - Sacred Heart - Greytown*\n30 August - Stewart St - Raglan*\n31 August - Leigh Sawmill - Leigh\n3 September - Dawn - \u014cakura*\n4 September - Hamilton - Last Place\n* (trio show)\n\nTickets $25\nTo reserve your tickets email: commonground.wai@gmail.com"

    "description": "Laidlaw Centre for Church Leadership exists to love and serve the Church of Aotearoa New Zealand by providing her leaders with the tools, support, and guidance they need to flourish. \nJoin us for a one day conference as we gather with leaders from across the region to connect, be inspired and encouraged, and discuss issues relevant to the Church in Aotearoa. The event runs from 9am to 2:30pm. Morning tea and lunch is included.\nTheme: Stewarding Renewal\nOur 2025 Leaders Days explore emerging reports across New Zealand and the globe of increasing openness to faith in Christ, and in some cases significant growth in church attendance and baptisms, led by younger generations; and how church leaders might respond.\n\"In churches across society something amazing is happening, challenging long held predictions about the future of Christianity in the twenty-first century. Where we once saw ageing congregations and a steady decline in attendance, we now see dramatic growth, led by the young. Where we once saw apathy or even hostility to Christianity and the Bible we see increased openness.\" - Bible Society UK\nIn the United States a similar trend is emerging:\n\"Undeniably there is renewed interest in Jesus,\" says David Kinnaman, CEO of Barna. \"This is the clearest trend we've seen in more than a decade pointing to spiritual renewal \u2014 and it's the first time Barna has recorded such spiritual interest being led by younger generations.\" - Barna Group, USA\nOn Easter Sunday in New Zealand, St Patricks Cathedral in Auckland baptized 350 people. Testimonies are emerging from churches across Aotearoa of an openness to faith, responses from people previously not interested in church, and a curiosity about Christ and Christianity among non-believers, particularly young people.\nAs church and Christian leaders in Aotearoa New Zealand, how might we respond in our contexts?\nHow could we participate in what the Spirit is doing? What does this mean for sustainability of people and programmes, and for our discipleship teams? How can we discern the best response to the opportunities presented by this context? How can we stir hunger for renewal in our time and place, without unhealthy comparison?\nWe are gathering leaders from across Aotearoa in four locations for a one day conference to discuss these questions. There will be opportunity to hear testimonies of renewal happening in churches in Aotearoa, and share your thoughts with other leaders as we gather \u2014 we pray you will walk away encouraged, inspired, and with fresh vision for the days ahead.\nWe hope to see you there!\nProgramme:\nSession One: Emerging Renewal\nMore and more, stories are emerging of green shoots in surprising places: tales of people without church backgrounds turning up at church quite unexpectedly, more frequent conversations with those curious about Jesus, dramatic spiritual encounters that we could never have facilitated. There is a sense that the upheaval of Covid, global political shifts, and financial uncertainty in recent years has shifted something: the fragmentation and failure of secularism and new atheism was perhaps preparing the ground. It seems like something is happening - a quiet renewal.\nWhat does this mean for the communities we lead? How can we, as leaders, steward these firstfruits of renewal? How can we lean in to what the Spirit is doing in our own contexts?\nSession Two: Stories of Renewal\nIn this panel discussion, local pastors and leaders share stories of how they are seeing that God has been moving \u2014 stirring renewal and hope, unexpected shifts in discipleship and salvations, and how they are responding.\nSession Three: Renewal and Fruitfulness\nTime and time again throughout history, renewal has come through small communities making radical commitments to the way of Jesus. What can renewal movements throughout history teach us about renewal in our own moment? What helps? What doesn't? What does it look like to be faithful in our time and place?\nSession Four: Renewal Conversations\nWhat does it look like to steward renewal in our churches? This session focuses on practical responses to renewal and discussion around how the Church in Aotearoa can partner with what the Spirit is doing.\nSpeakers:\nSam Harvey, 24-7 Prayer New Zealand\nSam Harvey is the founding and Lead Pastor of Bay Vineyard Church and the National Coordinator for 24-7 Prayer NZ. He has been in full-time ministry since graduating from BCNZ (now Laidlaw) in 2003. He is passionate about coming alongside church leaders to encourage strong prayer cultures in churches. His 24-7 role gives him a front row seat to a lot of what God is doing among our churches. Sam is married to Jenn and they have three lively sons. Sam loves good food, good music and good waves. We are excited to have him with us!\nRoshan Allpress, Laidlaw College\nDr Roshan Allpress has led Laidlaw College as National Principal/Chief Executive since 2017. He holds History degrees from Canterbury and Oxford, focusing on religious reform, philanthropy, and theology\u2019s social impact. He co-founded the Compass (now Venn) Foundation and has extensive experience in non-profit leadership. Raised in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, he and his wife Lottie have three children and now live in Auckland.\nLocal Panels\nIn each location we will be joined by local pastors and leaders sharing experiences of renewal from their contexts.

Or have you been riding for ages, but have always been scared to fix anything yourself?\nAre you unsure of how to pump your tyres, or how much oil your chain needs? Find yourself fumbling for words when trying to describe that clunking sound to the guy in the bike shop?\nThis one day course lays bare the nuts and bolts of bicycle mechanics for absolute beginners, as well as those with a little experience. Through practical experience working with your own bicycle, you will find out what needs to be done to keep it running smoothly. We\u2019ll cover what to look out for when things start to wear out, and how to check for problems, so you can be confident your bicycle is safe to ride.

No question is a stupid question!\nBringing a bike to work on is essential, preferably one that you are riding regularly, because the best way to learn is by building familiarity with your own ride. E-bikes are welcome, although the extra weight can mean they are more challenging to work on. Regardless of whether your bike is in pristine condition, or desperately in need of TLC, it is welcome on the course \u2013 bikes showing a bit more wear can be useful for the learning of the whole group.\nBring your pushbike along on the day.

    "description": "Ready to take these new tracks on the road, The Grogans new album Stagger is\nout, plus the band are excited to announce a headline tour across New Zealand.\nExploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different\nsounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, it came\nfrom this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to\ntrack, explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the\nband then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in\nWellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy\nAuckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also\nbe playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New\nYork for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of\nmental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song,\nand more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to\na new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the\ntitle suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019.\nAdding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier\nMan\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that striving to be a better\nand happier person should be a goal for everyone. \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019\nis an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album\ncloser \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the\nbeast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and\ntouring.\n\nMixing on the road definitely added something different to this album.\nUsually, I\u2019m in the same spot whilst mixing and can come and go from each\ntrack mentally, but this time the album was attached to us at the hip. We would\nbring a set up through most of America and record/mix in green rooms and on\nthe bandwagon. It was definitely worth it, as we had to work with what we had\nto finish the album. Only being able to reference mixes on headphones and\nJBL speakers towards the end of the album process was definitely harder than\nin a studio. However, as a band, we have never really been able to sit still, so it\nworked nicely. Each mix has its own personality, and I guess that\u2019s what we\nwanted for this staggered album. - The Grogan\u2019s Quin Grunden on mixing and\nengineering the album on the road across the US & Canada through June-July 2024.\n\nStream Stagger Album: https://thegrogans.lnk.to/stagger\n\nIncluded in Rolling Stone\u2019s Future of Music 2025 and described by triple j as 'one\nof the most consistently hardworking live acts in the country\u2019, The Grogans\ncommitment to making incredibly varied, distinct music, sharing good experiences at\ntheir live show and genuine elation on playing together is clear to see and explains\nwhy they are one of Australia\u2019s brightest bands. In recent years, they have delighted\ntheir international fans with a headline 2024 tour across Europe, Ireland, and the UK,\na stop at the Netherlands\u2019 Misty Fields Festival, joining Ocean Alley on their North\nAmerican Summer Tour, and more. Never ones for slowing down, 2024 was filled\nwith local shows, sharing the stage with Teen Jesus and The Jean Teasers for their\n\u2018Fix It With Salt\u2019 tour, and a 5th anniversary tour of their LP \u2018Just What You Want.\n\nTickets for all dates go on sale Wednesday 28 May at midday."

    "description": "  Financial Planning for Retirement\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern.  They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support,\nAnd if you needed to obtain Government assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years.   But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you! \nThis course has been developed for people in their 50\u2019s or 60\u2019s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help. \nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement. \nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement. \nYou will work though a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details.  You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information. \nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.  \nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of?  If not, then this course is for you.\n[A condition of enrolment is that you must provide photo ID when you attend.\nDisclaimer:  The tutors are not financial advisors.  No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided.  A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study.  Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed.  Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\nNote:  Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\"."

Seventeen of those men were executed in Wellington and 11 are buried in Karori Cemetery.  This walking tour will visit some of their graves to account their crimes, trials and convictions. It will also visit the plots of some of the victims.\n\nThe graves are unmarked and placed in remote and disparate locations making this a tour about 2.5 hours long. The route is 2.5km and requires reasonable physical fitness due to the steep terrain and unsealed paths in places.\nThe tour contains a number of adult themes and some graphic descriptions and so is not suitable for everyone.\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee). Children under 12 are free.\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nPlease note:\nThis tour requires reasonable physical fitness and sadly is not suited for those with limited mobility. \nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you on the day by 9am by email and on our Facebook page. The booking fee is non-refundable.\nPlease dress appropriately for the conditions. While we do our best to guide you on a safe walking route, during the winter months the ground can become slippery in places.\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Karori Cemetery."

    "description": "Hailing from the music-filled streets of Melbourne, Australia, Shaun Kirk is an award-winning blues and soul troubadour recognized for his exceptional talent as a born entertainer. His unique talent has not only earned him many accolades but also much praise from fellow artists, such as three-time Grammy Award Winner Fantastic Negrito, who has declared his show as One of the best one-man shows he\u2019s ever seen!\n\nKirk's vocals exude a gritty, soulful depth that seems to transcend far beyond his years, with critics continually acclaiming him as one of the finest blues voices Australia has ever heard (Buzz Mag). Complementing his vocal artistry, Kirk's vintage guitar tones and raw grooves pay tribute to the timeless influences that have shaped his musical journey, resulting in a distinctive sound fast becoming his own.\n\nShaun\u2019s musical journey has taken him to stages all over the world, where he's not only performed but consistently sold out shows, leaving audiences enthralled by his magnetic presence. From iconic festival stages like Bluesfest Byron Bay, where he's become a familiar name, to sharing the billing with legends like Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, John Mayer, Paolo Nutini, John Butler Trio, and The Teskey Brothers; Kirk's artistic prowess is in esteemed company. Moreover, he's also had the honour of opening for household names such as blues maestro Joe Bonamassa, soul sensation Allen Stone, and the indomitable Beth Hart; further solidifying his place in the landscape of contemporary music. This remarkable journey is a testament to Kirk's unmatched talent and ability to connect with audiences across genres and generations.\n\nWHAT THE PRESS ARE SAYING ABOUT SHAUN KIRK...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to see someone bring down the house as an opener, but Australia\u2019s Shaun Kirk did exactly that. He connected with the crowd immediately\u201d\n\u2013 Soundcheck Entertainment, Canada\n\n\u201cOne of the most explosive acts Australia has to offer\u201d\n\u2013 Mixdown Magazine\n\n\u201cSimply astounding.

Kevin Bloody Wilson \u2014 Aussie Icon Tour is set to roll into The Opera House in September. He\u2019ll perform a selection of his funniest songs, and irreverent stories \u2014 all infused with his wickedly rude sense of humour. \nKevin\u2019s journey to politically incorrect stardom started in 1977. He began by changing the words to other people\u2019s songs, eventually writing some songs himself. At the time people were still being arrested for using some four-letter words in public. Audiences initially ostracised him for his rude and crude performances. Now, over 45 years later, the reverse applies. He has 350 million TikTok views, 4 million album sales, and 6 million tickets sold around the world. The 78-year-old shows no signs of slowing down. \u201cThere is just too much political correctness to incorrect!\u201d he says. "

The groundbreaking work is community-focused and community-driven. In the performance, community singers and instrumentalists stand shoulder-to-shoulder with their professional counterparts.\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he decides to punish them by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth. He gives them to the minotaur, a terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze. The youth are not willing to accept their fate. The story is about resistance, justice, and finding power in collectivism.\n\u2018The Monster in the Maze\u2019 has been praised by audiences, participants, and reviewers worldwide. Its Aotearoa debut season is directed by Anapela Polataivao. Anapela is known for directing the feature movie \u2018Red, White & Brass\u2019 (2023), and live theatre piece \u2018Wild Dogs Under My Skirt\u2019."

You share/learn/discuss the things that matter to you most - with other folk that are going through it.

This is also their chance to win back the Freedom Cup. This is gearing up to be one of the most exciting showdowns of the season after two closely fought Tests in South Africa in 2024.\nAt the 2023 Rugby World Cup, South Africa pipped the All Blacks at the post by one point in the final and took home the prize. South Africa has won the Rugby World Cup a total of four times while New Zealand has brought it home three times. They are well-matched teams so All Blacks Coach Scott Robertson will be training the boys hard. Wellington will be awash with rugby fever so make sure you\u2019re part of the action."

Shit-for-brains liberals peddling \u2018both sides\u2019 fucknuggetry as the people march for peace and their governments pour gasoline on fire. And wt actual f is a \u2018lesser\u2019 evil? Sameena Zehra is back to explore whether it's time to dust off your guillotines (even for a pacifist, it\u2019s definitely time) with dark comedy & delicious storytelling that will make you gasp and guffaw as you channel your inner homicidal pacifist to pen a culling list of your own.\nFollowing a sold out season at NZ International Comedy Festival earlier this year, Sameena is bringing this show back for one night only during TAHI festival as part of TAHI Encores season.\nContent Notes\nThis show is accessible to Blind or Low Vision folks without audio description.\nThe venue is fully accessible. \nNo loud noises or flashing lights. I will occasionally raise my voice, but will avoid shouting.\nAdult, political, and other confrontational content (see title). \nAlso... coarse language, because... lalochezia (look it up).\nSome direct chat with the audience- however, if you avert your eyes or shake your head, I will not speak directly to you.\nQueer friendly.\nSameena Zehra is an award winning comedian, storyteller, actor, writer, director and blues singer/songwriter. She is a political satirist, an intersectional feminist, and a humanist. Her humour is dark and her mind is absurd, equally at home exploring the individual experiences of daily life and the larger issues of the world we live in, creating work that is rooted in the human condition, in holding power to account, and in bringing people together in spaces that are tender and robust. She has performed her solo shows all over the world, including Edinburgh Fringe, Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Brighton Fringe, Adelaide Fringe, The Nordic Fringes, and New Zealand Fringe, where she was nominated for 'Best In Fringe' 2016, and won 'Outstanding Performer' in 2017. Before moving to Aotearoa New Zealand in 2019, Sameena lived and worked in the UK where she has performed at the National Theatre, and has toured internationally with the Royal Shakespeare Company. She performed the critically acclaimed season of her show 'Tea with Terrorists' at Circa Theatre in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, (which was nominated in the \u2018Outstanding Performer\u2019  and \u2018Best Director\u2019 categories at the Wellington Theatre Awards) before touring it at festivals around Aotearoa.\nHere's things people have said about shows Sameena has made...don't take them too seriously, it's just individuals, with individual opinions. You might have different ones (but you'll have to come to the show to find out)\n\u2018Astonishing, and frequently violent... \u2019 The Independent, UK (That's a particularly good one)\n\u2018Outstanding...a master storyteller\u2019 Rip It Up, Adelaide\n'Funny, fiery, brave and true.\u2019 Herald, Scotland\n\u2018Humour in every strand\u2019\n\u2018Left wanting the next chapter\u2019 The Latest, Brighton\n\u2018...an intimate atmosphere with all the warmth, energy and enthusiasm of a full house at the Apollo\u2019\n\u2018Fluency, intensity and vivacity... \u2019The Age, Melbourne\n\u2018...combines warmth with political passion.\u2019 Scotsgay\n\u2018... smart and sharp... a breath of fresh air... \u2019 Nicholas Holm, The Post, NZ\n\u2018 ... the wittiest and sassiest lady I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of watching.

    "description": "STEAMS is an integrated approach to learning topics of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths, and Society that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. Its aim is to teach real world skills through engaging methods whilst allowing individuals to be creative. This involves immersing tamariki into projects and activities that develop innovation and champion curiosity. STEAMS is not \u2018play based learning\u2019 but focused learning through an integrated hands-on approach allowing children to take risks and explore their own curiosity in a subject without time barriers.\nAt the Ministry of Inspiration we offer STEAMS learning each term for Year 1-8 students. Once a week students will attend a class at Waterlea Racecourse, Blenheim on TUESDAY or THURSDAY. STEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) start at 9am and finish at 2:45pm on TUESDAY. Little STEAMerS operates from 12-3 on TUESDAY. STEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) operates on THURSDAY from 9am to 245 pm. We qualify as an off-site learning programme which enables schools to record the students as \u201clearning offsite\u201d rather than absent for that day.\nInquiry, collaboration, and an emphasis on process-based learning are at the heart of the STEAM approach. Each term the classes will have a focus which drives the learning and our amazing teachers create opportunities to help each student develop their understanding, improve their skills and gain knowledge in a range of topics.\nStudents who participate in STEAM learning:\n\u00b7 think outside the box\n\u00b7 feel safe to express innovative and creative ideas\n\u00b7 feel comfortable doing hands-on learning\n\u00b7 take ownership over their learning\n\u00b7 work collaboratively with others\n\u00b7 understand the ways that science, maths, the arts, and technology work together\n\u00b7 become increasingly curious about the world around them and feel empowered to change it for the better.\nWhen does it meet, and where?\nThe school is held during school terms.\nSTEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) TUESDAY, 9-245.\nSTEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) THURSDAY, 9-245\nLittle STEAMerS (ages 5-6) TUESDAY 12-3.\nLocation:  Waterlea Racecourse, enter off of Linton St.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe students come for a paid three-week trial-as a new student you pay for that through Humanitix.\nIf both family and teacher feel there is a good fit for the child in the class, they continue for the rest of the term. You are then invoiced for the full term less the amount paid for the Trial.\nPayment is by term, with a cost of $63 per day plus GST. We have a limited number of scholarships available that are awarded on a term by term basis for those with financial need for 25% off. \nLittle STEAMerS is $25 per day plus GST.\nWill my child\u2019s school mind that they miss a day per week?\nYou will need to inform the child\u2019s school that he or she will be at STEAMS School one day per week. To date we have not encountered any issues around accommodating a child\u2019s participation in STEAMS School, and many of the region\u2019s schools are very supportive of the programme. Once enrolled, you are encouraged to inform the teacher and office staff that your child should be marked present for the day they attend STEAMS School, as they will be attending an academic school as opposed to being absent due to illness or other reasons."

After playing to over 70,000 people across the country, now comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: \u2018GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra\u2019. This one-man show stars Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow of \u2019King Kong\u2019 and \u2018The Hobbit\u2019 fame. It\u2019s sure to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s absurdities. \nWhether you\u2019re a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show dives deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, and family. Watch Mark as he explores the undeniable need to keep moving, no matter how creaky your knees may be. \n\u2018Grumpy Old Man in Lycra\u2019 is a celebration of growing older (and slightly wider) with humour, heart, and a healthy dose of spandex."

Gaining international attention after opening for one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most coveted DJs Fred again.. and remixing his song \u2018places to be\u2019 which now has over 2.6M listens on Spotify alone, MESSIE is quickly becoming one of the most exciting new names to watch in New Zealand.\nAudiences will be able to enjoy MESSIE\u2019s high-energy, electrifying set for literally the entire night - with these two shows running until the early hours of the morning. Saturday, September 13th will see her take over Auckland\u2019s Studio the Venue, before heading to Wellington\u2019s San Fran the following Saturday, September 20th.\nTickets for MESSIE\u2019s All Night Long tour in Auckland and Wellington will be available to purchase by the General Public on Friday 4th July at 12:00pm.\nMy Live Nation members will also be able to secure tickets during the presale which commences Wednesday 2nd July from 11:00am until Friday 4th July at 11:00am. Fans can register for access at livenation.co.nz.\nMESSIE is taking Aotearoa\u2019s electronic dance music scene to filthy new levels. As a former drummer, her passion for drumming was the pipeline for her falling in love with genres like Garage, Breakbeat, and Jungle. She has since expanded her sound and it\u2019s safe to say each set will keep you guessing what will come next as she effortlessly merges genres such as Baile Funk, Ghetto Tech, Jersey Club, Juke, Afro beat inspired drums, Techno and many more global club soundscapes that encompass her high energy DJ sets. MESSIE\u2019s sets are guaranteed to be bootleg heavy with something for everyone as she draws from her own music taste of rap and grime, to early 2000\u2019s singalongs, girl-boss anthems and queer music culture in the form of edits you\u2019d never expect.\nAlongside her headline tour around Aotearoa in mid 2024, MESSIE has now brought her fresh, high-energy club music internationally to Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, R&V, Beyond The Valley, Wildlands, Love Saves The Day, Gemfest & Outro Festival. With slots at Pohoda Festival, Hidden Festival, Motion, Truck Festival, AIASOUND and All Points East locked in for the second half of 2025, there is no slowing her down.\nMESSIE\nALL NIGHT LONG TOUR Presented by Live Nation\nSTUDIO THE VENUE, AUCKLAND\nSATURDAY, 13 SEPTEMBER\nSAN FRAN, WELLINGTON\nSATURDAY, 20 SEPTEMBER\nTICKETS ON SALE FRIDAY, 4 JULY, 12PM (LOCAL)\nLive Nation Presale: Wednesday 2 July 11:00am - Friday 4 July 11:00am Artist Presale: Wednesday 2 July 11:00am - Friday 4 July 11:00am\nFor complete tour & ticket information, visit: livenation.co.nz"

    "description": "Folk Bitch Trio Debut headline show in Te Whanganui-a-Tara/Wellington\nMelbourne\u2019s alluring Folk Bitch Trio have announced their debut album release tour of New Zealand, playing headline shows in Auckland, Wellington & Christchurch.\n\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories. Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d  As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.  \n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology.\n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

Her approach weaves embodied storytelling, deep listening, and transformative movement.\nAll willing movers are welcome."

The show takes you on a spellbinding journey through three song eras of one of the most famous singers ever. First up: the sound of the 1950s. Louis Brown will capture the audience with the rockabilly sound and signature dance moves of Elvis\u2019 early career. Arron Walker then takes the mic and recreates the role of Elvis in his movie years in the 1960s.  This period incorporates the singer\u2019s famous straight-out-of-the-army look and the black-leather look. Finally, Steve Michaels pays homage to \u2018Aloha from Hawaii\u2019 \u2014 a famous 1973 concert broadcast across Asia and Oceania. All three performers create a magical atmosphere as befits \u2018The King\u2019. \nThe sound, the moves, and the charm of Elvis Presley are lovingly recreated. Go and see it. It\u2019s now or never."

At the heart of Solution focused practice is the belief that change is possible in people\u2019s lives, and change is happening all the time. When a client is asked to notice change it amplifies it makes a difference to the client. It is a great pleasure and honour to walk with clients during this process.\n In the Solution Focused workshop, you will:\n+ Learn the art or be refreshed in the Solution Focused approach\n+ Develop a Solution Focused mindset to ask questions with hope\n+ Draw on the wealth of Bible resources for hope\n+ Apply with particular attention to people living with Grief and Loss, Trauma and Couples (my favourite issues)\n+ Apply questions to help others find confidence, resources and move forward\n+ Focus on solutions rather than the problem/s\n+ Practice the skills needed to apply the Solution Focused approach\n+ Share your strengths and resources in a Solution Focused way\n+ Facilitate a Solution Focused conversation with individuals or groups\n+ Hear some of the latest developments in the Solution Focused world\n+ Have opportunities to ask questions and discuss with others\n Come on a hope-filled journey of change, joy, and possibility. \n1/2 price for students!\n  Bio\nMatt Cameron lives in Timaru, NZ and is a counsellor, Solution Focused trainer, teacher, and tennis referee.

    "description": "Calligratherapy - Beginners\nMany of us live sedentary lifestyles, sitting for up to eight hours or more a day hunched over our keyboard - all the while rarely taking a proper breath! Even if we wanted to take a deep enriching breath into the lower lobes of our lungs, we are limited due to our posture. Often due to the stresses and strains of a busy work and life balance, our unconscious brain can develop a pattern of holding, irregular and shadow breaths.\nDoes this sound like your experience? \nNot being able to breathe properly is the key cause of many chronic respiratory diseases (Nestor, 2020)\nCalligratherapy combines science journalist James Nestor's theory on proper breathing with the philosophy of ancient Chinese calligraphy to promote a state of optimal wellbeing.\nCalligratherapy has been developed specifically for those who have never practiced calligraphy before and who are interested in deriving the benefits without having to learn the language or all the characters. It integrates the simple and intuitive act of inhaling and exhaling into calligraphy practice with Eastern philosophy behind it.\nA range of different breathing exercises are embedded into each 90 minute session focusing on different calligraphy scripts.  Over the five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing, while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts. \nAll materials included in course fee.\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:\nStart a new creative practice in Chinese soft brush calligraphy\nDevelop your own mindfulness strategy\nBetter manage everyday stress levels and access a calm, empowered and positive state of mind\nFind ways to explore eastern philosophy and develop deeper connections with your spiritual self. \nNote:  Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\"."

    "description": "After initially calling it a day in 1999, the Jesus Lizard officially return full time to save us from the current state of musical mediocrity with their latest album, Rack. A blistering resurgence of the so-called \u2018noise rock\u2019 they helped define alongside contemporaries Big Black, Flipper, The Birthday Party, with their previous and most noted albums Head, Goat and Liar. For those of us who live in fear of the reunion album and subsequent tour, the Jesus Lizard thankfully display not only the same chaotic and dark nihilism of their earlier careers but also the maturity and seasoning of a band riding a wave of renewed and reinvigorated form. \n\nOnce slated by famed engineer Steve Albini as \u201cthe greatest band I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019 the Jesus Lizard not only lived up to this lofty praise in their prime but continue to do so in their advancing years. David Yow still leads the charge as the maniacally possessed frontman entering crowds with reckless abandon and a stamina that much younger vocalists would kill for. The original rhythm section of David Wm Sims and Mac McNeilly further continue to prove why they were and are the best bass & drum combo since Jones and Bonham, anchoring the ship as Captain Yow and first mate Denison navigate the wild seas of their songs. And while he may not always feature (as he rightly should) on many modern music journalists \u2018best guitarists lists\u2019, Duane Denison could perhaps be the most innovative and idiosyncratic punk rock guitarist EVER. However, each member is a sum of their parts but combined they are as Albini also once said \u201cthe purest melding of the sublime and profane.\u201d\n\nWhether you are a longtime disciple of the Jesus Lizard, seeing them when last here in \u201898, or perhaps your fandom is more recent and have only seen videos of their legendary live performances, you will know that these shows are not to be missed.  \n\nSaturday 11th October 2025 - The Tuning Fork, Auckland (All ages)\nSunday 12th October 2025 - San Fran, Wellington (R18 unless accompanied by your legal guardian)\n\nBio\n\nIn the jade-cultivating climes of online rock journalism, the angle of \u201cband has new album,\u201d  is about as interesting as watching Instagram reels of your brother-in-law\u2019s recent  bathroom remodel. But when a band decides to follow up their last album from over 26 years ago? That\u2019s high on testicular fortitude and as dumb as fidget spinners. Yet, when  that band is the Jesus Lizard, everything in your pathetic cultural dystopia suddenly falls  away and the air smells like Heaven\u2026 Their seventh studio album, Rack, produced by \nPaul Allen, and slated for release on September 13 via Ipecac Recordings, features 11  tracks of brisk guitar rock you haven\u2019t heard since\u2026 the last time the Jesus Lizard took  over a stage in your town. The Jesus Lizard \u2014 vocalist David Yow, guitarist Duane \nDenison, bassist David Wm. Sims, and drummer Mac McNeilly \u2014 have returned with a  record teeming with the kind of madness needed to beat down today\u2019s AOR mediocrity and piss-perfect pop drivel alike. \n\nSince their inception in Chicago in 1987, the Jesus Lizard has thrilled audiences all over  the planet. The impeccable rocket-thrust rhythm section of Sims and McNeilly was the  perfect launchpad for Denison\u2019s jagged yet clean-toned riffing and Yow\u2019s mercurial \nvocalizations manifesting as everything from panicked citizen, reality escapee or  wounded sea mammal. The Jesus Lizard\u2019s fury carried on through six studio albums,  two live recordings and a brace of singles and EPs. \n\nOn Rack, the Jesus Lizard have returned reconstituted, refreshed and positively  revving. No tepid, bland tracks to show how they\u2019ve \u201cmatured\u201d as songwriters. No inane  detours into unnecessary genre exercises. And definitely no weird moves into \nexperimental realms that come off just as contrived and calculated as the top of the  Billboard Charts. The opening salvo \u201cHide & Seek\u201d finds Yow singing/sprechstimming  his way with remarkable clarity as his bandmates shore him up with their patented \nacceleration. The noir vibes coming off of \u201cWhat If?\u201d is a startling direction for the band,  with Yow narrating the action, like he was looking at a random person in an airport  lounge and concocting an elaborate backstory about them. The sinister \u201cAlexis Feels \nSick\u201d is inspired by Girls Against Boys/Soulside drummer Alexis Fleisig\u2019s guarded  opinion of modern life that turns into a treatise of man\u2019s inhumanity to man. \u201cMoto(R)\u201d is  playing out of the coolest car tailgating in the parking lot at one of those horrific radio\nrock fests. And while we\u2019re on the subject of forcing cool into uncool, \u201cFalling Down\u201d  reminds all of us in slightly under three-and-a-half minutes how marvelously badassed  the Jesus Lizard have always been, making our fists ball-up so tightly they look like the ends of chicken bones. \n\nThe Jesus Lizard. They might not be young, but they will never, ever get fucking old.\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

Fans can register for access at livenation.co.nz. \n\nThe name \u2018Freak Slug\u2019 encapsulates Xenya\u2019s artistic world perversely and perfectly. Known for following the beat of her own drum, Xenya\u2019s releases under the name Freak Slug so far include debut 2020 EP Videos and its viral hit Radio (23 million streams and counting), and follow-up EPs I\u2019m In Love (2022) and Viva La Vulva (2023). Having shown listeners her more \u201csummery, happy sound\u201d, she then delivered a more grungy-feel with debut album I Blow Out Big Candles, furthermore pushing the diversity of her sound. \n\nHugely influenced by \u201890s cult heroes including Ride, Mazzy Star and Stephen Malkmus, Freak Slug is all about hitting a mood. Everything that fuels her creative output is raw, authentic, sometimes weird, but always totally true self-expression. I Blow Out Big Candles is a strong statement of all of this and more. Down there, picking through the curious mix of sounds and feelings, from nostalgic, \u201890s-influenced and dreamy as well as eccentric and experimental, lives Freak Slug. The 10-track project gives listeners a taste of what they will be in for at her Aotearoa shows, a journey of both soft soulfulness and sonic songwriting, all laid out on the table. \n\nI Blow Out Big Candles is as fearless a record as Xenya herself and was met with features and reviews throughout some of the most prestigious radio and media platforms in the United Kingdom. With her 4 piece band, Freak Slug has performed at SXSW Austin \u2013 and was the most searched UK artist at the 2025 edition - alongside many other showcases and festivals. Earlier this year Freak Slug completed her Big Candles tour of the US, CA, UK and EU taking in 40 cities including sold out dates in LA, Chicago, Seattle, London, Paris and Amsterdam, she also has a busy summer of festivals festival with a headline slot on the alcove stage at Latitude."

Wellington has scored six major opportunities to see the BLACKCAPS and WHITE FERNS in action. Four formidable opponents are travelling to New Zealand shores. Australia, England, West Indies, and South Africa will compete across multiple formats. The live T20I action at Sky Stadium and Test matches at Cello Basin Reserve will have Wellington buzzing.\nThe 2024-25 season saw bumper crowds, so NZC are hoping to build on this exciting momentum.

He showed how this energy can be absorbed freely into the body, and through his teaching many people were cured back then as today, even from diseases that are considered incurable.\nNumerous medically documented success reports demonstrate the current effects of his teaching.

His YouTube content and podcasts cemented his comedic credentials. He\u2019s since turned his hand to live shows. Now, following a successful tour of the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe, Luke is coming to Wellington. His brand-new show, Good Intentions, is set to make The Opera House giggle.   \nLuke is known for his viral crowd-work interactions. These often lead to unusual, yet hilarious encounters. Despite not having much control over his impulsive thoughts, the Australian insists that deep down he means well. This year, he\u2019s on a mission to prove that he really does have good intentions. \nIn 2016, Luke went viral with his \u2018You don\u2019t own me\u2019 videos. In these, he humorously disobeyed societal norms. His comedy fame has earned him over 600k followers on Instagram. He is also the host of the autobiographical podcast \u2018Memoirs of a White Guy\u2019. "

Now sixteen years into an extraordinary career, it seems our heroine has fully accepted her mantle as one of the world\u2019s great rock stars, fronting her gothic-tinged new outfit to widespread awe and acclaim, Devra Hoff on bass guitar and backing vocals, Teeny Lieberson on keys, guitar, and backing vocals, and Jorge Balbi on drums.\n\n\u201cThe Attachment Theory are a tight unit, woven together by Devra Hoff\u2019s inventive, intelligent bass lines... this show was less about [Sharon\u2019s] past and more about her future, which appears to lie with The Attachment Theory - a band who, on this evidence, are bringing the very best out of her.\u201d \u2013 Manchester Evening News\n\nAlso performing at The Others Way, and playing support in Wellington and Christchurch, American songwriter Shannon Lay is much of a punk as she is a folk singer, citing both The Ramones and Nick Drake as influences. As a member of garage rocker Ty Segall\u2019s Freedom Band, Lay can certainly make a racket, but for these shows, she will be opening as a solo act. The Guardian were quick to assure us that \u201cThis is no mere indie-folk musician,\u201d and Pitchfork said her most recent studio album \u201cpresents a quiet, lovely, undramatic rendering of the dramatic\u201d.\n\nWe truly could not be more excited to be welcoming Queen Shazza back to Aotearoa for these shows, and with the addition of both her band The Attachment Theory and Shannon Lay\u2019s opening spot, you should be dang well excited too!\n\n\u201cSharon Van Etten and The Attachment Theory\u2019s self-titled record is an early Album of the Year contender\u201d - www.independent.co.uk"

Originally hailing from the West Region of Ireland, the group\u2014Robbie Cunningham (lead vocals/guitar), Ross McNerney (mandolin/bouzouki), and Oisin McCaffrey (vocals/guitar)\u2014have unassumingly gone from quitting their day jobs in rural Ireland to the doorstep of an international breakthrough, buoyed by over 100 million streams and sold-out shows around the world.\nAmble\u2019s debut album, Reverie, set for release on Friday, 23 May this year, showcases Amble's signature sound: relatability, intimate storytelling, and authenticity seamlessly blended with no-frills acoustic instrumentation, serene soundscapes, and heavenly natural harmonies.
