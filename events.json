    "long_description": "The impact of colonisation and urban drift are themes in a theatrical reboot at the next Aotearoa New Zealand Festival of the Arts. \u2018Waiora Te \u016akaip\u014d \u2014 The Homeland\u2019 was originally commissioned by the festival in 1992. Its return 34 years later at the 2026 festival is highly anticipated. It has become a landmark piece of New Zealand theatre \u2014 exploring the tension between past and future. Set in the summer of 1965, the play follows Hone, who brings his family from New Zealand\u2019s East Cape to the South Island in search of a better life. As they gather for a beachside birthday h\u0101ng\u012b with their P\u0101keh\u0101 guests, buried secrets and cultural tensions rise to the surface. Far from their  t\u012bpuna , the family must navigate questions of identity, belonging, and survival. \nWaiora Te \u016akaip\u014d was conceived, written and directed by Hone Kouka (Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101ti Raukawa, Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu). The multi-award-winning writer/director has penned 13 plays. Many have been staged in Aotearoa and further afield in Canada, South Africa, New Caledonia, and the UK. Waiora Te \u016akaip\u014d is presented in partnership with the Aotearoa New Zealand Festival of the Arts, Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, Auckland Theatre Company and Tawata Productions.",

    "long_description": "It\u2019s Westerberg High, where popularity is a matter of life and death. Welcome to \u2018Heathers the Musical\u201d. Based on a movie with the same name, the show is a coming-of-age story dealing with love, heartache, defying expectations, and being true to yourself. It originally premiered in Los Angeles in 2013. Since then, the musical has had record-breaking seasons across the globe. It now makes its professional New Zealand debut in 2026, and Wellington is in line to join the school assembly. Described as a high-octane, black comedy rock musical, Heathers is packed with a mix of ballads and showstoppers. The catchy tunes are written by Kevin Murphy (Desperate Housewives) and Laurence O\u2019Keefe (Legally Blonde: The Musical). \nThe 1989 film starred Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. It quickly achieved cult status among audiences. Both the movie and musical follow high school student Veronica Sawyer. Veronica is just another nobody until she\u2019s unexpectedly taken under the wings of the beautiful and cruel Heathers. When mysterious teen rebel J.D. arrives, Veronica learns that it might kill to be a nobody, but it's murder being a somebody. \nThis special production will feature a stellar Australasian cast. So grab your scrunchies, break out the Corn Nuts and wait for the bell to ring.",

The damp, cobbled pavement glistens as the lights of street lanterns dance across the slick stones. The night chills the bones and shivers the soul of anyone outside.\n\nYet inside these tavern walls the food is hearty, and the ale is warm and frothy. A fire blazes in the hearth, and the tavern is alive with the voices and laughter.\n\nSuddenly, the tavern door swings open, and you all notice it at the same time. Framed by the lamp-lit fog, a form strides through the doorway. His brightly coloured clothes are draped in loose folds about him, and his hat hangs askew, hiding his eyes in shadows. Without hesitation, he walks up to your table and pulls from his tunic a sealed letter, addressed to all of you in beautiful flowing script. He drops the letter on the table and turns and leaves the tavern, vanishing into the fog.\n\n\u2018Curse of Strahd\u2019 is a D&D5E gothic horror campaign. It has everything you and your party needs to have a grand experience. It will take you to the mysterious village of Barovia, a realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by a wizard, the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, the master of Castle Ravenloft. \u2018Curse of Strahd\u2019 is a rich narrative story you are part of as it\u2019s unfolding. It\u2019s not just about fighting monsters and hunting for treasure in dungeons; there is a compelling story arc and a richly realized antagonist.\n\n",

Now venue name, in co-operation with Te Papa, is set to reveal some of the fascinating science and wonderful secrets of one of New Zealand\u2019s most significant natural history specimens.\n\nTe Papa's Head of Natural History, Phil Edgar, said, \u201cIn learning about this weird and mysterious creature, we hope visitors will have a greater appreciation for life in the deep sea, much of which remains undiscovered.\u201d\n\nThe Colossal Squid is one of the most iconic specimens at Te Papa, and while touring the complete specimen is impossible, some of the important parts of the squid have found their way to Cobblestones.\nTe Papa\u2019s Curator of Invertebrates, Dr Rodrigo Salvador, explains how important the Colossal Squid has been for the science community, and how popular it has been among the public.\n\n\u201cTe Papa\u2019s Colossal Squid has been a major source of information for scientists and the museum\u2019s most popular exhibit since its debut. They live in the deep Antarctic waters, and despite being one of the largest invertebrate species in existence, they are very rarely captured\u201d.\n\nColossal Squid Ngu Tipua centres around an interactive table displaying many different objects, including the lens from an eye of the Colossal Squid, part of a tentacle, and a complete tiny squid, a miniature of its colossal relative. Touchable rotating models of a squid\u2019s tentacle hook and the Colossal Squid's beak are also on display.\n\nThe exhibition also displays two documentaries which show life in the depths of the Southern Ocean, and how the most complete Colossal Squid ever found ended up at Te Papa.\n\nThe public can continue the experience and learn beyond the exhibition with a new Te Papa press book for children, Whiti: Colossal Squid of the Deep, and online Te Papa resources, including a free downloadable Colossal Squid Activity Book.\n\n\u201cThanks to the support of WBS and Te Papa, Cobblestones is delighted to be bringing this fascinating exhibition to Wairarapa during the summer holidays. It\u2019s a must-see exhibition for the young and young at heart to learn about this fascinating creature, its world, and habitat.\u201d\n\nColossal Squid Ngu Tipua is developed and toured by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\nCobblestones Museum - 063049687 or cobblestonesmuseumgreytown@gmail.com",

Scenes from the lives of Jesus and Moses, painted by Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli, provide additional historical background and allow for a deeper insight into this epoch.\n\nEnhancing the exhibition further, VIP guided tours will be led by Dr Christopher Longhurst, a theologian and aesthete who served for 17 years as an operatore didattico at the Sistine Chapel, St Peter\u2019s Basilica, and the Vatican Museums' Papal Art Galleries.\n\n* Booking and credit card fees apply",

The upcoming world tour will mark Shai Hulud\u2019s first extended run of shows in over a decade, featuring van der Velde on vocals.\n\nThe Furnace Fest performance was a monumental moment in the band\u2019s history, bringing together, for the first time since 2004, the full lineup that recorded the landmark 2003 album That Within Blood Ill-Tempered. For many fans, it was the first chance to see van der Velde back on the mic, and he did not disappoint. If anything, his vocals have grown stronger and even more ferocious with time, while the chemistry on stage was undeniable, a testament to the band\u2019s enduring spirit and technical mastery. Fans and newcomers alike were left buzzing about the energy, emotion, and sheer force of the performance.\n\nWhile the upcoming world tour will feature Shai Huluds current lineup, van der Velde will helm vocal duties for all shows, delivering performances that span the band\u2019s celebrated catalog, including a spotlight on tracks from That Within Blood Ill-Tempered.\n\nShai Hulud is back. Stronger. Louder. And more pissed off than ever before and happy to return to Aotearoa after twenty years\n\n",

The upcoming world tour will mark Shai Hulud\u2019s first extended run of shows in over a decade, featuring van der Velde on vocals.\nThe Furnace Fest performance was a monumental moment in the band\u2019s history, bringing together, for the first time since 2004, the full lineup that recorded the landmark 2003 album That Within Blood Ill-Tempered. For many fans, it was the first chance to see van der Velde back on the mic, and he did not disappoint. If anything, his vocals have grown stronger and even more ferocious with time, while the chemistry on stage was undeniable, a testament to the band\u2019s enduring spirit and technical mastery. Fans and newcomers alike were left buzzing about the energy, emotion, and sheer force of the performance.\nWhile the upcoming world tour will feature Shai Huluds current lineup, van der Velde will helm vocal duties for all shows, delivering performances that span the band\u2019s celebrated catalog, including a spotlight on tracks from That Within Blood Ill-Tempered.\nShai Hulud is back. Stronger. Louder. And more pissed off than ever before and happy to return to Aotearoa after twenty years",

    "long_description": "Wow, you're in for a treat with this showcase concert featuring two great singer songwriters who meld perfectly!\n\nJackie Bristow was brought up in Gore, honed her craft in the pubs and clubs of Sydney, Australia and now lives in Nashville Tennessee, USA. Jackie has released five critically acclaimed studio albums and spent the last few years opening for Chris Isaak, Boz Skaggs, Bonnie Rait and Tommy Emmanuel, as well as headlining her own shows.\n\nJoined by Barry Saunders, A genuine Kiwi music hero, and singer and principal songwriter for the legendary country band The Warratahs. Barry has also had a parallel solo career spanning six albums, along with collaborations with Sam Hunt and Delaney Davidson.\n\nJackie's life was turned around in 2020 whilst visiting New Zealand, when the Covid-19 lockdown hit. Unable to return to her home in Nashville, she \u201cmade the best of the crazy world\u201d of that time by focusing her creative energy in new directions. A silver lining saw Jackie connecting with Barry Saunders and an amazing friendship and music partnership was made. Jackie and Barry went on to perform shows around New Zealand and releasing their debut single collaboration Good Miles to Go in 2024.\n\n\"We're two seasoned songwriters who have teamed up as we love singing together and our voices and songs work so well together\n\n\"We combine our catalogues of songs. We perform as a duo, with two acoustic guitars and two voices, harmonies, harp, including some solo performances and stories\".",

When we connect to the rivers that flow within, we are reminded of our divinity: we are nature and we can find liberation in our sense of belonging as a part of the whole.\n\nThis is a space to FLOW FREELY, FEEL FULLY and anchor in any new year intentions as we transition from the year of the snake to the year of the fire horse.\n\nWe\u2019ll begin our ritual with ceremonial cacao and a grounding meditation, then drop into a guided movement journey with live soundscape. There are no steps to learn, no performance\u2014just presence, curiosity, and letting your body move as it feels. Barefoot and phone-free, you\u2019re invited to drop deep into free-form movement, awakening the divine currents that flow through you.\n\nCome as you are.\nMove with what you feel.\nLeave feeling empowered, connected, and alive\n\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52

Live vicariously with Insecure Delusion: A Tribute To Tool!\n\nAfter a SOLD OUT Wellington show in early 2025 Insecure Delusion are back in the capital at the famous San Fran to give Tool fans a fix with their tribute to the greats - whether you missed out on the real deal or just want to get out amongst Tool fans again for a night of the best rock songs around - Insecure Delusion are ready to deliver this January 2026!\n\nRocking out from 9:00pm on Friday the 16th of January, enjoy the tunes that gave Tool a cult-like status amongst devoted fans. Playing fan favourites like The Pot, Stinkfist, Forty Six & 2 and others, it\u2019s the perfect way to get your Tool fix whether you saw them in Auckland or didn't get the chance! It might seem crazy to run a tribute to the greats a couple of months after the legends themselves are here but these lads are a bit mad and they bring that energy to every show!\n\nInsecure Delusion: A Tribute To Tool take the stage with energy and passion for the genres and the musicianship that Tool is known for. An event not to be missed if you're a Tool fiend.\n\nAnd just to make the night extra special, our friends from Down With The System will be opening with a killer set from the legends that are SOAD!\n\nEarlybirds are available now but only for a limited ticket run! At only $25 per ticket (+ bf), your bank account will be thanking you. \ud83e\udd18\n\n\"I\u2019ve had the chance to see this band twice in Napier. They\u2019re absolutely in keeping with Tool, powerful vocals, a fantastic drummer, and an all-round tight, talented group of guys. Great energy, great music, and genuinely good people.\" Rion R\n\n\"I was completely blown away by the tightness and musicality of these guys. All showcased amazing versatility on their chosen instruments. Would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates quality music. Thanks for an entertaining evening. Smashed it out of the park! \" Micheal D\n\n\nPlease note: San Fran has a Supervised Licence meaning under 18s are welcome as long as they are supervised by a responsible adult (usually mum or dad).\n\n",

You\u2019ll learn how to focus at infinity, choose the best camera settings, build compositions under the Milky Way, and work with RAW files, noise control and exposure strategy. You\u2019ll photograph live star fields and leave with images you can genuinely be proud of.\n\nNo astronomy expertise or prior astrophotography experience is required \u2014 just your curiosity. Bring a camera and tripod if you have them, but if not, you can still attend, learn from telescope-linked imaging feeds, and gain the skills and confidence to shoot the cosmos on your own.\n\nHeld at Star Safari, right in the Wairarapa dark-sky heartlands, this experience takes place under the same southern skies recognised by Lonely Planet as one of the world\u2019s top stargazing destinations. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to try astrophotography, this is the moment, and this is the place.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll gain:\n- Confidence to shoot the night sky\n- Proven camera settings and workflow\n- Real photos of the Milky Way and southern star fields\n- Knowledge you can use anywhere the southern sky is visible\n- A rare, premium learning experience under a world-class sky\n\nPerfect for couples, travellers, creatives, astronomy lovers, and anyone who wants a deeper connection to the night.\n\nSpaces are limited to keep the experience personal.",

When we connect to the rivers that flow within, we are reminded of our divinity: we are nature and we can find liberation in our sense of belonging as a part of the whole.\nThis is a space to FLOW FREELY, FEEL FULLY and anchor in any new year intentions as we transition from the year of the snake to the year of the fire horse.\nWe\u2019ll begin our ritual with ceremonial cacao and a grounding meditation, then drop into a guided movement journey with live soundscape. There are no steps to learn, no performance\u2014just presence, curiosity, and letting your body move as it feels. Barefoot and phone-free, you\u2019re invited to drop deep into free-form movement, awakening the divine currents that flow through you.\nCome as you are.\nMove with what you feel.\nLeave feeling empowered, connected, and alive.\nSomatic dance is a guided movement practice that helps you tune into your body\u2019s wisdom and move from the inside out. Unlike ecstatic dance, which is typically an open, DJ-led space with no facilitation, somatic dance offers gentle guidance to support you in exploring sensation, emotion, and embodiment in a safe, intentional way. You\u2019re not learning steps or performing\u2014you're being invited into presence, curiosity, and feeling. With a focus on nervous system regulation, personal expression, and inner listening, somatic dance creates a nurturing space to come home to yourself.\nYour Hosts...\nJenna Joan | Embodiment Facilitator\nJenna Joan is a somatic family constellation therapist, yoga teacher, and group facilitator who has been leading movement spaces for over 15 years. With a background in yoga, somatic dance, and therapeutic embodiment, her work blends play, authenticity, ancestral healing, and deep nervous system awareness. Jenna is also a cacao alchemist and ceremonial facilitator, known for creating safe, soulful spaces that invite freedom, connection, and inner exploration. She has been hosting workshops, retreats, and community events for nearly a decade, and also works 1:1 in more therapeutic settings.\nSonic Sutra | Somatic Dance DJ\nSonic Sutra is a sound artist and somatic dance DJ who creates immersive musical journeys designed to support authentic movement, emotional release, and deep embodiment. With a focus on somatic dance and therapeutic soundscapes, their sets are intentionally curated to guide dancers through an inner experience\u2014honouring the body\u2019s natural rhythms and the intelligence within. Their offerings create safe, accessible spaces for people of all bodies, backgrounds, and experience levels to explore movement, presence, and connection. Rooted in play, precision, and deep listening, Sonic Sutra brings music that moves beyond entertainment\u2014into healing and transformation.",

The beginning of the year is a perfect time to get together and feel the power of community and connection through singing.\n\nSing for renewal and hope. Sing for harmony, joy, and inspiration. Sing for healing. Sing to regain your strength and empower others.\n\nSpend the 2 days encircled by a community of like-minded people and focusing on your well-being through singing. Rest, connect, and restore. The weekend is carefully planned so there is plenty of time to sing and to rest in between.\n\nWe will breathe together, listen, create beautiful sounds, let go of our worries, and lift each other to a sense of fulfilment and joy. And to make the event even more special, Lala will be cooking an authentic Malagasy dinner on Saturday night (an experience not to be missed).\n\nJonathan Berkahn and Lala Simpson have led workshops and performed together for many years. They are both highly skilled song leaders who lead from the heart and joyfully share their gifts. You will be in safe hands. ALL SINGERS OF ALL LEVELS OF ABILITY ARE WELCOME!!!\n\nJonathan will teach a mix of pop, folk and original songs, and Lala will teach a mix of songs from South Africa, Georgia, Madagascar and community songs.\n\nIf you are coming from out of town, the Home of Compassion offers some accommodation with reasonable rates which includes breakfast. Please contact them directly to enquire at\n\nREGISTRATION: Get tickets on Humanitix, or if you want to avoid the extra fees, register here\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nSaturday, 17th of January: This first part of the retreat will be held at the Island Bay Presbyterian Church. We will spend the day singing in the beautiful auditorium and share a Malagasy meal cooked by Lala at the end of the day. Morning tea, afternoon tea, and dinner provided. Please BYO lunch.

The last one we had at Battle Hill was so nice and we met so many new people. Noting that this is weather dependent.\n\nWhere:\nWe have secured \"The Dell\" area for semi-exclusive use at Battle Hill. (It will be Wellington Anniversary weekend so may be a bit busy.) This means a large section of grass with trees, toilets and the river close by for the kids to play in and see the eels and we can braai in webers, etc. The bigger kids that want to go and swim in the hole can take a walk there. Unfortunately, there are no concrete slabs that we can make fires on so you will need to bring a braai with.\n\nWhat to bring?\nWell, this is not a catered place so you will need to bring the following:\nGazebo\nChairs and/or blankets\nBraai and charcoal/wood i.e. weber, etc \ud83d\ude09\nThere are gas braais as well but you will need to share it with the rest of the people / campers.)\nMeat, drinks, salad and water/ drinks (to drink and to K*ll your fire with)\nBalls, bats, etc for the kids to play (If someone is keen on arranging games for the day, we would appreciate it!)\n\nThere is no cost to us getting semi exclusive use of the area. However, if you want to extend the night and camp, you will need to pay for that.\n\nPlease note that this is a working farm area and unfortunately no dogs are allowed AT ALL.\n\nAlso note that the gates are locked at 8pm so if you are not camping, please keep this in mind so you can get out in time.\n\nThis is an open invitation so no need to RSVP to me but it would be nice to have an indication on how many people will attend by confirming on the event \"Going\" or \"Interested\".\n\nI hope to see LOTS of you there!\n\n",

    "long_description": "What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

From there, you\u2019ll be shown how to solder your rings together with a jeweller\u2019s torch before finishing them with filing, sanding and polishing techniques. Along the way, our tutors will share tips and tricks, patiently guiding you so you feel confident every step of the way.\n\nBy the end of the session, you\u2019ll have crafted two sterling silver rings and two copper or brass rings, and if time allows, you can make even more!\n\nEach ring you make is completely your own, whether you keep them sleek and simple or experiment with texture and pattern. You\u2019ll leave not only with a stylish, wearable ring stack, but also with the joy of having made something truly unique with your own hands.\n\nThis class is perfect for beginners, groups of friends, or visitors wanting a memorable creative experience. Many students find jewellery making a wonderfully mindful activity - slowing down, working with their hands and enjoying the calming rhythm of making.\n\nYour class fee includes copper and brass for practice, sterling silver for two rings, plus all consumables such as solder, sandpaper and polishing materials. Extra silver and other metals are available for purchase in the studio if you\u2019d like to expand your collection.\n\nChildren aged 12 and up are welcome, though anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.",

Combining angular guitars with dream-pop sensibilities, the band pushes the storied history of the Dunedin Sound - made famous by Flying Nun - into new and uncharted territory.\n\nFormed in 2017 by longtime friends Semisi Ma\u2019ia\u2019i (vocals & guitar), Oscar Johns (bass), Hamish Morgan (drums) and De Stevens (guitar), the band found unexpected success with their debut album Lizard Tears (2017), which garnered international acclaim, including from COMPLEX, who called it an \u201cexciting, intoxicating debut.\u201d\n\nSubsequent releases like Talk On/Commic (2018) and Quotidian (2020) showcased their evolution into sharper, more angular guitars and angst-driven melodies, earning praise from CLASH, NME and BrooklynVegan.\n\nMarlin's Dreaming\u2019s latest release, HIRL (2024), arrived to critical acclaim from Atwood Magazine, Rolling Stone and Americana UK, and saw the band play a string of sold-out shows across New Zealand and Australia at the end of the year.\n\nThey have toured with Parquet Courts, The Chills, Kirin J Callinan and Dope Lemon, and are currently hunkering down, writing new material.\n\nHaving played sold-out tours across Australia and New Zealand, Marlin's Dreaming continues to push musical boundaries, heightening guitar pop to a fine art.",

Tradition meets vocal art, experimentation and storytelling in a personal and intimate way. Audiences everywhere connect to the honesty of an unaccompanied voice, no matter the language.\n\nAlongside her solo work, F\u00e4lt collaborates in performing arts and multidisciplinary projects, and is an active teacher and lecturer. She holds three music degrees and has studied folk music in five countries, but her central focus remains developing the art of solo a cappella performance. She has collaborated with several Aotearoa artists over the years, including film composer Karl S\u00f6lve Steven and taonga puoro player Rob Thorne.\n\nF\u00e4lt now returns to Aotearoa for her third tour, bringing her powerful voice and Nordic stories back to local audiences.\n\nKoha entry.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Anna F\u00e4lt is a versatile voice artist, composer and singing teacher with a deep passion for Nordic folk singing. She has toured widely across the Nordic region and beyond with her distinctive solo vocal concerts. Drawing on singing traditions from her two home countries, Finland and Sweden, she blends bright Scandinavian clarity with darker Eastern European colours, performing in churches, museums, festivals, clubs and concert halls.\n\nHer concerts celebrate the power of the human voice: a one-woman band creating sound worlds you may have never heard before. Tradition meets vocal art, experimentation and storytelling in a personal and intimate way. Audiences everywhere connect to the honesty of an unaccompanied voice, no matter the language.\n\nAlongside her solo work, F\u00e4lt collaborates in performing arts and multidisciplinary projects and is an active teacher and lecturer. She holds three music degrees and has studied folk music in five countries, but her central focus remains developing the art of solo a cappella performance. She has collaborated with several Aotearoa artists over the years, including film composer Karl S\u00f6lve Steven and taonga puoro player Rob Thorne.\n\nF\u00e4lt now returns to Aotearoa for her third tour, bringing her powerful voice and Nordic stories back to local audiences.\n\nKoha entry.",

Born and raised in Poowong (Victoria), Wilson was surrounded by music from an early age. At just 2 years old he started playing the drums along to his mother\u2019s music collection consisting of old soul, funk and r&b from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. He started learning the guitar as soon as he could, and had the habit of making anything he could get his hands on into an instrument. Growing up far from the city instilled a strong sense of curiosity and work ethic in him from a young age, leading him to produce his first batch of demos in his teenage years. A stand-out among these demos was the song \u2018Home\u2019. \u2018Home\u2019 found its way to Sam Teskey (The Teskey Brothers) who would go on to co-produce the song alongside Wilson when he was just 18.\n\nFollowing the release of \u2018Home\u2019, he went on to sell out The Gasometer and play a string of festival slots alongside a variety of artists including The Teskey Brothers and Boy and Bear. At this time, Wilson moved to St Kilda and in the heart of Melbourne began collaborating with Sensible J (Sampa The Great, Remi, Immy Owusu) on his debut EP \u2018Material Plane P1\u2019 which was released to critical acclaim in August 2022. After that, he co-produced Oscar LaDell\u2019s EP \u2018No Blue\u2019 and subsequently embarked on a co-headline tour of Aotearoa and Australia with LaDell. After a three year break from releasing music, Wilson Blackley returns to Aotearoa alongside Oscar LaDell and King Leo this summer to celebrate the release of his new song 'Remain'",

We are a small school with a true family and community ethos. We believe that children deserve an individual education that prepares them for life. We value life skills, emotional intelligence and academic skills.\n====\n\nAt Porirua Montessori Primary School we believe in a different kind of learning \u2013 one where every child is truly seen, valued and empowered.\n\ud83d\udc63 Instead of embedding children into age-only class groups, we use mixed\u2010age classrooms so younger tamariki learn from older peers and older children grow in leadership and empathy.\n\n\n\ud83c\udfaf We focus on independence and choice. Our students plan parts of their day, select work that meets their interests and pace, and deepen concentration in long, uninterrupted work sessions.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Our curriculum is grounded in \u201cEducation for Life\u201d \u2013 we integrate academic learning with care for each child, community, culture and the environment. Respect, responsibility and compassion are woven through everything.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcda We go beyond the expected. With small class sizes and a learning environment designed especially for students aged 5-13, we tailor programmes to each child\u2019s strengths and needs rather than expecting every child to move at the same pace.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something beyond the usual primary school experience \u2013 a place where your child can grow not just academically but as a confident, capable, connected human \u2013 get in touch with us today to learn more about 2026\n\nRSVP -\nenrolments. https://poriruamontessori.squarespace.com/\n\n",

    "long_description": "Neurodiversity seems to be a hot topic of discussion lately. Famous singers such as Lewis Capaldi and Sia and actors such as Ryan Gosling and Channing Tatum have discussed their neurodiverse conditions. Lockdowns and social media have driven many adults to have startling realisations about their own neurodiverse conditions. It seems suddenly \u2013 all at once \u2013 the world has become aware that 15-20% of people have different types of brains. (Free for NZ citizens/residents, all others pay $99).\n\nDescription\nThis one-day workshop introduces you to the topic of neurodiversity and considers some of the key conditions that people live with. We look at:\n\n-ADHD \u2013 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n-Autism\n-The \u201cDys family\u201d \u2013 dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia (Developmental Coordination Disorder)\n-OCD \u2013 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\n-Tourette\u2019s Syndrome\n\nTikTok creator and public speaker on neurodiversity, Nigel Sutton, will introduce the subject and help you discover the definitions and impacts of each of the key kinds of neurodiversity. Working together with other participants, you will consider many key commonalities that those living with various neurodivergent conditions experience. We will expose the realities of being neurodivergent in a \u201cneurotypical world\u201d, and this will allow you to develop empathy and practical strategies to support neurodivergent people to be their best.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s leading dyslexia expert, Mike Styles, will provide an interactive and participatory session to assist you in understanding and supporting a family member or friend who has dyslexia or a similar learning difference.\n\nYou will be able to ask anything you want with our neurodivergent hot seat session.\n\nFind out from those offering \u201clived experience\u201d what it is really like to have a different kind of brain. This one-day workshop is: \u201dNeurodiversity in a Nutshell\u201d \u2013 whether you know a little or a lot, whether you are a relative, employer, partner, friend, or just interested to know more about neurodiversity \u2013 this workshop is for you!\n\n[You must be a NZ citizen or resident to register in this course for free, and you must provide photo ID when you attend.

With releases from some of the biggest names in the game, AlpaKa MuziK has been paving the way for this fast emerging genre with relentless quality music and has become one of the most prominent labels in the psychedelic techno sub-genre.\n\nWith over 125 releases and over 650 tracks under their belt, AlpaKa has quickly become a powerhouse label in the underground techno community.\n\nSince early 2022, in a little over 2 years, KOZY has gone on 9 international tours, including 5 euro tours, Australia, South Africa Mauritius, India, Mexico and has played over 150 gigs in 24 months in over 30 countries and counting.\n\nSome prominent festivals he has performed at include, Esoteric in Australia, Hadra in France, Texas Eclipse, Boom Festival and many others, bringing to many of them the AlpaKa MuziK takeovers that showcase the cutting edge psychedelic techno sound through countless live sets around the world.\n\nHe recently finished his 4-month long 2025 summer euro tour where he performed at Boom Festival in Portugal and many more AlpaKa Showcases all around Europe and beyond. His 2025-2026 world tour is in motion, with Japan and a large Southern Hemisphere schedule in the works. With an unstoppable arsenal of unreleased, cutting edge bangers, he'll leave you wanting more after every set.\n\nAZTORIA ( AU)\n\nAztoria is the psytech project of Ashley Zadel, also known as Flow Theory.\n\nFor more than 16 years, his melodic bush techno sound has evolved through auditory storytelling on stages across the globe, from Cape Town to London, Israel to Brazil, Portugal, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nRooted in progressive soundscapes with an organic flavour, Aztoria blends melodic deep house grooves with minimal techno to craft psychedelic atmospheres that ignite the imagination.\n\nAztoria burst onto the scene with his debut EP Reborn (Dense Nebula Records), hitting #4 on Beatport\u2019s Techno charts. His 2024 single Birds of Paradise (Soliq Records) soared to #33, while his Inner Groove remix landed at #23 in Progressive House (Techgnosis Records). With fresh releases on Techgnosis, Recovery Collective and Puzzles Records and more in the works, Aztoria is carving his path in the underground with relentless energy and innovation.\n\nWhether in the depths of a forest or the heart of a concrete jungle, Aztoria\u2019s tunes will captivate and elevate you with his storytelling magic.\n\n\nMusic Links:\n\nKOZY:\n\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/kozy_alpaka\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/KozyAlpaKa\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kozy_alpaka/\n\nAlpaKa MuziK:\nLinktree: http://alpakamuzik.com/\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/alpakamuzik\nBeatport: https://www.beatport.com/label/alpaka-muzik/80811\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6EsSTQhe0uLiZuACEccK9w?si=2e2088e283414cc0\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXZKtpUzqv6-R1AKYIexDAA\nBandcamp: https://alpakamuzik.bandcamp.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlpaKaMuziK\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alpaka_muzik/\n\n\nAZTORIA MUSIC\n\n\nAztoria Latest Music Releases:\n\nBIRDS OF PARADISE - REMIXED EP - AZTORIA\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/birdsofparadiseremixed\n\nMYSTIC JESTER - AZTORIA & NOSTAVALGIA\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/mysticjester\n\nSANDS OF TIME - AZTORIA REMIX\nhttps://go.protonradio.com/r/rlIZKx5uDuHaQ\n\nTHE INNER GROOVE - AZTORIA REMIX\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/theinnergroove\n\nBIRDS OF PARADISE - SINGLE - AZTORIA\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/birdsofparadise\n\nREBORN EP - AZTORIA & T-REX\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/reborn\n\n\nAztoria Latest Sets:\n\nAztoria @ Dimension Festival 2025\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aztoria/aztoria-dimension-festival-2025\n\nAztoria @ Spring Campout 2024\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aztoria/spring-campout-2024\n\nAztoria @ Rabbits Eat Lettuce 2024\nhttps://music.aztoria.au/rabbitseatlettuce2024\n\nAztoria @ Bello Bush Tech\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aztoria/bello-bush-tech\n\nBush Tech Vibes\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aztoria/bush-tech-vibes\n\nR18| ROAR",

    "long_description": "Wilson Blackley The Remain Tour with Oscar LaDell\nWilson Blackley The Remain Tour with Oscar LaDell.\n\nWilson Blackley is an Australian multi-instrumentalist and producer currently based in Melbourne.\n\nBorn and raised in Poowong (Victoria), Wilson was surrounded by music from an early age. At just 2 years old he started playing the drums along to his mother\u2019s music collection consisting of old soul, funk and r&b from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. He started learning the guitar as soon as he could, and had the habit of making anything he could get his hands on into an instrument. Growing up far from the city instilled a strong sense of curiosity and work ethic in him from a young age, leading him to produce his first batch of demos in his teenage years. A stand-out among these demos was the song \u2018Home\u2019\n\n\u2018Home\u2019 found its way to Sam Teskey (The Teskey Brothers) who would go on to co-produce the song alongside Wilson when he was just 18.\n\nFollowing the release of \u2018Home\u2019, he went on to sell out The Gasometer and play a string of festival slots alongside a variety of artists including The Teskey Brothers and Boy and Bear.\n\nAt this time, Wilson moved to St Kilda and in the heart of Melbourne began collaborating with Sensible J (Sampa The Great, Remi, Immy Owusu) on his debut EP \u2018Material Plane P1\u2019 which was released to critical acclaim in August 2022. After that, he co-produced Oscar LaDell\u2019s EP \u2018No Blue\u2019 and subsequently embarked on a co-headline tour of Aotearoa and Australia with LaDell. After a three year break from releasing music, Wilson Blackley will return with his new song \u2018Wired\u2019 that bridges the sonics from his first EP with what's to come.\n\nAlso appearing Oscar LaDell hot off a US tour.\n\nDoors open 8pm for an 8.30pm start.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Wilson Blackley The Remain Tour with Oscar LaDell.\nWilson Blackley is an Australian multi-instrumentalist and producer currently based in Melbourne.\nBorn and raised in Poowong (Victoria), Wilson was surrounded by music from an early age. At just 2 years old he started playing the drums along to his mother\u2019s music collection consisting of old soul, funk and r&b from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. He started learning the guitar as soon as he could, and had the habit of making anything he could get his hands on into an instrument. Growing up far from the city instilled a strong sense of curiosity and work ethic in him from a young age, leading him to produce his first batch of demos in his teenage years. A stand-out among these demos was the song \u2018Home\u2019\n\u2018Home\u2019 found its way to Sam Teskey (The Teskey Brothers) who would go on to co-produce the song alongside Wilson when he was just 18.\nFollowing the release of \u2018Home\u2019, he went on to sell out The Gasometer and play a string of festival slots alongside a variety of artists including The Teskey Brothers and Boy and Bear.\nAt this time, Wilson moved to St Kilda and in the heart of Melbourne began collaborating with Sensible J (Sampa The Great, Remi, Immy Owusu) on his debut EP \u2018Material Plane P1\u2019 which was released to critical acclaim in August 2022. After that, he co-produced Oscar LaDell\u2019s EP \u2018No Blue\u2019 and subsequently embarked on a co-headline tour of Aotearoa and Australia with LaDell. After a three year break from releasing music, Wilson Blackley will return with his new song \u2018Wired\u2019 that bridges the sonics from his first EP with what's to come.\nAlso appearing Oscar LaDell hot off a US tour.\nDoors open 8pm for an 8.30pm start.",

The time has finally come to celebrate the release of the Bri Louise Album.\nRogue & Vagabond on 24th of January.\n\nElly Mae and her band will be opening up before the Bri Louise Band takes the stage. The night will also feature some very special friends of ours, including Keira Batten-Copgan, Felix Hilton, Leji, Gala Baumfield, Meihana McGee, the Bri Louise Choir, and the Bri Louise Jazz Orchestra.\n\nHeres a few words about the two bands if you arnt acquainted with them:\n\nBri Louise blends sultry queerness with smooth love and undeniable groove. Rooted in gospel and neo-soul, their sound expands into a rich fusion of jazz, hip-hop, and R&B. Poetic lyricism is supported by a tight live band that features colourful keys, phatty bass, flashy beats, vibrant guitar, and fruity woodwinds. We will be joined by many guests but our core features Bri Louise (vocals/keys), Molly Wyatt (flute/vocals), Becky Devine (bass), Theo Thompson (guitar), Eloise Edmonds (saxophone), and Jonathan Stolk (drums).\n\nElly Mae crafts songs that encapsulate the bittersweet ache of growth, the quiet unraveling of time, and the soft glow of nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, indie, shoegaze, and anything in between. From lullabies that make you feel weightless to being wrapped in a blanket of sound, Elly Mae\u2019s folk/country melodic guitar style is accompanied by experimental, spatial bass from Arran Cargill-Brown and textured pocket drumming from Sasha Francis-Murray.\n\nCome celebrate this very special night and the release of this cool project with us.\nTickets available via UTR.

This is a special time in the History of Creation that so many seekers have been born on this Earth. They have realized that there is something beyond than the mundane life they have to seek. This is not the seeking of one life. It is the seeking of ages which is being prophesied, has to be fulfilled now. There have been prophesies and prophesies about this great time. In India about 14,000 years back, Brigu Muni has written a book called Nadi Grant in which He has described you all saying that a day that will come when all these greater seekers, great seekers will be born on this Earth and that their Kundalini which is the Power of their True Desire will be awakened spontaneously and they\u2019ll find out what they are.\n\nBut also there has been prophesies about many fake people coming on this Earth and they will try to delude and take people away from the truth.\n\nThere have been also great prophesies all over the world but especially in England about hundred years back a great poet called William Blake was born and He has written so clearly, so clearly about Sahaja Yoga that it is surprising how He has even exactly mentioned the house where I\u2019ll be staying. Also that he has said that the men of God, meaning the seekers, the men of God will become prophets and they will have the power to make others prophets. This is the sign we should take when we are seeking the truth.\n- Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi (Founder - Sahaja Yoga Meditation)\nBring in your friends and families too to this course :)\n#meditation #21 Day meditation # Sahaja Yoga #meditate #guided_meditation #classess #online #online_event #online_classes #online_meditation #yoga #online_meditation_class #meditation_class #meditation_course #peace #yoga_day#online_meditation_course #sahaja_yoga #spirituality #Yoga #kundalini #chakra #nadi #nirvicharita #workshop #seminar #spiritual_awakening#self_development #self_improvement #google #eventbrite #kundalini_activation #healing #kundalini_yoga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:45 PM - 03:00 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f Introduction & Recap\nInfo: If you missed the initial session, you are provided a one-on-one session in a breakout room to get you up to speed\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:00 PM - 03:30 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f Guided Meditation\nInfo: \u2744\ufe0f\u26c5Water, light, fire, sky, ground and other elements will be used to enhance the power of meditation and internal cleansing\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:30 PM - 03:45 PM\n\u2642\ufe0f One-to-one session (Optional)\nInfo: On-demand revision, healing, spiritual talks, technique practice, and more...\n\n\n\n",

    "long_description": "Dungeons & Dragons: Curse of Strahd Campaign - 26th January 2026\nOutside the tavern, a fog lies across the town. The damp, cobbled pavement glistens as the lights of street lanterns dance across the slick stones. The night chills the bones and shivers the soul of anyone outside.\n\nYet inside these tavern walls the food is hearty, and the ale is warm and frothy. A fire blazes in the hearth, and the tavern is alive with the voices and laughter.\n\nSuddenly, the tavern door swings open, and you all notice it at the same time. Framed by the lamp-lit fog, a form strides through the doorway. His brightly coloured clothes are draped in loose folds about him, and his hat hangs askew, hiding his eyes in shadows. Without hesitation, he walks up to your table and pulls from his tunic a sealed letter, addressed to all of you in beautiful flowing script. He drops the letter on the table and turns and leaves the tavern, vanishing into the fog.\n\n\u2018Curse of Strahd\u2019 is a D&D5E gothic horror campaign. It has everything you and your party needs to have a grand experience. It will take you to the mysterious village of Barovia, a realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by a wizard, the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, the master of Castle Ravenloft. \u2018Curse of Strahd\u2019 is a rich narrative story you are part of as it\u2019s unfolding. It\u2019s not just about fighting monsters and hunting for treasure in dungeons; there is a compelling story arc and a richly realized antagonist.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Inner Marlborough Sounds Kayak Trip\n\n\nHi this is a trip through the Inner Marlborough Sounds, suitable for beginners who have gone to at least one SKISL and be OK with rescues. The focus is on camping, coffee, and having a fun time with relatively short kayaking times on the water.\n\nThe schedule for Wellingtonians is: on the Thursday 29th Ferry over to Picton, in at 12:30, launch from Picton beach head over to Kumoto, tents up, Friday - paddle around the Bay of Many Coves, stop for coffee / lunch / chips / shower at Punga Cove, stay at Camp Bay. Maybe a quick trip over to Bumine Island with empty boats. Saturday night at Ratimira for camping / snoozing. Sunday - up early, on water at 8am, paddle back to Picton in by 12, lunch, on 1pm sailing. So 4 days with Blumine as an optional paddle, mostly shortish trips. We might shift the plan around depending on the weather, but that sets out the general plan.\n\nFor the ferry you need to book your own tickets and I would urge you to get your ferry tickets now as they go fast. If you are concerned about the weather get the fully refundable tickets. When you buy your ticket select the \"kayak\" option. Any questions ask them in the comments below.\n\nAlso check out other Trips & Adventurous Activities in Wellington.",

Weaving together synthesisers and swirling guitar strums with rock and jazz inspired drum beats, BADTAB creates a unique and refreshing sound. The band made their mark in 2024 with a prolific run of releases. September saw the drop of The P\u014dneke Sessions, collaborative EP with Cellz. Then came December\u2019s Echo Chambers Of\u2026, their full-length debut album that introduced the world to BADTAB\u2019s expansive soundscape. Since the release of their debut album, they have been deep in the works on their sophomore album which is anticipated for a 2026 summer release.\n\nBri Louise blends sultry queer with smooth love and undeniable groove. Their sound has roots in Gospel and Neo-Soul, evolving into a rich fusion of Jazz, Hip-Hop, and R&B. Bri\u2019s music features a talented live band that supports their poetic lyrics with colourful keys, phatty bass, flashy beats, vibrant guitar and fruity woodwinds.\n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue. Minors are of course not allowed to purchase alcohol under any circumstance.",

Let's create a 2026 that is amazing.\n\nEach new year we are encouraged to think about new year\u2019s resolutions. As we know these often don\u2019t play out, we are unable to follow through or we lose momentum or we just make them unachievable.\n\nThe purpose of this workshop is to explore what you might want to create, change, or stabilise during 2026 through the exploration and the identification of a word that brings the energy you want for the year.\n\nI have been working with this concept of a word for a number of years now and always when I reflect at the closing of the year, I can identify how this has played out during the year. It works! Reset was my word for 2025!!!\n\nOn the day we will have a gentle yoga practice (all levels), meditation and journalling prompted by a framework (you\u2019ll find out on the day) that encourages us to open up to the possibilities of 2026 and to set a clear intention of what we want from the year and how one word can energise that intention.\n\nI will provide some materials for you to create a vision board if that is your intention to do so. I will also provide material (or a framework in corporate speak) to support you in your reflections on what it is that you want in 2026.\n\nInvestment is $60. If you want to explore Nga Manu as well, I would definitely encourage that, we can provide you with a discounted access ticket of $15.\n\n",

Gamma brainwaves are associated with states of deep meditation, heightened awareness, and higher brain functions.\n\nBreathwork and other deeply meditative practices activate gamma waves and there is a correlation between gamma waves and DMT release, with one seeming to stimulate the other.\n\nBreathwork experiences and benefits so often parallel those of DMT and other psychedelic plant-medicines, DMT is produced naturally in the brain, and is released during Breathwork.\n\n\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude46 \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4e:\n\n\u2022 Anxiety, depression and stress\n\n\u2022 Increase energy & boost immunity\n\n\u2022 Improves sleep\n\n\u2022 Lowers blood pressure & improves circulation\n\n\u2022 Improves mood & self esteem & helps manage depression\n\n\u2022 Relese toxins\n\n\u2022 Helps manage pain & restrictions in the body\n\n\u2022 Releasing trauma & emotion & manage PTSD\n\n\u2022 Gaining body awareness\n\n\u2022 Connecting to intuition and receiving guidance\n\n\u2022 Past life clearing and understanding\n\n\u2022 Spiritual awakening and expansion\n\n\u2022 Karmic release and ancestral work\n\n\u2022 Increasing creativity and self-expression\n\n\u2022 Life purpose clarity\n\nA breathwork journey is unique to each person and and the results are profound.\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a \ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4f:\n\n\u2022 Doors will open at 3:00pm and you will have a few moments to get grounded and set up for your \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b experience.\n\n\u2022 We will open up with an introduction to this \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b technique and prepare to start the Breathwork Medicine Journey.\n\n\u2022 You will then be guided through a 90 minute experience recieving healing & expansion bridging the gap between your human self & higher self.\n\n\u2022 Your only job is to be open minded, relax, and let your breath guide you on this medicine journey be open to receive any healing or guidance that comes up throughout the journey.\n\n\u2022 We will close of with an intergration circle finishing up at 5:30PM and have an hour break, to ground, nourish our bodies, and have a swim before we prepare for the Sound Bath at 6:30PM.\n\n\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude68:\n\nBreathwork results in certain specific physiological changes in the body and also can result in intense physical and emotional release.\n\nAs a precaution, the following conditions are contraindicated in certain breathwork practices.\n\nIt is crucial that you inform your breathwork practitioner if any of the following conditions are relevant to you:\n\n\u2022 Pregnancy (at any stage)\n\n\u2022 Severe PTSD or trauma\n\n\u2022 Currently using recreational drugs\n\n\u2022 Recent surgery\n\n\u2022 Taking any medication that alters brain chemistry like anti-anxiety,anti-depressant, ADD, OCD medications, etc.\n\n\u2022Detached Retina\n\n\u2022Glaucoma\n\n\u2022Kidney disease\n\n\u2022High Blood Pressure\n\n\u2022Cardiovascular disease, including angina, previous heart attack or stroke\n\u2022Diagnosis of aneurysm in the brain or abdomen\n\n\u2022Uncontrolled thyroid conditions\n\n\u2022Diabetes\n\n\u2022Severe Asthma\u2014 for mild to moderate asthma, we can discuss but you must bring your inhaler to the session.\n\n\u2022 Epilepsy\n\n\u2022 History of Seizures\n\n\u2022 Prior diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or previous psychiatric condition.\n\n\u2022Any other medical, psychiatric or physical conditions which would impair or affect the ability to engage in any activities that involve deep physical and/or emotional release.\n\n\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4c\u2019\ud835\ude68:\n\nWhat can I expect?\n\nThere will be a short guided meditation, explanation of conscious connected breathwork (how to do it, tetany, things that may happen etc), a full 60 min breathwork journey and space afterwards for a few to share about their experience and any questions asked and support given if needed.\n\nI have one or more of the listed contraindications -

Visceral and cathartic shows where crushing riffs & sprawling drones collide with extended bursts of wild improvisation. In 2024, the band released their critically acclaimed album The Healer, a sweeping, transformative work spanning four monumental tracks. The record dives deep into themes of regeneration, suffering, and spiritual reconstruction \u2014 a testament to the band\u2019s ability to meld raw power with emotional depth.\n\nThe experimental metal trio\u2019s four-song, 76-minute album is the peak of their career. It\u2019s dense and invigorating, highlighting the band\u2019s dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. - Pitchfork\n\nSoon after the release SUMAC teamed up with poet and sound artist Moor Mother to release The Film, a boundary-pushing collaborative album. Released via Thrill Jockey in April 2025, the record unfolds as a cinematic journey across eight \u201cscenes,\u201d merging SUMAC\u2019s heavy, jazz-inflected textures with Moor Mother\u2019s incisive spoken-word commentary.\n\nSUMAC\u2019s work has always been about transition between different states of being.

Choose between doing your own thing, or jumping on a serene cruise of the Whanganui River onboard the coal fired paddle steamer \"PS Waimarie\".\n\nLeaving Kapiti as most others are still sound asleep, we quickly escape the coast and delve into the rurality of the Horowhenua. After a stop in Palmerston North we head up the trunk through the townships of Feilding and Marton before turning onto the Marton - New Plymouth railway line for the last stretch into Whanganui. After crossing the 290km long Whanganui River, we proceed slowly down the short 5km branch line taking us to Taupo Quay.\n\nTRAVEL ON THE PADDLE STEAMER WAIMARIE!\nSalvaged from the bottom of the Whanganui River where she sat for around 50 years, the Paddle Steamer Waimarie was restored to her former glory and re-launched in 2000. She is now the only one of her kind in operation in New Zealand. Your cruise leaves the Riverboat Centre Wharf and heads upriver taking in the scenery and views of Whanganui which can only be experienced from Te Awa Tupua, the Whanganui River. The commentary shares riverboat history and points of interest along the way. Check out the boiler that powers our paddle steamer, and maybe meet the homing pigeons and send a message with them on their flight back to the Riverboat Centre.\n\nDeparting Paekakariki/Paraparaumu/Waikanae/Otaki/Levin\nAdult 13+ yrs - $209\nChild 2-12yrs - $179\n\nDeparting Palmerston North/Feilding\nAdult 13+ yrs - $189\nChild 2-12yrs - $169\n\nBuses will transport you from your arrival at the station to the Waimarie River Boat Centre.\n\nDO YOUR OWN THING!\nThere will be a collection of vintage cruiser bikes for hire for a small fee to those keen to take exploring to the next level.\n\nThere will be short tours available at the Durie Hill Elevator. It is New Zealand\u2019s only public transport elevator and is still used on a daily basis by locals and visitors.\n\nThere are multiple places to go, and things to see on a cruiser bike or on foot. Take a tram ride for a small fee and arrive at the Riverboat museum, be blown away by NZ Glassworks, admire the sculptures and views from the Motua gardens along the river, indulge in local cuisine, or simply shop local.\n\nDeparting Paekakariki/Paraparaumu/Waikanae/Otaki/Levin\nAdult 13+ yrs - $159\nChild 2-12yrs - $139\n\nDeparting Palmerston North/Feilding\nAdult 13+ yrs - $139\nChild 2-12yrs - $119\n\nBook at https://steaminc.org.nz/book-train-trip/river-city-express/\n\n",

    "long_description": "Ludovico Einaudi | Wellington - Michael Fowler Centre\nLudovico Einaudi\nSunday 1 February 2026\nMichael Fowler Centre\n\nThe world\u2019s most popular classical music composer, Italian pianist, Ludovico Einaudi, returns to Australia and New Zealand this January with his new album The Summer Portraits.\n\nHe has performed on an Arctic ice-floe for Greenpeace and has seen his music become the soundtrack for Oscar and Golden Globe winning films ('Les Intouchables', 'Nomadland', 'The Father') and TikTok phenomena (his 2012 track 'Experience' exploded on the app) alike. From his earliest work composing for theatre and ballet in the 1980s to his multi-million-selling albums like 'In a Time Lapse' and his popular soundtracks across film and television, Einaudi has drawn upon neo-classical, pop, ambient, rock and experimental styles to create a sound that crosses boundaries and generations, becoming the world\u2019s best known \u2013 and most streamed \u2013 classical music artist in the process.\n\nIn January 2025, Einaudi released 'The Summer Portraits'. The record is a lush return to full-band textures and is the result of a cascade of personal memories triggered by sun, summer and family holidays. On his last Australian tour, before a gig at the Sydney Opera House, Einaudi sat down and started composing the single 'Rose Bay', based on his sense impressions of the bay his grandfather made home.\n\nDon\u2019t miss your chance to experience the world\u2019s most popular contemporary classical artist.\n\n",

How do we protect and share our heritage?\n\nAbout this Event\n\nPublic artworks are more than simple decoration. They hold stories of place, identity and change. When the spaces around them shift, those stories can be at risk. Who carries responsibility for protecting heritage works, and how do we ensure they remain part of our shared future?\nThe early spark for The Wheel of Avalon began when artist Bronwyn Holloway-Smith was invited to Avalon TV Studios in her role as Co-Director of Public Art Heritage Aotearoa New Zealand. There, viewing Bill McCardle\u2019s mosaic mural, she reflected: \u201cThe story of the mural feels like a metaphor for the rise and fall of Avalon Studios.\u201d\nJoin Holloway-Smith for an engaging and thought-provoking talk exploring this work alongside a Guy Ngan mural in Naenae and a piece by E. Mervyn Taylor in Taita. Together, these three recent projects reveal different approaches to safeguarding the Hutt\u2019s public art heritage and open a conversation about what proactive, future-focused care and preservation of public art could look like in the years ahead.\n\nDr Bronwyn Holloway-Smith (P\u0101keh\u0101) is an award-winning conceptual artist, author, and researcher. Her interdisciplinary practice spans public art, digital media and deep-dive research, often focused on the tangled legacies of cultural memory, P\u0101keh\u0101 identity, and the politics of preservation. She lives on P\u014dneke's rugged south coast with her partner and their three offspring.\n\n",

    "long_description": "This class is for level 2+ and advanced students. It is not open to beginners.\n\nStudents must have completed an 8-week block with ring-making and bezel settings or equivalent. If you have not done one of our 8-week beginner\u2019s classes or are unsure of your level because you may have done a few different shorter classes, please contact us, and we can advise you.\n\nThis more advanced class is ideal for those who are already competent at soldering simple joins, annealing and basic tool use on their own.\n\nA more advanced set of students means that your tutor can support you and the group to take on more exciting and complex challenges. They will work with the group to find appropriate projects for you and for the class as a whole. Each 8-week block may focus on a particular skill topic, rather than doing loads of different topics with each student over the block. This means the students will benefit from a more in-depth learning experience, supported practice and peer support from fellow students.\n\nLevel 2 students learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking as a way to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project so they have something to hone their skills that they are familiar with, as well as take on a new skill. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet or a more complex bezel setting.\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple projects they can work on self-directed in class: more chains or simple bezel settings are ideal - to help them strengthen their soldering skills - alongside a challenge project that might be a shelf setting (an adaptation of a bezel setting that can take faceted stones), a tube setting or a larger bezel setting for a box or brooch.\n\nThis class fee does NOT include materials for any student.\n\nAll metals and stones, as well as quality findings and chains, are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it thriftily in future projects!\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking. If you do not have access to these payment methods or need to pay your course fee over time please email us to arrange this ;)",

This way, you will learn the basics as you go on your practice ring, before taking the next step in costly silver.\n\nThis class has all materials included in the class fee!\n\nEach student receives a carefully curated materials pack including copper or brass, sterling and fine silver for your ring-making projects, as well as two stones from our supply so you get a good stone for your level of experience.\n\nWe have loads of gorgeous stones of a range of colours, and they are all appropriate for beginner settings.\n\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking.

At Wellington Classic Literature Club, we read novels that have stood the test of time, whether they were written in 1780, 1880 or even 1980. We meet on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nWe return to Russia for our long summer read! The group's first-ever summer book was Anna Karenina, and we read Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov over the 2018/19 summer. (We were also due to discuss his novel Crime and Punishment, but that was set down for April 2020 and, well, the world had other plans\u2026)\n\nThis year, we read another of Fyodor Dostoevsky's masterworks: The Idiot, which was initially published as a serial in 1868-1869. Dostoevsky scholar Joseph Frank said The Idiot \"is the most personal of all his major works, the book in which he embodies his most intimate, cherished, and sacred convictions.\"\n\nThe story revolves around Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin, a young man returning to Russia after spending several years in a Swiss sanatorium for epilepsy. Dostoevsky had set out to create a protagonist with \"a truly beautiful soul\" and to trace the fate of such an individual as he comes into contact with the brutal reality of contemporary society.\n\nRSVP\nIf you use Facebook, you can RSVP to the event on our Facebook page (above) - it really helps us keep track of numbers. Otherwise, just come along...\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place. After you enter the bar, head to your right (up the step) and through a smaller space with booths to the large carpeted space beyond.\n\nABOUT US\nWellington Classic Literature Club has been running for more than a decade - since the start of 2013 - and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers who come along for particular books or simply when it suits. All welcome.",

Driven by groove and the desire to find meaning in the moments on this journey we call life, the musician, songwriter and producer has a signature sound that stands out and stuns. Fowles would describe his music as psychedelic soul laced with blues and funk. It resonates with deep grooves and driving rhythms created by vintage drum sounds, digital sonics, and electric guitars that build and blaze into billowing soundscapes. At its core is his unique, soulful voice and the punchy, heartfelt lyrics he wears on his sleeve.\n\nElly Mae crafts songs that encapsulate the bittersweet ache of growth, the quiet unraveling of time, and the soft glow of nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, indie, shoegaze, and anything in between. From lullabies that make you feel weightless to being wrapped in a blanket of sound, Elly Mae's folk/country melodic guitar style is accompanied by experimental, spatial bass from Arran Cargill-Brown and textured pocket drumming from Sasha Francis-Murray. \n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

The moon reveals our emotional landscape, our inner rhythms, and often the fears that arise when we dare to live that full expression. Together, they form a powerful dialogue between structure and flow, logic and emotion, masculine and feminine.\n\nIn this workshop, Clare will guide you into an embodied exploration of your own sun and moon, inviting you to feel these two archetypes within your body and notice where they support, resist, or balance each other.\n\nBryony will lead you into vocal practices that bring these energies into sound and voice \u2014 giving expression to what is often left unspoken. Through voice, you\u2019ll release what holds you back and discover new harmony between your inner and outer selves.\n\nThis full moon is the perfect moment to unleash the voices of your sun and moon \u2014 and to step more fully into clarity, balance, and authentic expression.\n\nThe timing of this workshop gives you a unique opportunity to tune into these planets and benefit from their placement in the collective astrology.\n\nThe workshop will begin with the opportunity to explore powerful, enjoyable, accessible Voice Practices which open, align and strengthen your expression - and create physiological changes in your energy field.\n\nWe will then directly, bodily experience the energies of each of the Celestial Bodies through Embodied Astrology, guided by Clare.\n\nWe will integrate these energies, through further Voice Practices, including improvisation, healing chants and songs.\n\nThese two modalities will be carefully interwoven in an enjoyable, rich day's workshop that will benefit all participants.\n\nThere will be guided space in the workshop to integrate the energetic shifts and discoveries of both the Voice Practices and the Astrology.\n\nThis special workshop takes place on Saturday February 7th, 10am-4.30pm - we hope you can join us\n\nAt the Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Paraparaumu.\n\nINVESTMENT:\n\nYour investment for this day is $233. Shared lunch.\nSome concessions are available - please contact us by email .\n\nPayment by card here - https://buy.stripe.com/aEU3g1gMecNj2SkbJI\n\nPlease contact us with any questions at all.\n\n",

Featuring elements of indie rock, alt-country and emo, McCall\u2019s songs address the uncertainties of life with warmth, wit, and emotional immediacy.\n\nswan follows FOAP\u2019s 2022 debut album, it\u2019ll all work out, which featured \u201cnuggets of genius lyricism\u201d (RNZ). This new body of work will see McCall, with bandmates Rassani Tolovaa (Office Dog), Hamish Morgan (Marlin\u2019s Dreaming, School Fair), and Shaun Malloch (Mim Jensen), expand from the Pavement-esque tuneful indie rock of previous releases to include pedal steel, fiddle, drum machines, and synthesisers. While there is a diversity of style, the album is rooted in the hallmarks of McCall\u2019s music: uplifting and catchy guitar lines that serve the song, paired with arrangements that feel both comfortable and surprising. Where the lyrics tell a sad story, the music betrays that it might just be okay in the end.\n\n",

My Nonno (Leslie George Moleta) spotted my Nonna (Rosina Elvira Barnao) at the Zino-Toscano wedding where she was a bridesmaid. They had two children, both named after their grandparents as was the tradition.

    "long_description": "This is another opportunity to explore charming Greytown houses and gardens where the owners have valued and enhanced the integrity of the building and its environment, and so nurtured Greytown's heritage.\n\nGreytown Heritage Trust offers this self-guided tour, unveiling nine remarkable properties along with three destination events. A newly opened countryside caf\u00e9, spoiling with on-site baking, offers a pause looking out towards the Tararua range. A barbecue in a bucolic Waiohine setting. A f\u00eate, nostalgically redolent of yesteryear, selling perennials, crafts and home produce. There will be Devonshire cream teas and Wairarapa Ros\u00e9 and bubbly, bunting, adventure and indulgence. How could you resist?\nThe houses are further flung than the previous tour and we listened hard to feedback \u2013 fewer destinations but greater distances will mean you\u2019ll more comfortably explore this charming town and it\u2019s houses and gardens.\nYou\u2019re invited to spend a summer\u2019s day exploring remarkable houses and gardens in this attractive town. In so doing you will contribute to a fundraiser for the refurbishment of Greytown's colonial-settler K\u014duka Cottage (c1860) at Stella Bull Park, 113 Main Street, Greytown. This cottage and its maintenance are important in fostering Greytown's architectural heritage.\nReceive with your ticket:\nAccess to 9 of Greytown\u2019s significant private homes & gardens. Access to a f\u00eate, a caf\u00e9 and a countryside barbecue.\nA quality keepsake folding map & information poster. These will be posted to you nearer to the date.\n\nGeneral information & conditions\nProperties are open from 10.00am until 4.30pm. This tour is self-guided; you can visit the properties in any order you wish.\nEach ticket holder will be sent a map and wristbands for entry, by post. It is absolutely critical that you include your address on your Eventfinda registration and purchase of tickets.\nAt each venue you\u2019re asked to present your wristband to the volunteers at the entrance to gain access. Please ensure that you are wearing your wristband during the tour as this will ensure your entry at each address. The wristband isn't transferable to other people during the tour events.\nThe houses, of course, are private homes. Photographs are available on the Greytown Heritage Trust\u2019s media sites and we ask that you don\u2019t take your own photographs inside houses, nor touch furnishings or items. Some areas will be inaccessible and signed accordingly. Some gardens may also be off limits for photography but this will be indicated at the venue.\nKeeping people and property safe is important, this tour is reserved for those aged over 15. We\u2019re also asking that no animals are brought to the visits unless they are mobility-trained and certified. Accessibility is compromised variously in houses and some gardens.\nGreytown public toilets will be marked on the map.\nThe tour will proceed regardless of rain or other moderately poor weather but there may be a cancellation in the event of Met Office amber or red warnings. In this, what we hope is unlikely, event we will communicate with you by email and on social media sites.\nCash sales and some eftpos facilities will be available at some properties. The proceeds or proportions of these sales will also contribute to the fundraiser.\nThe Trust is grateful for your support, and wish you a wonderful day exploring and enjoying Greytown\u2019s heritage properties.\nLinks\nWebsite (for more heritage info):\nhttps://www.greytownheritagetrust.co.nz/\nSocial Media (for sneak peaks of the tour):\nhttps://www.instagram.com/greytownheritagetrust/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/greytownheritagetrust",

    "long_description": "On the 12 February 1909, the SS Penguin sank in Cook Strait in a raging southerly storm with the loss of 72 lives, one of the worst maritime disasters in NZ history.  Many of those who died were woman and children, as their lifeboats capsized in the wild sea. \nAlthough the Captain was heavily criticised, it is still not clear what the ship hit nor where, as the wreck of the Penguin has never been located. \nThe tragedy stunned Wellington and a day of mourning was called for 16 February.  The city came to a standstill as many of those who died were brought up to Karori Cemetery for burial in a long procession of cabs and lorries.\nTo commemorate this tragedy the Friends will be undertaking a guided tour of most of the Penguin graves on Sunday 8th February. \nThe tour duration is approximately 2 hours long.\nThis tour is suitable for people with moderate fitness. The route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. Surefootedness is required.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee). Children under 12 are free.\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nNote:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you one hour before the tour start time by email and on our Facebook page. The booking fee is non-refundable.\nPlease dress appropriately for the conditions. While we do our best to guide you on a safe walking route, during the winter months the ground can become slippery in places.\nSome of our walks require a moderate degree of fitness and are not suited for those with limited mobility. Please read the tour descriptions carefully to check that they will be suitable for you.\nThere is only one toilet which is located by the cemetery office at the main entrance.\nPlease meet us at the shelter (shown as the Historic Chapel on the map at the main entrance)\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Karori Cemetery.",

He\u2019s toured nearly nonstop across Canada, the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere ever since, living out of backpacks and campervans, averaging over a hundred shows and a dozen summer festivals a year, and distilling his experiences into empathetic, keenly observant verse. Since 2022 he\u2019s been joined full-time by his sweetheart Pamela Mae on upright bass and vocals, crisscrossing 45 US States and 8 Canadian provinces in their campervan Roadetta, and covering a fair bit of Australia in their HiAce Hector. In 2026 they\u2019re bringing the duo project to New Zealand for the first time with an extensive tour of the North and South Islands in support of Cook's eighth album Troubadourly Yours. Fresh from the open road, these are sturdy, straight-talking songs that see the good in you.\n\n\u201cWhip-smart, bone-achingly lovely, socially committed songs presented with a bold, elegant directness evoking the very best of the folk music tradition. Last night's performance in Notional Space was a thing of rare beauty.\u201d \u2014Mark Jacobs, presenter, Notional Space\n\n\u201cHe sings his heart and soul, and in doing so lets light flood into your own... He has a good eye for imagery, a gentle human touch, a wry sense of humour, a whole lot of integrity, a warm, rugged voice and a bunch of memorable lines... Truly one of Woody Guthrie's children.\u201d \u2013RnR Magazine",

    "long_description": "Christoph Gallio / Phil Durrant\nPhil Durrant (electric mandolin and electronics) and Christoph Gallio (saxophones) are veterans of the international free improvisation scene. Their individual and collaborative projects have helped shape the development of improvised music. They first worked together over 40 years ago, but it wasn\u2019t until 2022 that they started performing as a duo. It is rare that improvisors of their calibre make it out to NZ, so we\u2019re very happy to host them at Pyramid Club for a duo concert plus collaborative sets with local musicians.\n\nPhil Durrant (London, UK) is a multi-instrumentalist improviser, composer and sound artist. As a violinist he was one of the key exponents of the \u2018group voice approach\u2019 style of improvised music, performing as a member of the Butcher/Russell/Durrant trio, News From The Shed and the Chris Burn Ensemble. In the late 90s, his influential trio with Radu Malfatti and Thomas Lehn represented a shift to a more reductionist approach. As a synthesiser player, Durrant performs with Bertrand Denzler and Burkhard Beins in Trio Sowari. He is also a member of the international electronic ensemble MIMEO with Keith Rowe, Kaffe Matthews, Thomas Lehn and Rafael Toral. He has performed all over Europe and Canada and released CDs and records on Acta and Emanem Records.\n\nSwiss saxophonist and composer Christoph Gallio studied classical saxophone with Iwan Roth at the Basel Music Conservator and then with Steve Lacy in Paris. He has collaborated with many of the world\u2019s leading voices in improvisation including Irene Schweizer, Urs Blo\u0308chlinger, Mani Neumeier, Peter Kowald, Fred Frith, Haco, Tetsu Saitoh, Phil Minton, Pablo Diaz, Marcelo von Schultz, Olie Brice, Andrew Lisle, Cath Roberts, Irene Aebi, William Parker, Rashied Ali, Matthew Ostrowski, Gerry Hemingway, Sven-A\u030ake Johansson, Olaf Rupp, Jan Roder, Oli Steidle, Andrea Neumann, Ernst Thoma, Julian Sartorius, Nicolas Stocker, Paula Shocron, Sergio Merce, Alistair Zaldua, Phil Durrant, Roger Turner, Dominic Lash, Mark Sanders and many more. Gallio has been running his own label PERCASO since 1986.\n\nwww.gallio.ch\n\nDurrant and Gallio will perform a duo set, and then be joined by local improvising musicians Tom Callwood (bass), Jake Baxendale (sax) and Daniel Beban (guitar/tapes).\n\nTheir tour is sponsored by Swiss Arts Council, Aargauer Kuratorium, City of Baden, SIS (Schweizerische Interpreten Stiftung) and Fondation SUISA.\n\n\n$20 presale tickets via UTR\n$35 donation tickets\n$15 unwaged door sales\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

Featuring not one, not two, but THREE of P\u014dneke\u2019s premier acts to close our 2026 series out.\n\nDillon Jo is the genre defying project of Wellington Based artists Betty Smith and Georgie Levien. Dillon Jo built paths between the elements of dream pop, shoegaze, folk, alt rock, and indie pop to create their genre defying sound. Having recently recruited Kahu Sanson-Burnett and Ruadh Munro, Dillon Jo has transformed their live sets into an unbridled big-sound shoegaze experience.\nMiles Calder released his solo debut album Autopilot Life in 2021, a self-reflective delve into waking up from an unexamined life, dressed in a psychedelic folk-rock palette that evoked late-era Beatles as much as contemporaries like Kevin Morby and Father John Misty. The album won over new fans and critics alike & led to a nomination for a prestigious Aotearoa Music Award (Te Kaipuoro Taketake Toa | Best Folk Artist 2022). \n\nKeira Batten Coogan writes raw and messy music for alien listeners. Joined onstage by some familiar P\u014dneke talent, his earnest earworms pack more punch than ever. Themes of queerness, growing pains, love, and nostalgia shine through his lyricism and captivates audiences. \n\n\nSan Fran holds a Supervised License, meaning minors are welcome to attend events at San Fran so long as they are accompanied by a legal guardian at all times whilst at the venue.

I can't think of the last time I met so many wonderful, open-minded people in one go like that. It was a real pleasure\u201d - John\n\n\nTired of endless scrolling?\n\n\nOver the superficiality of app culture?\n\n\nReady to connect with real people and talk about what truly matters?\n\n\nHere\u2019s your chance take a break from the apps and connect more openly and authentically with those both like-minded and different. After a long break, it's returning to Wellington this February for Valentine's weekend!\n\n\nYou\u2019ll have several encounters throughout the night. Each will be carefully guided, inviting you to be yourself, to communicate openly, and and explore multiples layers and flavours of connection. Come spark a new summer flame! \ud83d\udd25\n\n\nAuthentic Dating welcomes all men, women & non-binary people aged 18+, both monogamous & non-monogamous. We will aim to pair you with a gender different from your own.\n\n\nIs this event for me?\n\nIf you are seeking....\n\n\u2728 Deep & meaningful conversations without small talky chit-chat\n\n\u2728 Exciting new connections, both romantic & platonic\n\n\u2728 An opportunity to explore & challenge your assumptions\n\n\u2728 A substance-free environment\n\n\u2728 Playful & sincere communication activities\n\n\u2728 Skills you can apply to your dating life beyond the event\n\n\u2728 A space to simply be yourself\n\n....then this event is for you!\n\n\nWhat will actually happen? \ud83e\udd70\n\nYou will be invited to explore four unique interactions, some of which are randomised and some of which you can choose. Each will involve a new set of instructions to help you communicate about topics that really matter to you.\n\nEach interaction will last 10-15 minutes. At the end of each interaction, you will have the opportunity to share a contact detail on a piece of paper in a way that is both cute and discrete ~ please bring your own pen!\n\nConsent is important: you always have the agency to choose how deep you go. You will never be forced to share information that you don't want to.\n\n\nWhy are tickets sold by gender? \ud83d\udc6b\n\nTo ensure that the gender balance is as even as possible, it is important to keep track of how many men/women/non-binary people are signing up. If a particular gender is over-represented in the run-up to the event, we do our best to ensure that under-represented gender(s) also sign up.\n\nWhile we aim to achieve an even balance of genders (and ages), this is not always possible. However, what is guaranteed are skills that you can apply to any connection. Simply come with an open mind and ready to connect.\n\n\nThe facilitator \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nLaurie King\n\nI'm Laurie (he/him), a queer British-Kiwi who\u2019s current home-base is Berlin.

Many emotions were felt in the safest, most welcoming environment\" - Jason\n\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful workshop you ran last night. I walked away with a sense of renewed self worth and also questioned why I don\u2019t articulate comfortably what I want. It\u2019s the perfect antidote to app culture.\u201d - Imogen\n\n\n\u201cLaurie created a beautiful, safe space in no time, making it an ideal environment to be present and engage meaningfully with the activities.

    "long_description": "\u201cThank you so much for creating a space in which such well-aligned people could come together. I can't think of the last time I met so many wonderful, open-minded people in one go like that. It was a real pleasure\u201d - John\n\n\nTired of endless scrolling?\n\nOver the superficiality of app culture?\n\nReady to connect with real people and talk about what truly matters?\n\nHere\u2019s your chance take a break from the apps and connect more openly and authentically with those both like-minded and different. After a long break, it's returning to Wellington this February for Valentine's weekend!\n\nYou\u2019ll have several encounters throughout the night. Each will be carefully guided, inviting you to be yourself, to communicate openly, and and explore multiples layers and flavours of connection. Come spark a new summer flame! \ud83d\udd25\n\nAuthentic Dating welcomes all men, women & non-binary people aged 18+, both monogamous & non-monogamous. We will aim to pair you with a gender different from your own.\n\n\nIs this event for me?\n\nIf you are seeking....\n\n\u2728 Deep & meaningful conversations without small talky chit-chat\n\n\u2728 Exciting new connections, both romantic & platonic\n\n\u2728 An opportunity to explore & challenge your assumptions\n\n\u2728 A substance-free environment\n\n\u2728 Playful & sincere communication activities\n\n\u2728 Skills you can apply to your dating life beyond the event\n\n\u2728 A space to simply be yourself\n\n....then this event is for you!\n\n\nWhat will actually happen? \ud83e\udd70\n\nYou will be invited to explore four unique interactions, some of which are randomised and some of which you can choose. Each will involve a new set of instructions to help you communicate about topics that really matter to you.\n\nEach interaction will last 10-15 minutes. At the end of each interaction, you will have the opportunity to share a contact detail on a piece of paper in a way that is both cute and discrete ~ please bring your own pen!\n\nConsent is important: you always have the agency to choose how deep you go. You will never be forced to share information that you don't want to.\n\n\nWhy are tickets sold by gender? \ud83d\udc6b\n\nTo ensure that the gender balance is as even as possible, it is important to keep track of how many men/women/non-binary people are signing up. If a particular gender is over-represented in the run-up to the event, we do our best to ensure that under-represented gender(s) also sign up.\n\nWhile we aim to achieve an even balance of genders (and ages), this is not always possible. However, what is guaranteed are skills that you can apply to any connection. Simply come with an open mind and ready to connect.\n\n\nThe facilitator \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nLaurie King\n\nI'm Laurie (he/him), a queer British-Kiwi who\u2019s current home-base is Berlin. My passion is creating spaces that cultivate healthy, thriving human-to-human relationships, helping people take off their masks, feel their sensations and celebrate their aliveness on Earth. Since 2019, I have organised and facilitated hundreds of Authentic Relating, Dating and Embodiment workshops in Oceania and Europe.\n\nMy training includes The Embody Lab, Authentic Revolution, Body Electric, Connection Institute and World Peace Yoga School. I have facilitated at internationally acclaimed festivals such as Stretch and Ignite, and organisations such as ART International and Authentic Bay Area.\n\nMy workshops have sparked thousands of nourishing connections, turning many strangers into life-long friends. I look forward to holding space for you!\n\nI also offer online Holistic Coaching sessions, inspired by Authentic Relating, Positive Intelligence and Somatic Experiencing techniques.\n\nFor more information, check out itoiauthenticrelating.com.\n\nFor my Instagram, check out @itoiauthentic.\n\ni to i Authentic Dating has already been a big hit in Wellington, as well as Auckland, Christchurch, Berlin, Amsterdam, Melbourne, Sydney, Vienna, Copenhagen, London, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Montreal.\n\nHere\u2019s what others have said:\n\n\"This has been the most positive experience I've had in meeting genuine souls with the intention of finding love/romance for over 6 years\" - Luca\n\n\"Laurie led us through a series of games and exercises that allowed us to open up and create very real bonds with others and with our own selves. Many emotions were felt in the safest, most welcoming environment\" - Jason\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful workshop you ran last night. I walked away with a sense of renewed self worth and also questioned why I don\u2019t articulate comfortably what I want. It\u2019s the perfect antidote to app culture.\u201d - Imogen\n\n\u201cLaurie created a beautiful, safe space in no time, making it an ideal environment to be present and engage meaningfully with the activities. Even though all participants were strangers to me, I felt a deep sense of belonging developing over the evening.\u201d - Tim\n\n\u201cThank you so much for creating a space in which such well-aligned people could come together.

Audiences are invited to arrive early, explore the space, and meet the motley cast of lovers and fools before the story even begins.

Whilst RateYourMusic users described the album as \u201chedonistic, energetic, vulgar, rhythmic, urban, and heavy,\u201d capturing the raw essence of its sound and attitude. With over 450,000 copies sold worldwide, Broke remains a defining moment in the nu-metal era and this tour is your chance to relive it live.\n\nExpect pounding riffs, funk-infused grooves, and the unmistakable flow of frontman Jahred Gomes, whose stage presence turns every show into a riotous celebration of rebellion and rhythm. From their self-titled debut in 1997 to their latest release New and Improved, (HED) P.E. continues to evolve while staying true to their anti-establishment roots.\n\nDebuting in New Zealand for the first time and with an incredible career spanning nearly three decades, Nonpoint has long been a force to be reckoned with in the nu-metal/rap-rock genre. Known for legendary live performances and explosive tracks such as Bullet with a Name, What a Day, Ruthless, and more, the band has consistently captivated audiences with infectious riffs, compelling lyrics, and an uncompromising raw energy. Their discography and stagecraft have made them staples at rock radio and fixtures on festival lineups, earning them a dedicated international following.\n\nThis is not nostalgia, it\u2019s a full-blown sonic nu-metal assault. Don\u2019t miss (HED) P.E. and NONPOINT as they rip through Australia with setlists that traverse decades, defy genres, and unleash pure, unfiltered chaos!\n\n",

    "long_description": "STEAMS is an integrated approach to learning topics of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths, and Society that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. Its aim is to teach real world skills through engaging methods whilst allowing individuals to be creative. This involves immersing tamariki into projects and activities that develop innovation and champion curiosity. STEAMS is not \u2018play based learning\u2019 but focused learning through an integrated hands-on approach allowing children to take risks and explore their own curiosity in a subject without time barriers.\nAt the Ministry of Inspiration we offer STEAMS learning each term for Year 1-8 students. Once a week students will attend a class at Waterlea Racecourse, Blenheim on TUESDAY or THURSDAY. STEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) start at 9am and finish at 2:45pm on TUESDAY. Little STEAMerS operates from 9-12 on THURSDAY. STEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) operates on THURSDAY from 9am to 245 pm. \nInquiry, collaboration, and an emphasis on process-based learning are at the heart of the STEAM approach. Each term the classes will have a focus which drives the learning and our amazing teachers create opportunities to help each student develop their understanding, improve their skills and gain knowledge in a range of topics.\nStudents who participate in STEAM learning:\n\u00b7 think outside the box\n\u00b7 feel safe to express innovative and creative ideas\n\u00b7 feel comfortable doing hands-on learning\n\u00b7 take ownership over their learning\n\u00b7 work collaboratively with others\n\u00b7 understand the ways that science, maths, the arts, and technology work together\n\u00b7 become increasingly curious about the world around them and feel empowered to change it for the better.\nWhen does it meet, and where?\nThe school is held during school terms.\nSTEAMS Jr (ages 7-9) TUESDAY, 9-245.\nSTEAMS Sr (ages 10-13) THURSDAY, 9-245\nLittle STEAMerS (ages 5-6) THURSDAY 12-3.\nLocation:  Waterlea Racecourse, enter off of Linton St.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe students come for a paid three-week trial-as a new student you pay for that through Humanitix.\nIf both family and teacher feel there is a good fit for the child in the class, they continue for the rest of the term. You are then invoiced for the full term less the amount paid for the Trial.\nPayment is by term, with a cost of $73 incl. GST We have a limited number of scholarships available that are awarded on a term by term basis for those with financial need for 25% off. \nLittle STEAMerS is $30 incl. GST.\nWill my child\u2019s school mind that they miss a day per week?\nYou will need to inform the child\u2019s school that he or she will be at STEAMS School one day per week. To date we have not encountered any issues around accommodating a child\u2019s participation in STEAMS School, and many of the region\u2019s schools are very supportive of the programme. Once enrolled, you are encouraged to inform the teacher and office staff that your child should be marked present for the day they attend STEAMS School, as they will be attending an academic school as opposed to being absent due to illness or other reasons.",

This tour marks the first chance for fans to hear the new songs live.\nExploding onto the scene in 2003 with their now-classic debut Permission To Land, The Darkness quickly became one of the UK\u2019s most beloved rock bands, racking up over 1.5 million album sales, a headline set at Reading & Leeds in 2004, and a string of major awards including BRITs, Kerrang!, and an Ivor Novell.\nThe band\u2019s cheeky, spandex-clad anthems changed the face of British rock and continue to capture hearts and a new generation of fans around the world. Their live shows are pure spectacle: soaring falsettos, outrageous outfits, endless guitar solos, and crowds belting out every word. Don\u2019t miss your chance to experience it all live in 2026 - it\u2019s bold, loud, and gloriously over-the-top fun.\nJoining The Darkness on their Australia & New Zealand tour is emerging Australian artist RAGEFLOWER \u2013 a magnetic force of cinematic alt-rock whose sound blurs the boundaries of emotion, experimentation and raw power. Her music balances fragility and strength in equal measure. Her live performances are powerful and deeply felt \u2013 part confessional, part spectacle \u2013 earning her a rapidly growing international audience across the U.S., Japan and Europe, and positioning her as one of Australia\u2019s most compelling new voices.",

What actually IS a spoon, really? Does a spork count? Ponder these deep questions and more as Fumble the Clown explores the infinite comedic potential of cutlery.\n\nIt is unclear where the clown got so many of these metal wonders, or for what purpose. But with a fool\u2019s brain, a dancer\u2019s body and a determination usually reserved only for the truly idiotic, this charming clown will joke, dance, juggle (badly), sing and invite their audience to join the show, creating an unforgettable hour of ridiculous comedy.\n\nSpoon Show is the sophomore solo work created by award-winning Aotearoa-based dancer-turned-clown Daniel Nodder, whose work has been described as a \u201ctour-de-force\u201d, \u201cbeyond human\u201d and \u201cpure artistry\u201d. After developing this new work at \u00c9cole Philippe Gaulier, Daniel brings all of their absurdist comedy and multi-award-winning movement skills to this performance. Performing alongside quirky sound design & composition by Ben Kelly and clever technical design by Rebekah de Roo, this production is a perfectly balanced spoonful of comedy soup.\n\nBe delighted by the simple stupidity and ironic inventiveness of a show about spoons.\n\nPrevious awards won by Daniel Nodder:\nWINNER: Outstanding Performance Award - Dunedin Fringe 2025 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Dance / Physical Theatre Award - Dunedin Fringe 2025 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Artist's Pick Award - San Diego International Fringe 2024 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Outside the Box Award - San Diego International Fringe 2024 (Only Bones)\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance - New Zealand Fringe 2023 (Only Bones)\nNOMINATED: Best in Fringe - New Zealand Fringe 2023 & 2025 (Only Bones; Entry: Encounter)\nNOMINATED: Performer of the Year - Wellington Theatre Awards 2023 (Only Bones)\n\n",

    "long_description": "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention initially developed for emotional disorders. It is now widely used in supporting people to deal with the challenges of physical ill-health. Professionals from various backgrounds can learn to use a simplified CBT skills set, and use of these skills enables them to be more effective in managing aspects of their patients\u2019 distress.\nThe training is a mix of theory, skills demonstration and skills practice, giving participants a better understanding of the applicability of the skill set in their area of practice and providing some skills to take away. Training sessions are spaced to allow participants to use their new skills in their clinical practice. Each participant reflects on their learning and their work with a specific patient, and the whole group reflects on lessons learned. In this way, learning remains rooted in participants\u2019 clinical practice. These CBT courses are consistently evaluated highly by participants.\nThe Course\nTeaching will be commenced with 2 days of in person sessions. 19th and 20th Feb 2026 at Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington and subsequently 2 sessions on-line via Zoom. These will be either 18th or 19th March an 22nd or 23rd April 2026.\nAttendance at all sessions is mandatory to complete the course.\nThe courses cost is $850 per person (incl GST).\nThe Trainers\nKathy Burn was a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Palliative Care who went on to train in CBT and to develop the CBT service at St Christopher\u2019s Hospice, London. She now works in CBT in chronic pain, and she teaches and supervises CBT trainees at the institute of Psychiatry, London.\nKathryn Mannix was a Palliative Medicine Consultant and CBT therapist. She developed \u2018CBT First Aid\u2019 to enable palliative care clinicians to adapt skills from CBT into their clinical practice. She is an author. There are insights into her use of CBT in her books With the End in Mind and Listen.\nTerms and Conditions\nAttendance: In order to create a learning community for each course, it is important that each person on a course attends every session and is able to join in the discussions by keeping up with the course. By accepting a place on a particular course, you agree to attend all the sessions, to arrive on time, and to work alongside your group members during the session to support each other's learning. Each session builds on the last, and you'll be asked to put your new learning into practice in- between sessions. Building learning groups in this way means we can't add new trainees after a course has begun.\nWe are not able to run catch-up sessions for sessions missed. If you miss sessions, you may be asked to withdraw from the course and no refunds will be given.\nRefunds/Canellations: Once you sign up and pay, we won't be able to refund your payment unless we can reallocate your place to another person before the course begins. The deadline for cancelling your place is 28 days before the day and time of the first session. If you cancel and we can fill your place with another person, we'll offer you the choice of a refund or a place on a future course, if places are available. We will do our best to fill your place, but we can't promise this. Refunds will incur an administration fee.\nDates and Times of Sessions: all dates and times are given in NZ time, and this varies over the year. It is up to you to check the correct time in your time zone: you may find this website useful to check your own time zone with Auckland NZ time on each specific date: https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/\nTrainers: we have a team of trainers, all of whom are experienced CBT therapists and trainers, and all are familiar with applying CBT in physical health settings. Different sessions may be taught by different trainers, or by 'guest appearances' by some of our team. The team of trainers will ensure there is continuity of content and of learning as the course progresses.\nSpecial circumstances: Sometimes, life events appear unexpectedly. If something unexpected prevents you from attending, please let us know as early as you can, and we will give consideration to how we might be able to support you to continue your training if that is what you wish to do.",

    "long_description": "[OFFSITE] Jim White (Aus) & Marisa Anderson (US) with Motte + UMU\nOffsite at Meow, 9 Edward Street, Wellington\n\nJim White & Marisa Anderson\nThe collaboration between renowned drummer Jim White (Dirty Three, PJ Harvey, Bonnie Prince Billy, Cat Power) and acclaimed US guitarist Marisa Anderson is a natural union of two of the most intuitive players and listeners working in music. White and Anderson are both in high demand as collaborators, in no small part because of their mastery, versatility and highly expressive playing. The duo have amassed an impressive body of work together (including their 2020 debut The Quickening and 2024\u2019s Swallowtail), and each remain at the vanguard of their practices due to an insatiable curiosity and delight in exploration of new avenues of expression.\n\n---\n\nMarisa Anderson channels the history of the guitar and stretches the boundaries of tradition. Her playing is fluid, emotional, and masterful, featuring compositions and improvisations that re-imagine the landscape of American music. Her work applies elements of minimalism, electronic music, drone and 20th century classical music to compositions based on blues, jazz, gospel and country music.\n\n---\n\nDrummer Jim White first come to attention in the mid-1990s with the acclaimed Australian instrumental trio Dirty Three, and is now recognised internationally as one of the most creative and expressive drummers on the planet. His unique playing style and deft way with sound and rhythm has seen him become the go-to drummer for a huge number of alt-A-list vocalists with collaboration in mind. PJ Harvey has said there is ballet in White\u2019s light, precise touch. And the other collaborators that he\u2019s mesmerised, including the likes of Bonnie Prince Billy, Smog, Nick Cave, White Magic, Beth Orton, Marianne Faithfull, Kurt Vile, Cat Power and the iconic Cretan lyra player Psarantonis, all know that there\u2019s more to White\u2019s drumming than mere accompaniment. His intuitive beats and singular approach have created sparks in his collaborations. Whoever White is playing with, he is right there, present in the most inspirational sense.\n\n---\n\nMotte is the solo project of violinist and composer, Anita Clark. Riding the thin line between beauty and devastation, Motte weaves together a richly textured world with a violin, delay pedal, sampled sound and voice. Creating a world solely her own, the sound is modern classical, ambient, alt/experimental pop and improvised noise. Her musical gifts and skilful reach across genres makes her an indispensable collaborator with The Phoenix Foundation, Luke Buda, Marlon Williams, Don McGlashan, the Renderers, Nadia Reid, Lawrence Arabia, Delaney Davidson and plenty of others. As Motte, she dances around the shining candescence of her culture like a night insect, always seeking a better vantage point to the light.\n\n---\n\nUMU is a duo of Riki Gooch and Daniel Beban. Silver Apples meets Kuduro with Riki's deep grooves played on an 80s Roland electronic drum kit which are manipulated and dubbed out by Dan on two Tama Techstar drum synths.\n\n$35 earlybird tickets via Meow / $20 unwaged\n\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme\n\n",

    "long_description": "USUI REIKI LEVEL TWO IN KAPITI with Heartsong\nLevel Two Usui Reiki is a significant development on from Level One. Get in touch to enquire. You can study Level Two with me if you had your Level One attunement elsewhere.\n\nThis TWO DAY course offers 10 hours of in person training, a full manual, certificate of completion, a follow up Zoom call and ongoing support. Maximum of 6 participants to enable close support and interaction.\n\nLevel 2 involves a new powerful attunement and learning new techniques such as Distance Reiki, sacred reiki symbols, and preparing for working on people you may not know. You can start charging for your Reiki services after completing level two.\n\nWe learn about three Reiki symbols and practice drawing them. By Day 2 it is expected that you have memorized how to draw Level 2 Symbols (I teach with a gap between day 1&2 so this is very achievable).\n\nBecoming competent at distance healing is a significant priority of Level 2 training and we will have plenty of practice doing this. Distance healing is practiced on people and animals. Basic business set up is discussed.\n\nAdvanced Practitioner Level Reiki is a great tool if you want to feel centered in your life, it helps to balance and align our energy bodies, and can cause positive changes in many areas of our lives. Reiki can be used to help heal a wide number of conditions and to initiate and support positive life changes. Further details on enquiry. Reiki Level 2 opens you to a deeper channel of healing energy and enables you to offer healing professionally.\n\nDates are specially chosen to be auspicious in relation to the moon and cosmic energies\n\nSaturday FEBRUARY 21ST, 10.am-4.30pm\n\nSaturday MARCH 14TH, 10am-4.30pm\n\nThe gap in between the two training days allows you to receive support as you experience the 21 day 'cleanse' and integration period after the Reiki attunement - and also enable time to work on developing and practicing the material learnt in the first days training.\n\nTotal of 12 hours tuition time plus some at home practice/study required.\n\nLight simple shared lunches are provided - you will need to bring a contribution.\n\nHerbal teas and light snacks are also provided.\n\nLocation: Paraparaumu Memorial Hall, Corner of Aorangi and Tutanekai Streets, Paraparaumu\n\nPre-enrollment questionnaire -\n\nInvestment:\n\n\u00a3555 for full TWO day course, training, all support materials including manual, certificate, light healthy lunch, refreshments and ongoing support. Plus extra hours online in follow up Zoom call on 21st day.\n\nPay in Full Here - https://buy.stripe.com/9B628q2W4ahTghqdcKew81V\n\nA non-refundable $155 deposit secures your place - book here: https://buy.stripe.com/eVqcN4bsA89LaX6b4Cew81S\n\nThere is a payment plan available - contact me\n\nBryony is a Usui Reiki Master Teacher and she has 27 years healing experience. She loves teaching this precious, versatile healing skill and it gives her great pleasure to offer this training in Lancaster\n\nBryony says:\nReiki has had a powerful positive influence on my life, helping me to heal and change mindset, physical and emotional conditions, and to see life in a new light. Reiki helped with my recovery from Chronic Fatigue syndrome and Depression \u2764 I will share this with you in this course and help you open your life to the positive transformation that Reiki can bring.\n\nIf you are interested in coming on this course, please contact me by email at to receive a questionnaire to answer which gives me a sense of your interest, previous experience of Reiki healing and conditions I should be aware of.\n\nCancellation Policy:\n\nIf Heartsong Healing needs to cancel the course all payments are refunded. If you withdraw from the course before 14 days before start date, your payment will be refunded minus the 55 deposit, kept as an admin fee. If you withdraw within 14 -7 days 50% of your payment will be refunded, 7-3 days 75% of your payment will be refunded, 3 days no refund.

A particular focus will be how complexity science has evolved and how it is informing contemporary actions and solutions for prosperous, resilient, equitable and democratic societies \u2013 amid growing global challenges.\nThe symposium will explore complexity through a rich interdisciplinary lens, bringing together philosophical and epistemological perspectives alongside practical insights from fields including artificial intelligence, infrastructure, health, education, climate, and the environment, and cutting-edge insights from M\u0101ori and local communities.

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

Run by mums, for mums, we support and connect women facing the changes and challenges of being a mum through discussion groups. We also consider the impact motherhood has on other aspects of life, including relationships, career and sense of wellbeing.\nIncluded in your workshop\nYou will be guided by Lara Phillips, a trained creative facilitator in Interactive Drawing Therapy, through drawing prompts (similar to a guided meditation or journaling) to draw out where you are at and draw out your own inner guidance. No art skills are needed, more simple mark making.\nThis gentle yet powerful tool uses drawing and writing as a way to access your subconscious and to listen to your heart rather than your head for guidance. A tool often used in therapy, it is made accessible for self-care and community wellness through these fun and friendly workshops.\nAbout Lara Phillips\nLara Phillips is a creative facilitator trained in Interactive Drawing Therapy. With a 20 year career in creative copywriting in design and communication, she shares drawing and writing as a way of wellness and self-care, to promote preventative and proactive mental health measures through creativity.\n\u201cWe all have the wisdom within to help ourselves, if given the space.\u201d\nFor more workshops or to book individual sessions visit www.drawitout.co.nz.\nLiability disclaimer\nDraw It Out offers creativity for wellbeing. It is not intended as therapy nor does it replace counselling, therapy, or any other medical or clinical professional help.

    "long_description": "\"Faster and faster. And for a long time you wouldn't feel anything. And then you'd burst into fire\" - Laura Palmer\nTWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME.\nDAVID LYNCH | USA & FRANCE | 1992 | 135mins | R18+| 4K DCP PROVIDED BY JANUS FILMS DISTRIBUTION\nJoin us for this very special community fundraiser screening of the prequel to the critically acclaimed series, \"Twin Peaks\".\nABC cancelled the original series after season 2 but a month later, Lynch announced he was \"not yet finished with the material\" and principal photography for the full length prequel film, began on September 5th 1991 at a caravan site in Snoqualmie Washington. Which became the \"Fat Trout Trailer Park\" where the story of the last 7 days of Laura Palmer begins.\nSince its showing at the 1992 Festival De Cannes, no other Lynch film had polarized audiences to such an extent. Fans that wanted more \"Cherry Pie\" and \"Donuts\" from the TV show were served a much darker, unflinching and unforgiving work - in Lynch's own words, a movie about \"the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim\". Derided by critics and many fans at the time it was a commercial box office flop.\nYet in the years since the initial reaction, a gradual wave of reappraisal and appreciation began. With time it's brilliance came into focus with growing acknowledgment, that the film is a more accurate, complex and powerful account of trauma. Combining the dramatic ferocity of Sherly Lee's tour de force and the beauty of Angelo Badalamenti's score, Lynch reclaimed full ownership of the material creating a harrowing, compassionate and enigmatic hymn to Laura Palmer.\nAs we approach the films 34 year anniversary and since Lynch's passing in 2025, it is now regarded by critics and fans worldwide, as a revered epilogue, essential predecessor to \"The Return\", and Lynch's most chilling, terrifying, and yet empathetic and humane cinematic masterpiece.\nWHERE: The Roxy Cinema. 5 Park Road. Miramar. Wellington.\nCinema 1 - The big cinema upstairs with the massive screen, red italian leather sofas, and of course those red curtains!\nWHEN: Wed 25th Feb 2026.

We'll close the day in the galleries, with a performance of photographer Ann Shelton\u2019s work The physical garden.\nOpen to photographers, curators, researchers, students, and anyone with an interest in photography, this event invites participants to connect, reflect, and share.\nTickets $60 (waged) / $40 (unwaged) with lunch included.\nAssisted listening\nAn assisted listening system is available for this event.

Before we\u2019re even conscious of it, we label, compartmentalise or judge - and it can be a real struggle to relish our own bodies when this judgment happens in front of a mirror. \nThe Stories of Our Bodies is an affirming and liberating circle, firmly\nheld in dignity, that redirects this judgement towards positive body image and bodily autonomy. This workshop builds on the living lineage of Australian Radical Faerie elder Uncle Teacosy. It is shaped from gay men\u2019s survival of the 90\u2019s AIDS epidemic, evolved to uplift queer&trans communities and has been offered internationally by only one facilitator.\nEach participant is invited into deep connection with their body and then in turn, we share the stories of our bodies from birth til now, removing as many articles of clothing as we choose. Stories often include histories of illness, injury, gender affirmation, addiction, aging, intentional modification, shape, ability or size\nWhat stories can the marks and folds of a body tell when witnessed in belonging and respect? How can we uplift each story and every storyteller?\nThis circle is for participants from the Takat\u0101pui, MVPFAFF+, LGBTQIA+ communities, active in engaged consent and includes partial or full nudity in a non-sexual atmosphere.\nYour Facilitators: Eleven Greenstones and val smith\nEleven Greenstones (she/they, Pakeha) is a cultural worker, community educator, researcher, gardener and facilitator who seeks deep and fertile justice by cultivating rich soil and robust, adaptive communities. For three decades, Eleven has informed and performed behind a radio desk, on stage, in community centres and cultural hubs. Her work spans the Pacific Ocean including in Aotearoa, Australia, Timor Leste, China, Korea, Mongolia and the US: educating in high schools, AOD rehabs, hospitals, police stations, co-housing cooperatives, squatted warehouses, international language schools and mentoring in arts workshops and community gardens.\nEleven is a life-long student, recently in decolonial Fieldwork with Leah Manaema Avene and with H\u00e9ctor Aristiz\u00e1bal, founder of ImaginAction. They\u2019ve studied post-activism with fugitive philosopher Bayo Akomolafe, Generative Somatics and Undoing Racism\u00ae (People\u2019s Institute for Survival and Beyond). They\u2019ve been mentored by First Nations ecologists to work for a living planet, Undoing White Supremacy Austin (Texas) to design and deliver anti-racism \u2018unlearning circles\u2019 and by Radial Faerie elders to facilitate liberating spaces for the LGBTQIA+ community.\nval smith (P\u0101keh\u0101, they/them) is a choreographic artist-researcher and educator based in T\u0101maki Makaurau, Aotearoa. Their practice engages critical somatics and friendship-based collaboration to explore the socio-political dimensions of whiteness, queerness, and transness within the cultural context of Aotearoa. Recent performance work investigates more-than-human kinship, queer intimacies, and temporalities in relationship with marginal urban places.\nval\u2019s teaching and facilitation engages with community, secondary and tertiary learning environments. They have a Postgraduate Diploma in Dance and Drama Secondary Teaching, and have worked with kids, young people with disabilities, the Disability dance sector, older folks, as well as queer and trans communities. They teach somatic practices, improvisation, performance skills, critical dance, yoga, creative practice and research methodologies.\nA recipient of the Arts Foundation Laureate Award (2019), val was also the 2016 Caroline Plummer Fellow at Te Whare W\u0101nanga o \u014ct\u0101kou, University of Otago, where they undertook a community dance project with the local queer community.",

    "long_description": "This summer, Eastbourne\u2019s prize-winning Butterfly Creek Theatre Troupe proudly celebrates its 30th year of Shakespeare with a strikingly contemporary production of King Lear. In this two-hour adaptation the tragedy is sharpened to its core: the fraught family dynamics of Lear and Gloucester, two parents whose misguided choices unleash betrayal and heartbreak. Lear\u2019s reckless division of his kingdom and Gloucester\u2019s misplaced trust in her children reveal how pride and blindness can devastate generations. Performed as the sun sets on a summer evening\u2014with the adjacent school hall ready should the weather turn\u2014this production offers a fresh perspective on parental folly, loyalty, and love, making Shakespeare\u2019s timeless themes resonate anew.\nThe show will be presented to a seated audience in the school courtyard. It can get chilly so wrap warmly but it will move indoors in poor weather. There is a bar (cash or Eftpos). Parking in the school grounds accessible from Oroua Street.\nWarning: The play contains graphic violence.",

    "long_description": "INTRODUCING AOTEAROA'S NEWEST FUNDRAISING EVENT: RETHINK\nRETHINK Fundraising 2026 invites you and your team to look at your fundraising programme from a fresh perspective.\nJoin us for a full day of inspirational talks, panel discussions and practical workshops that will leave you energised, AND armed with a toolkit of actionable learnings to take your fundraising to the next level.\nDate: Thursday, 5 March\nVenue: M\u0101karo Room, Wharewaka Function Centre\nTime: 8am-5pm\nCost: $249NZD (exc GST)*\nContact: Anna Shere anna@changeand.co\n*If you prefer to pay via invoice, please email accounts@changeand.co.\nTHE PROGRAM\nFor those of you who joined us for RETHINK Auckland 2025, please note that RETHINK Wellington will feature many of the same sessions from that event, with a few additions to the program and two new guest speakers.\nBranding blindspots \nIn a sector focused on campaigns, conversion, and compliance, brand is often overlooked. But brand isn\u2019t just a logo or a nice story. It\u2019s how people feel about supporting you. And if it's not clear, engaging, or modern \u2013 you\u2019re leaving both money and meaning on the table. This presentation from Tim Dove at re:brand will challenge a few norms and show some examples of it being done well. He\u2019ll get you thinking about your organisation and how you can ensure you\u2019re avoiding the \u2018brand blindspot\u2019. \nRethinking charity comms \nWhen it comes to getting people enthused about our cause, too often we focus on the what rather than the why. Worse, we risk boring our audience to death with earnest, organisation-centric communications which neither inspire nor instruct. Dominique Antarakis from Change&Co will show you a new and fun way to look at your charity comms for maximum engagement and donor retention.  \nWorkshop 1 \nFacilitated workshop which will provide the opportunity to take the learnings from the morning sessions and give you the practical branding and comms tools to take back to your organisation - and transform your fundraising! \nLunch break  \nTake a break, mix and mingle, and enjoy a fabulous lunch selection.\nData, behaviour, and hyper-personalisation \nThis presentation from MIMO/DATAM will show you how to transform raw data into meaningful, multi-channel interactions across email, SMS, voice, and direct mail - all from a single platform. This session will challenge how you think about personalisation - it\u2019s not just about names in subject lines or open rates in eDMs, it\u2019s about burning down the old school campaigns and rebuilding around behaviour, context and connection. \nLessons from the legacy frontlines \nBased on interviews with practitioners from organisations large and small, this session shares unfiltered insights from Gift in Will managers who are doing the work every day\u2014what's actually generating pledges, where they're getting stuck, and what they wish they'd known sooner. Through their collective wisdom, and guided by TEDIREX\u2019s Martin Ruane, we'll explore the biggest challenges facing legacy programs today, the opportunities hiding in plain sight, and tactical takeaways that work for both beginners and experienced practitioners. \nWorkshop 2 \nFacilitated workshop which will provide the opportunity to take the learnings from the afternoon sessions and give you the practical personalisation and AI tools to ramp up acquisition and retention.  \nCFRE ACCREDITATION\nFull participation in RETHINK Fundraising is applicable for 7 points in Category 1.B -Education of the CFRE International application for initial certification and/or recertification.\nEVENT PARTNERS\nChange&Co, DATAM, mimo, re:brand and Tedirex. Special thanks to FIA/FINZ for their support of the day.\nRETHINK has been designed by fundraisers for fundraisers, and we\u2019re keen to make sure you get the most out of the day. We promise no hard-sell, no product placement, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee.\nThe idea is for you to leave at the end of the day with a roadmap to greater donor engagement \u2013 and a sense of renewed energy for what lies ahead.",

    "long_description": "The Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra (AoJO) returns to Wellington with a contemporary re-imagining of one of the most influential works of the 20th century: George Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue. The performance takes place at Meow Nui on Thursday 6 March at 7.00pm, featuring acclaimed pianist Ben Wilcock.\n\nFirst heard in 1924, Rhapsody in Blue broke new ground by fusing jazz language with symphonic form. In this performance, AoJO honours the essence of Gershwin\u2019s original while re-examining the work through a modern big band lens \u2014 expanding its orchestral colours, rhythmic drive, and improvisational possibilities for today\u2019s audiences.\n\nAoJO Musical Director John Rae says the orchestra approached the piece with both respect and curiosity:\n\n\u201cGershwin was writing music that looked forward, not backward. Our aim with this version of Rhapsody in Blue is to treat it the same way, to honour the original while allowing it to speak in a contemporary jazz language that feels alive right now.\u201d\n\nThe performance features pianist Ben Wilcock, widely regarded as one of Aotearoa\u2019s leading jazz artists, whose international career spans Europe, the UK, and New Zealand.\n\n\u201cBen brings an incredible combination of authority, imagination, and openness to this music,\u201d says Rae. \u201cHe understands Gershwin from the inside out, and he\u2019s not afraid to take risks, which is exactly what this piece demands.\u201d\n\nWilcock has been praised internationally for his distinctive musical voice: \u201cWilcock combines dazzling technical command with a rare sense of musical narrative \u2014 his playing is both fearless and deeply expressive.\u201d \u2014 All About Jazz\n\nAnother review described him as \u201cA pianist of remarkable clarity and imagination, equally at home in classical repertoire and cutting-edge jazz.\u201d\n\nAlongside this project, AoJO continues its broader mission of developing large-ensemble jazz in Aotearoa and creating meaningful performance opportunities for local musicians.\n\n\u201cThe Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra exists to celebrate, develop, and present contemporary large-ensemble jazz in Aotearoa \u2014 supporting our musicians, engaging new audiences, and placing this music in a living cultural context rather than a museum one.\u201d\n\nEvent details\nWhat: Aotearoa Jazz Orchestra: Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue\nFeaturing: Ben Wilcock (piano)\nWhere: Meow Nui, Wellington\nWhen: Friday 6 March 2026, 7.00pm",

It took a while for me to become comfortable with it, but The Folksinger Show became my staple.\n\n\"And then, somehow or other, twenty-five years were gone, and now I find myself approaching the end of my career, and wanting to be seen more as just a singer, who wrote a body of work, very little of which one would reasonably label \u2018folk\u2019. So I\u2019m back with my Telecaster, my Princeton amp, and my solo show is now electric.\u201d\n\n",

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

He will also make a solo appearance at Te Ahurei Toi o T\u0101maki Auckland Arts Festival, where he joins He Manu T\u012boriori, a celebration of waiata reo M\u0101ori, on Saturday 21 March.\nAt the centre of Amber Skies is Muroki\u2019s drive for freedom and new experiences. He believes music only really happens when he is fully living, pushing into new environments, meeting people and adding what he calls seasoning to life. \nThe album was written and recorded between Aotearoa and Berlin, with production by Djeisan Suskov, Justyn Pilbrow and Josh Fountain, and featuring Len Blake and keyboard virtuoso Joe Kaptein. \nMuroki is immersed in the Berlin scene, regularly jamming with musicians including members of Parcels, Rikas and the Zen Men, finding grounding in a city that can be both electric and mellow. He filmed the video for latest single Break It Down in Portugal with director Ezra Simons (Earth Tongue), shot entirely on 16mm film in Peniche and Nazar\u00e9, and also returned to Kenya for the first time since he was sixteen, reconnecting with wh\u0101nau and gaining perspective during this chapter.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been bouncing between places while working on this album. Living nomadically keeps me open and curious. Nothing beats coming back to Aotearoa, and I can\u2019t wait to play these songs live with the band.\u201d\nWith platinum success on Wavy, the Triple J topping Love Cocoon with BENEE and collaborations with LEISURE, Young Franco and NASAYA, Muroki returns home ready to take these songs to the stage.",

Voices New Zealand debuted with a concert at the same festival in 1998. It has gone on to build a reputation for excellence in the music world. For this celebratory concert, the choir is joined by taonga p\u016boro artist Horomona Horo, leading instrumentalists, and a chamber ensemble from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. \nThe concert centrepiece is Robert Wiremu\u2019s Re-imagined Mozart: Erebus. The programme also features a new commission from Takerei Komene, as well as waiata by Ng\u0101p\u014d and Pimia Wehi. This highlights Dr Grylls\u2019 pioneering collaborations that reshaped Aotearoa\u2019s choral landscape. Her expertise as a choral clinician is sought internationally, and she regularly conducts masterclasses and workshops in Wales, England, North America, Canada and Australia. \nThis marks Dr Grylls\u2019 final appearance as Music Director of Voices New Zealand.

Often compared to Billy Bragg, she writes songs that rally, comfort and cut straight to the bone, tackling themes of feminism, queer identity and social justice with passion and bite. \nSince touring New Zealand in 2020 with The Guilty Feminist, Grace has won a loyal following here, drawn to both her firebrand politics and her disarming charm. Her breakout single Black Tie became a queer anthem, streaming over 1.2 million times and drawing praise from MOJO, The Observer and The New Yorker.\nHer latest album Build Something Better, produced by Frank Turner, topped the UK folk charts and confirmed what fans already knew: Grace Petrie is one of Britain\u2019s most vital, uncompromising and entertaining songwriters.",

This celebration of gender diversity in ECE will be held in a safe and supportive environment and is a fantastic opportunity to meet others in the profession, share your own story, and be inspired.\nGender Steretoypes in ECE - Mike Collin and Max Christie\nWhat can gender stereotypes teach us about teaching and learning?\nEarly childhood education relies on diversity within teaching teams. Yet, gender stereotypes often shape how we see ourselves and each other as kaiako. This interactive session invites educators to explore the hidden assumptions that influence teaching roles and team dynamics. In this session, Max and Mike will unpack how stereotypes impact collaboration and how every kaiako adds unique value to teaching teams. Participants will leave with practical strategies to challenge bias, strengthen team culture, and celebrate the richness of varied approaches in ECE settings.\nAutism NZ - Thecla Moffat\nMen can change the dynamics of play in ECE benefiting autistic tamariki\nMale kaiako often bring more energy in the ECE setting with an emphasis on more physical activity, outdoor play, \"rough and tumble\" play, and positive risk-taking, which appeals to both boys and girls and provides a different dimension to play than may be beneficial to most autistic tamariki. We now know that through fun and engaging interactions kaiako help enhance the autistic tamariki pivotal capacities for later learning. In this talk kaiako will get to know how men in ECE with their positive energy can make a difference through play for autistic tamariki in their centres. The kaiako will be given a few strategies of how to do that and some ideas to encourage tuakana-teina (peer play) between autistic tamariki and their non-autistic peers will be shared.",

It captures Maltese at his most personal, trading irony for honesty and humour for vulnerability.\n\nMuch like kindred spirits Randy Newman and Father John Misty, beneath Maltese\u2019s sumptuous melodies and classic pop craftsmanship there\u2019s always a lyric that stops you in your tracks \u2013 sometimes breaking your heart, sometimes making you laugh. Across the album\u2019s eleven tracks, Maltese\u2019s trademark wit is still present but wielded with restraint, often emerging through self-deprecation and quiet revelation.\n\nHaving first established himself in 2018 with his debut Bad Contestant, Maltese has since evolved into one of the UK\u2019s finest young songwriters. The albums that followed cemented his reputation for transforming the mundane into something dream-like, his piano harmonies, playful lyricism and quintessentially British wit resonating around the world.\n\nIn late 2024, Maltese embarked on a headline tour across Asia, Australia and New Zealand, following sold-out runs through the US, Europe and the UK \u2013 including his biggest performances to date at The Wiltern in Los Angeles and London\u2019s Electric Brixton. With Hers, he now steps into an even bigger chapter: playing to larger rooms than ever before and connecting with an audience that continues to grow from Sydney to S\u00e3o Paulo, Jakarta to Tokyo.\n\nAudiences can expect an enchanting live experience that blends Maltese\u2019s new material with an favourites spanning his six-album catalogue \u2013 poetic, wry, and unashamedly human.\n\n",

    "long_description": "The \u201cMysticssippi Blues Man\u201d and one of Canada\u2019s most revered and distinctive musical voices brings his world-renowned live show to New Zealand audiences!\nHarry Manx has spent decades carving out a singular musical path. He is known for his extraordinary ability to fuse deep blues grooves with the spiritual depth of Indian classical music. Switching effortlessly between slide guitar, harmonica, banjo, and the remarkable Mohan veena \u2014 a 20-stringed instrument taught to him by Indian master Vishwa Mohan Bhatt \u2014 Manx creates performances that are immersive, transportive, and deeply human.\n\u201cA seamless fit between blues and Indian classical music\u201d - DownBeat Magazine\n\u201cDeliciously addictive\" - The New York Times\n\u201cCanada\u2019s most expressive blues player\u201d - Billboard Magazine\n\ud83d\udccd Friday 03 April @ The Little Theatre - Lower Hutt\n7pm doors / 7:30pm show\nSeated Concert\n2 x 45 minute sets with intermission\n$59 Early Bird Tickets (very limited)\nDON'T miss your chance to see live music at it's finest!\n\n\u201cWatching Harry play tonight I feel like I learned something new \u2026. \u201d\nBruce Springsteen\nHarry Manx is an artist that critics have occasionally had a hard time getting their minds around. His unique amalgam of blues and other American roots music, classical Indian forms, and bits of rock, pop, and folk makes him difficult to pigeonhole, and self-appointed gatekeepers of those traditions sometimes bemoan his lack of purity, stubbornly missing the point. But Manx\u2019s trip is really quite easy to grasp: He\u2019s an accomplished and adventurous lap-slide guitarist \u2013 whether playing a National resonator, a solidbody lap-steel, a modified banjo or cigar-box guitar, or his signature 20-string Mohan Veena \u2013 and a compelling singer with a rich, warm, and soulful voice who writes intelligent and compassionate songs and puts them over with heartfelt conviction.\u201d\nBarry Cleveland, Guitar Player Magazine\n\nThere are concerts, and then there are rare musical gatherings that feel quietly profound. Harry Manx creates the latter. This is music that doesn\u2019t rush, doesn\u2019t shout, and doesn\u2019t rely on spectacle \u2014 instead, it invites you to listen deeply, feel fully, and leave changed. Audiences don\u2019t just attend a Harry Manx show; they experience it. These nights linger long after the final note fades, becoming the kind of concert people talk about for years. If you value artistry, atmosphere, and the rare magic that happens when a room truly listens, this is a performance you\u2019ll want to be part of.",

Not only will you get the full album, but there will also be other much-loved favourites. Hear A Pair of Brown Eyes, Dirty Old Town, A Rainy Night in Soho, and plenty more. \nHelping bring this re-creation to life are original members James Fearnley, Jem Finer and Spider Stacy. There is also a special lineup of acclaimed guest vocalists, Daragh Lynch, Iona Zajac, and John Francis Flynn. Together they\u2019ll present a soul-stirring celebration of one of modern music\u2019s most enduring legacies. \nThe Pogues formed in 1982 and fused punk with traditional Irish music. They originally called themselves Pogue Mahone. This phrase is an anglicisation of the Irish for p\u00f3g mo th\u00f3in, meaning \u201ckiss my arse\u201d.",

Playing Wellington\u2019s San Fran on Saturday 11 April, followed by The Powerstation in Auckland on Sunday 12 April. \nTickets on sale Thursday 2 October 12pm from helmetmusic.com\nHelmet has built a reputation as one of the most commanding forces in the underground scene.

    "long_description": "She\u2019s a comedian boasting stage, television, and podcast success. Joanne McNally heads to The Opera House in Wellington for a new stage show. Pinotphile displays the Irish comic\u2019s wry wit and sense of the absurd. Hailed by Variety as One to Watch, McNally has been keeping herself busy since her last tour by ruining men\u2019s lives (and her own). For Pinophile, she\u2019s still single, still unfertilised, and laden with irreverent, ridiculous and hilarious war stories. Join Joanne for a wild ride as she navigates situationships, revenge, frenemies and rejection. The Irish Examiner describes her trademark style as \u2018joyously nuts\u2019. \nYou may have come across Joanne as a co-host of the award-winning podcast My Therapist Ghosted Me. She\u2019s also had riotous appearances on Taskmaster, The Jonathan Ross Show and The Big Fat Quiz of Everything.",

    "long_description": "Evening Tour\nWould you like to join us and explore the beauty of Karori Cemetery in the evening?\nThis tour is for anyone who would like to see the Cemetery through a different lens, as the landscape settles in from dusk to darkness. On this walk you'll be accompanied by two guides who will take you on a wander through some of the most magical parts of the cemetery, with a story or two of early Wellingtonians along the route. We might even spy a Ruru/Morepork or two! The tour does not have any scary themes. There are points on the tour where we may pause and turn off our torches to enjoy the landscape in the darkness.\nThe tour is of approximately 1.5 hours duration and starts and finishes at the Main Chapel on Rosehaugh Avenue, where there is plenty of easy parking.\nEach attendee needs to bring their own torch that they can comfortably carry for the duration. No head torches please for the comfort of your fellow walkers.\nThe route mostly follows paved surfaces but there are some areas of unevenness. Surefootedness is required. This tour involves approximately 2km of walking, with some slow paced but uphill stints.\nThe tour is not suited for children under the age of 12 or unaccompanied minors. There are no toilets on the route.\n\nEach tour is $10 per person (plus non-refundable booking fee).\nOur tour has a maximum capacity of about 15 persons. If there are insufficient tickets remaining for your party, please email us at info@friendsofkaroricemetery.co.nz to check if we can accommodate you.\nPlease note:\nIf we have to cancel a tour due to inclement weather or sickness, we will notify you on the day 1 hour before the tour starts by email and on our Facebook page. The booking fee is non-refundable.\nPlease dress appropriately for the conditions. While we do our best to guide you on a safe walking route, the ground can become slippery in places.\nSome of our walks require a moderate degree of fitness and are not suited for those with limited mobility.\nIf you have purchased tickets for other people can you please pass our tour information on to them as well.\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Karori Cemetery.",

    "long_description": "Mozart Requiem\nExperience two masterpieces in one exceptional concert as Orpheus Choir Wellington present Christopher Tin\u2019s To Shiver the Sky alongside Mozart\u2019s Requiem. This concert spans five centuries of imagination and purpose, from the earliest dreams of flight to one of the greatest choral masterpieces ever written.\n\nTo Shiver the Sky is an epic choral spectacular from Grammy winning composer Christopher Tin. Drawing on texts from da Vinci, Hildegard von Bingen, Ovid, Jules Verne, Amelia Earhart and John F. Kennedy, it builds a sweeping musical history of human flight from imagined wings to the Moon landing. Born from a record breaking Kickstarter campaign, the work opens with Sogno di Volare, known worldwide as the main theme of Civilization VI, one of the most celebrated strategy games of the decade. Its sound world spans luminous stillness and immense choral climaxes, evoking the exhilaration and peril of human flight.\n\nMozart\u2019s Requiem stands as one of the greatest choral works ever composed. Written in the final months of his life, it sets the sacred Requiem Mass with blazing dramatic power and a depth of feeling that has captivated audiences for more than two centuries. From the fierce energy of the Dies Irae to the aching beauty of the Lacrimosa, the music moves with a haunting power that remains unmatched in the choral repertoire.\n\nTogether these works form an extraordinary musical journey. One celebrates the daring that pushes humanity forward. The other reveals the full dramatic power of the Requiem tradition at its most intense and expressive. Performed by the mighty Orpheus Choir Wellington with Orchestra Wellington, conducted by Brent Stewart and featuring celebrated soprano Emma Pearson, this is a night of immense musical colour and emotional impact.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Fat Freddy's Drop: Based On A True Story 21st Anniversary Tour | Sun 3 May | MFC\nDoing it for the love of music, legendary band Fat Freddy's Drop are returning to the stage in 2026 to perform their ground-breaking debut album Based On A True Story.\n\nThe 51 dates across Australia, Aotearoa, Europe & UK will be Freddy\u2019s first shows following the sudden death of founding band member Chris \u2018MU\u2019 Faiumu. The band is united in its decision to continue with this long-planned tour.\n\nLead singer Dallas Tamaira says, \u2018It\u2019s important for us to honour the intentions we had with MU and playing\nthis album live is part of that.\u2019\n\nBased On A True Story was independently released in 2005, an album of 10 fresh slices of future funk, with surprises, fakes & freaky sidesteps. In a historic run, the album became Aotearoa\u2019s Longest-Charting Album with 111 weeks in the Top 40, won eight NZ Music Awards and took out Giles Peterson\u2019s Worldwide Music\nAwards in the UK.\n\n\u2018This was the band\u2019s first full length studio album and its success was the springboard for what has been an incredible journey together\u2019, explains saxophonist Scott Towers. \u2018We want to pay tribute to the music, to MU and the band he established. And, of course, to play to our fans around the world who have supported us through everything.\u2019\n\n",

    "long_description": "John Maus NZ Tour 2026 | WELLINGTON\nBANISHED MUSIC & STRANGE NEWS PRESENT\nJOHN MAUS ~ NEW ZEALAND TOUR 2026\n\nWEDNESDAY 6 MAY - MEOW, WELLINGTON\nTHURSDAY 7 MAY - DOUBLE WHAMMY, AUCKLAND\n\nTickets from Banished Music\n\nThe musical career of John Maus has been riddled with iconic moments. Now, to celebrate the release of his brand new album Later Than You Think, the synth-tastic American songwriter with the unmistakable baritone is headed to New Zealand for two extraordinary shows next May. Brought to you by Banished Music and Strange News, Mr Maus is set to make good on a long-held promise.\n\nIn 2019, after a series of personal tragedies and the stresses of touring his high-intensity show left Maus feeling unable to perform here, he flew home urgently to recover, with shows here cancelled at short notice. Now, with five years of contemplation, retreat and recuperation, and time spent crafting his new record, John Maus is set to make his return.\n\nThroughout his long career, Maus considered himself to have been \u201cconstantly fighting the status quo: the Mickey Mouse Club, Coca-Cola, and all the institutions that reduce culture to its lowest common denominator\u201d. Then, in 2020, he was infamously photographed at the January 6 riots, and was himself promptly \u201ccancelled\u201d.\n\nIn hindsight, he says, he now knows he should have been a lot clearer about his ethos and political beliefs in the wake of it all. \u201cI thought my legacy would speak for itself,\u201d Maus told Stereogum in a recent interview. Stating he was only at the protest to shoot footage for a new documentary film alongside film-maker Alex Moyer, these days he realises he ought to have stated his position a lot more bluntly. \u201cI should have been clearer that I\u2019m absolutely against Trumpism,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as forthright a denunciation as it should have been.\u201d\n\nPowered by \u201cgenuine emotion and radical sincerity\u201d, the new album includes I Hate Antichrist, a song Maus describes as a sort of sequel to Cop Killer, and features a secular Gregorian chant that embraces French philosopher Alain Badiou\u2019s anti-xenophobic sentiment that \u201cAll the people who are here are from here\u201d.\n\nFrom the death of ego and descent into madness, this is a party we\u2019re all invited to.\n\n",

    "long_description": "Day 1 \u2013 May 10, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: Working with Dissociative Parts and Their Voices in Complex Trauma and Dissociative Disorders\nOverview:\nThis seminar focuses on adapting EMDR for individuals with dissociative disorders, using the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) Dolores has developed. It provides strategies for working with dissociative parts and their voices and integrating a trauma-informed approach to inner conflict safely from early treatment stages.\nKey Learning Points:\n\u00b7         Identifying and working with dissociative parts and their voices.\n\u00b7         Understanding the function and purpose of \u201chostile\u201d parts.\n\u00b7         Addressing dissociative phobias through EMDR informed techniques.\n\u00b7         Managing resistance and treatment impasses.\n\u00b7         Structuring work with dissociative parts effectively.\nProgram Description:\nAfter many early cautions about the potential dangers of using EMDR with individuals suffering from dissociative disorders, limited methods have been offered for adapting standard EMDR procedures to this specific population. Based on these early cautions, EMDR is still considered by many clinicians as limited to the treatment of traumatic memories in high-functioning dissociative clients and only after a long preparation phase that depends on other treatment modalities. Confined by this conceptualisation, the use of EMDR is too often limited, and many survivors of severe traumatisation are unable to benefit from EMDR reprocessing and, if at all, only much later in the treatment process.\nDolores Mosquera developed (with AnabelGonzalez, M.D.) the Progressive Approach model for treating complex trauma and dissociation (2012) and the Trauma-Informed Relational Approach for Dissociative Parts (TADP) (2019, 2025). Using this trauma and AIP-informed models, clinicians can safely utilise a wide range of EMDR interventions (including BLS) from early in the preparatory phase of treatment for patients with dissociative disorders.\nIn this seminar, she will present her current practice of working with clients, including video demonstrations. Mosquera's deft clinical skills and ground-breaking innovative thinking teach a middle ground between \"dissociation blind\" aggressive EMDR interventions and overly cautious delays to the use of EMDR reprocessing.\nMany dissociative clients have difficulty with hostile, critical voices. The internal conflict is sometimes so intense that the person even has difficulty carrying on an ordinary conversation. One factor that affects this conflict is how the patient deals with the voices or parts of the self.\nKey Program Content:\nIdentify the internal system of dissociation and internal voices that are hostile and critical\nHow to read the function and purpose behind the saboteur parts of self\nUsing compassion and understanding to help deal with dissociative phobias within the internal system\nSkills to reduce impasses and resistance that may complicate or reduce the efficacy of the treatment\nSpecific steps to organize the work with hostile parts and voices\n Days 2\u20133 \u2013 May 11\u201312, 2026 (9:00am\u20134:30pm)\nTopic: From Fragmentation to Integration: A Master Class in Treating Complex Trauma and Dissociation\nFormat: 2-Day Masterclass: Three Clinical Cases from Start to Finish\nAcross two days, Dolores will present three distinct new cases illustrating varying levels of dissociation \u2014 including one with frequent switching and no initial Adult Self. Each session is interactive, highlighting the therapeutic process from assessment to completion.\nOver two immersive days, this advanced master class offers a rare opportunity to observe and analyse complete therapeutic processes under the expert guidance of Dolores Mosquera.\n\nDolores will present three new and distinct clinical cases, each representing different manifestations of complex trauma and dissociation \u2014 including one client who experiences frequent switching and begins therapy without an integrated adult self.\nParticipants will follow these clients\u2019 journeys from the initial stages of therapy through to treatment completion, gaining deep insight into decision-making, pacing, and the integration of EMDR strategies within complex systems. The format is designed to be highly interactive and reflective, combining video demonstrations, live commentary, and group discussion to deepen understanding of safe, flexible, and attuned clinical practice when working with dissociative clients.\nThis master class is ideal for clinicians seeking to refine their skills, expand their conceptual framework, and enhance clinical confidence when navigating the challenges of trauma-related dissociation.\nAdditional Details\n\u00b7         Eligibility: Must have completed at least Part One of EMDR Basic Training (University of Otago or equivalent).\n\u00b7         Certification: Participants receive a Professional Development Certificate of Attendance.\n\u00b7         Dietary needs: Provided upon registration.\n\u00b7         Parking: Paid on-site parking available.\n\u00b7         Accommodation: Discounted rates at a local hotel (discount code to be posted on the event site).",

I came in hoping to gain some valuable insights and tips for better public speaking, but what I received was so much more. I developed a newfound confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, learned how to captivate an audience, and discovered strategies for managing nerves and overcoming stage fright. I would recommend this effective speaking course to anyone looking to enhance their communication abilities. It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation\n\"By far the best course i have attended in any organisation, either here in NZ or abroad. The format of the course was engaging and there was a great balance between listening, engaging and participating. I look forward to using the skills used presenting at our next Team Hui!\"\nMatthew Townsley, Medical Council of New Zealand\n\n\n\"Really great course, no pressure environment with a good mix of interactive and book work. Have walked away feeling more confident in how I am going to put my presentations together.\"\n\nJessica Stokes, Emergency Management Team, New Plymouth District Council\n\"It was good, practical and useful tools \"not rules\" for business comms and pressos. Good to learn some of the other things you don't often learn in traditional presentation skills training. Really good engagement and interaction - the team were impressed we were all engaged right until the end! Easily one of the best courses I have been on in this line of work. Keep up the good work! \"\nBrad Stansell, Channel Account Manager, Pax 8",

    "long_description": "Meet Getdown Services \u2013 your new favourite band and one of the UK\u2019s hottest word-of-mouth acts! The brilliantly offbeat cult British duo has been turning heads across Britain and Europe with their balls-to-the-walls live shows, tongue-in-cheek wit, razor-sharp lyrics and infectious disco-fuelled grooves, teetering between chaos and genius. And now, after selling out tours across the UK and Europe, they\u2019re bringing their riotous show down under for the first time in May/June 2026 \u2013 with shows in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Wellington, presented by I OH YOU and MG Live. \nTickets go on sale Friday 14 November at 10.00am local time, with MG Live presale commencing Thursday 13 November at 10.00am local time. Sign up for early access to the MG Live presale here.               \n\u201cI reckon we get people asking us to come to Australia probably every day, and everyone in England is moving there, so will be good to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\u201cAlways been one of those places where you\u2019re like, \u2018Fair enough, but I can\u2019t be arsed with that. It looks mad \u2013 there\u2019s snakes and also it takes 40 hours to get there.\u2019 Will be good fun, though! Went to New Zealand to see a mate of ours get married a few years ago and thought it was a lovely country and I really liked those pies they have. It felt quite similar to the UK in a lot of ways, so playing gigs there should be fun!\u201d\nGetdown Services\n\nFor those in the know, Bristol-based duo Josh Law and Ben Sadler \u2013 aka Getdown Services \u2013 are THE must-see new act of the year. And if you don\u2019t know yet, you will soon \u2026 and you\u2019ll wish you got in early! Named as \u201cone to watch\u201d at this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival and dubbed (by the band themselves) \u201cBritain\u2019s Best Band\u201d, their live shows are equal parts smart, sweaty and gloriously unhinged. Their sound is a wild blend of scrappy indie disco, twisted funk and post-punk energy, turning the absurdity of modern Britain into dancefloor gold.        \n \nThe pair met at school in Minehead, Somerset and now make music together at home in Bristol \u2013 churning out what Rolling Stone called \u201cpower disco with unrepentant silliness\u201d with a healthy dose of satire and swagger. Their highly lauded debut album Crisps (Breakfast Records, 2023) showcased their eclectic danceable grooves and biting social commentary, and a mix of sharp, funny social observations wrapped in irresistible, funk-fuelled rhythms. Follow-up EPs Your Medal\u2019s In The Post, Crumbs and latest, Primordial Slot Machine, cemented their cult status, alongside an arsenal of red-hot singles \u2013 including James Bay\u2019s Hat, Dog Dribble, I Got Views and Eat Quiche, Sleep, Repeat.   \n \n \u201cGetdown Services are unrepentantly silly and constantly deliver one of the most joyously deranged live shows \u2013 just one of the best live bands out there!\u201d\n Rolling Stone\n\u201cTheir live show is as daft and as exhilarating as they come. Five stars.\u201d\n Buzz Magazine\n \n \u201cGenuine contenders to being the most exciting and interesting band in the UK right now.\u201d\n CLASH\n\n Getdown Services look set to gobble up the world, one crumb at a time. Whether you\u2019re into danceable chaos, satirical genius or just want to be ahead of the curve, Getdown Services are the band you didn\u2019t know you needed \u2013 until now! Britain\u2019s favourite new band are about to become yours too! \n\nMG LIVE TERMS OF SALE\n\nhttps://mg.live/termsofsale",

Emergence is the latest show by English physicist, presenter, and personality Professor Brian Cox. He takes to the stage at TSB Arena to contemplate the dazzling complexity of the universe and how it\u2019s built on profoundly simple principles. \nEmergence is also a scientific history of 400 years of human discovery. How did we come to understand so much about the cosmos? Guided by mathematics, curiosity, and an aesthetic sense of symmetry, our species has begun to read the story of the Universe. We\u2019ve started to carry our spacecraft to the edge of the solar system and outwards to the stars. Brian\u2019s engaging style makes these questions come to life. The audience will be left awestruck and thrilled as the show covers vast topics in an accessible way. \nBrian has appeared in many landmark science programs for BBC radio and television over the last 15 years, from the Peabody Award-winning Wonders of the Solar System to the worldwide hit series The Planets. His previous touring show, Horizons, was performed to nearly half a million people across the world.",

She is a masterful storyteller who, according to one The New York Times critique, \u201cobserves the world with a clinically poetic eye.\u201d Her song lyrics often focus on city life, ordinary people, and real-world subjects. They are notably succinct, understated, and immediately recognisable.",
    "description": "Widely regarded as one of the foremost songwriters of her generation, Suzanne Vega emerged as a leading figure of the folk revival of the early 1980s.\nFour decades later, she is still writing and singing great songs.\nIn her Wellington show, Suzanne will perform a career-spanning set.\nSee her on stage at St James Theatre performing favourites like Tom\u2019s Diner, Luka, Marlene On The Wall, and plenty more.\nThere\u2019ll also be new songs from her 2025 album, \u2018Flying with Angels\u2019.",

generation, Suzanne Vega emerged as a leading figure of the folk revival of the early 1980s. Accompanying herself on acoustic guitar, Vega sang what has been called contemporary folk or neo-folk songs of her own creation in Greenwich Village clubs. Since the release of her self-titled, critically acclaimed 1985 debut album, she has given sold-out concerts in many of the world\u2019s best-known venues. Known for performances that convey deep emotion, Vega\u2019s distinctive, \u201cclear, unwavering voice\u201d (Rolling Stone) has been described as \u201ca cool, dry sandpaper-brushed near-whisper\u201d by The Washington Post, with NPR Music noting that she \u201chas been making vital, inventive music\u201d throughout the course of her decades-long career. Bearing the stamp of a masterful storyteller who \u201cobserves the world with a clinically poetic eye\u201d (The New York Times), Vega\u2019s songs have tended to focus on city life, ordinary people and real-world subjects. Notably succinct and understated, her work is immediately recognizable\u2014as utterly distinct and thoughtful as it was when her voice was first heard on the radio over 40 years ago.\n\n\n",

    "long_description": "After three years of closure, the newly renovated and strengthened City Gallery Wellington Te Whare Toi will host the art of Cornelia Parker. The English visual artist is best known for her innovative and contemporary sculpture and installation art. Her large-scale, immersive installations explore themes of destruction and reconstruction, transformation and metamorphosis. Objects are exploded, crushed, and suspended in a world upended and remade anew.\nCurated by independent UK-based curator Andrea Schlieker and City Gallery Wellington\u2019s Senior Curator Aaron Lister, City Gallery Wellington's exhibition will encompass Parker\u2019s long career as an artist. This includes an immersive sound and light installation, \u2018Stolen Thunder\u2019. The work gathers the sounds of approaching storms from around the globe and across time. The exhibition will also showcase her paintings, photos, films, and sculptures.\n\u201cI have always said this is the one exhibition I want to do before I die,\u201d said Charlotte Davy, Ringatohu Toi Director Art and City Gallery Wellington. \u201cI have been following Cornelia Parker\u2019s work for the last twenty years. Bringing her mischievous, dark, and literally explosive work to Wellington is incredible.\u201d \nParker\u2019s work often fills entire rooms and invites the viewer to move through and around the art. Given its physical scale, the blank canvas of the reopened gallery offers the perfect opportunity to host the exhibition. The exhibition will kick off in October 2026, carrying through to March 2027. \nCharlotte notes the exhibition\u2019s themes are also of particular relevance to Wellington. \u201cI hope that the exhibition and our return to Te Ng\u0101kau Civic Square will reflect our city and also help remake it. We are looking forward to opening with a bang.\u201d\nHero image: \u00a9 Cornelia Parker. Courtesy of the artist and Frith Street Gallery, London",

    "long_description": "Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",
