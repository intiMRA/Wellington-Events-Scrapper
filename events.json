Picture golden sunsets, flamingos, thatched umbrellas and the carefree buzz of a sun-soaked getaway, right in the heart of Wellington. No passport required.\r\n\r\nThe menu is vibrant and full of escapist flair. Start with coconut prawns and banana blossom kokoda, then dive into mains like mango glazed  pork rib rack or the tropical tofu paneer curry. Save room for dessert: pineapple upside-down pudding or a coconut rum fondue to bring the tropical fantasy to a sweet finale. Behind the bar, the tiki and kava-spiked cocktails flow freely, from Blue Hawaiian\u2019s to retro rum punches, all dressed to impress with flamingo stirrers, umbrellas and tropical garnishes.\r\n\r\nA golden-age soundtrack sets the mood, featuring the smooth calypso of Harry Belafonte, beachy vibes from The Beach Boys, and sun-drenched classics by Astrud Gilberto.\r\n\r\nClub Tropicana is a winter getaway, fun and fabulously over the top.",

This is an excellent opportunity to treat yourself to some creative fun!\n\nIn weeks one and two you'll learn how to work with jeweller's hard wax to create beautiful textures in metal that can be used to create amazing rings or objects. Your waxes will be sent away for casting in the metal of your choice.\n\nThen there will be a week's break before the third session, to allow time for everyone's waxes to be cast. The third session covers how to trim, clean and finish your casts, turning them into original jewellery ready to wear!\n\nMore advanced students can use these sessions to complete projects in a class setting.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are all your different types of waxes, sandpaper and courier costs.\n\nNot included are the casting and metal costs which vary from student to student depending on what sized ring they want to make and the type of metal you choose.

Each reading will be followed by a 30 minute chat with the writer, facilitated by the director.

Playwrights will need to register for this free workshop which has 20 spaces.\nThe whole event is NZSL interpreted.

    "long_description": "Wellington\u2019s iconic Old St Paul\u2019s will play host to a transcendent new series in August, partnering with the Pyramid Club to present Altared States, a unique electronic music experience.\nSet beneath the exquisite stained-glass windows of one of Te Whanganui-a-Tara\u2019s most exquisite landmarks, this series promises an immersive sonic experience that invites audiences to explore sound in a deeply personal and transformative way.\nAltared States is inspired by Brian Sweeney\u2019s New York-founded Ambient Church, an initiative dedicated to collaborating with artists to create transformative audio performances in architecturally significant spaces. This series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\nEach of the evenings will bring a different electronic vibe, conjured by some of Wellington\u2019s most innovative artists. The series lineup includes:\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\nTickets are available from Wednesday 18 June, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\nAbout the Artists\nLudus\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\nStephen Gallagher\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\nDavid Long\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\nJules Desmond\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\nOghum\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\nJess Chambers\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration.

    "long_description": "La Bella: 25th Anniversary - Strictly Vinyl edition!\n\nIn 2000, La Belle wasn\u2019t just a party, it was a reckoning. A bold, bass-heavy moment in Wellington\u2019s club history where women behind the decks claimed the space loud and proud. No permission. No compromise. Just raw talent, deep crates, and dance floor alchemy. It was a night where sonic mischief met feminine force, and the booth finally belonged to women who had long been left out of the spotlight.\n\n25 years later, the original trio returns, not to recreate the past, but to honour the legacy and remind us why it mattered.\n\nMiss Robyn, the original host and pulse of the La Belle movement, brings her instinctive, unapologetic selections back to centre stage.\nOdette (aka Gimpgirl), known for her subversive sets and fearless mixing, returns with the same attitude that shook up lazy lineups and demanded more from every beat.\nAmber (aka Bandit), the international wax slinger whose fingerprints still live on half the city's record sleeves, comes home to channel decades of global experience into one unmissable set.\n\nThis is no nostalgia act. This is a vinyl-fuelled rebellion.\n\nAll vinyl. All night.\nFrom classic house to rolling techno and razor-sharp breaks, this is a celebration of the women who carved their place in the booth and never let go.\n\nNo sync buttons. No trend-chasing. No gimmicks.\nJust three women taking the dance floor hostage, one more time.",

    "long_description": "What is Porirua parkrun? It is a free 5km walk or run event - It\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people.\n\nThe start occurs just upstream of the Bothamley Park carpark. This car park is off Champion street, opposite the intersection with Windley Street. Head to end of carpark where the concrete ends and there is a gate. For location see https://goo.gl/maps/wEohfp9bRu82.\n\nThe course is following the old coach road (circa 1870's) established for the early farms in the area. Today this historic track is located within a park, away from cars and now used by walkers, runners and cyclists.\n\nThe track is generally 3 metres wide with a gentle gradient and a compacted gravel surface beside the Kenepuru Stream through a picturesque wooded wild valley. (Note there is a pinch point for a short section after the 2km marker where participants need to go single file each direction for approx 30 metres)\n\nThe valley runs east-west with mature trees which means this has to be one of the most sheltered places, out of the wind to exercise in Wellington.\n\nWhat does it cost to join in? Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run or walk, so you can get your timing results. You only need to register with parkrun once, to participate at any of the parkrun events around the world. Don't forget to bring a copy of your barcode. If you forget it, you won't get a time.\n\nHow fast do I have to be? Walking is fine as long as you can finish the 5km. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!\n\nOne dog per adult is welcome, as long as it is on a short hand held lead.\n\nChildren welcome but those 10 years and under need to be kept within arms reach of a supervising adult.\n\nNote there is no toilets in the park, so go before you go.\n\nWe're friendly! Every week we grab a post park run/walk coffee/tea at Get Fixed within Kai Tahi at 20 Parumoana Street, to mix exercise with socialising.\n\nThere are volunteering opportunities even week. So those doing Duke of Edinburgh or similar challenges can get volunteer credits. Ensure you contact us well in advance at \"porirua@parkrun.co.nz\"",

The exhibition title is inspired by a line from John Berger\u2019s seminal 1977 essay \u2018Why Look at Animals?\u2019 Berger argued that the relationship between humans and animals \u2013 \u2018our unspeaking companionship\u2019 \u2013 has been transformed by capitalism.\nMessengers brings together historical and contemporary ways of looking at animals in photography and art. It features archival photographs from the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Collections, first taken by newspaper photographers in the mid twentieth century. The images capture everything from the polar bears once housed in Wellington Zoo, to an elderly gentleman standing amongst the life size concrete animal sculptures in his garden.\u202fThese images are at once tender and loving, sentimental and silly, kind and indifferent.\nMessengers places these archival photographs in proximity and conversation with contemporary sculpture and moving image works by four Aotearoa-based artists: Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox. From eerie AI and computer-generated animals to the hypnotic stare of a real live Ruru; from carved wooden godwits you can hold in your hand to \u2018hominoid\u2019 brooches, each artist\u2019s work speaks to the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nIMAGE Brit Bunkley, still from Transit, single channel video, 2025",

(NZ citizen and residents free with ID, all others pay $109).\n\nIn your middle years, working, retired or somewhere in between? What\u2019s next? Life is about much more than work or leisure, but most of us have given little thought to what \u201cretirement\u201d might mean.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to speculate what may happen in the future \u2013 but we can be proactive and take control.\nThis course offers insights into how to make the most of our time once we\u2019re less focused on career and/or childrearing. It covers many of the issues people face when considering a move from current employment to a different lifestyle that includes more time to do the things we\u2019ve always promised ourselves we\u2019d do \u2013 \u201cwhen we retire\u201d.\n\nAfter the workshop, you\u2019ll be able to identify a number of common issues and potential ways to manage them when considering and planning your \u201crejuvenation\u201d, rather than a retirement. We won\u2019t cover financial planning, but will focus on some of the personal growth opportunities for living and making a conscious contribution to your community.\n\nBy the end of the day, you\u2019ll have:\n- Developed your own perspective on ageing and retirement in the 21st Century and identified what\u2019s important to you\n- Completed a personal life audit exercise and considered your strengths\n- Explored possibilities in the major aspects of your life and identified potential challenges and strategies for overcoming them\n- Developed a blueprint to maximise the best years of your life and developed a \u201cfuture proofing\u201d downsizing plan\n- Considered options to include a sense of purpose and explored and implemented choices that provide you with that sense of purpose\nBring a pen and paper.\n\n1 day, Sat 9:30 AM \u2013 4:00 PM\nWellington High School\nPresented by Angela Robertson",

Hear artists Denise Batchelor, Brit Bunkley, Jane Dodd and John Ward Knox in a series of conversations with curator Megan Dunn, about how each artists work ask us to consider the \u2018unspeaking companionship\u2019 between humanity and other animals.\nDenise Batchelor is a visual artist based in Hokianga, in the far north of New Zealand. Batchelor has an MFA (2010) from Whitecliffe College of Arts and Design, Auckland. Working primarily in digital media, both still and moving image, Batchelor\u2019s work reflects personal encounters within nature; quiet moments of reflection within which deeper connections can be experienced. She has exhibited widely in New Zealand for the past fifteen years, and internationally in Sweden, Germany, Italy, USA, Scotland and France. A recipient of artist residencies and art awards, her work is held in public and private collections.\nBrit Bunkley is a New Zealand-based artist and videographer whose practice spans sculpture, installation, and digital media. A recipient of the US National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, two NY state grants, and the Rome Prize Fellowship, his work explores the intersection of physical and virtual spaces, often blending surreal imagery with themes of history, politics, and environmental concerns. He has exhibited at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa and internationally at Rencontres Internationales Paris/Berlin, FILE S\u00e3o Paulo (including 2025), and the Athens Digital Arts Festival. Recent exhibitions include Visions in the Nunnery, London (2022), Cybersculpture 2024 at Coll\u00e8ge des Bernardins, Paris, and The Torrance Art Museum, LA (2025). In 2024, he won Best Art | Experimental Video/Film at the New York City Independent Film Festival. His work continues to evolve, embracing new technologies and alternative methodologies to challenge perceptions of reality and imagination.\nJane Dodd is a contemporary jeweller based in Dunedin. Dodd has a BA from Otago University and a Diploma in 3D design from UNITEC in Auckland. Since the early \u201890s she has exhibited widely in solo and group exhibitions in New Zealand and internationally.\nHer jewellery is largely a carving-based practice utilizing re-purposed woods and bone. Narratives from the environment and animal world, homages to historic crafts, critiques of modern society, mysterious plotlines, comedy and tragedy can all be found in her jewellery.\nJohn Ward Knox is an artist living in Karitane, north of \u014ctepoti (Dunedin). He has a Master of Fine Arts from Elam School of Fine Arts and was the recipient of the National Drawing Award, in 2008, and the Frances Hodgkins Fellowship at Otago University, in 2015. His work has been included in The Archibald Prize, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney (2020) and is included in New Zealand and Australian collections.

    "long_description": "Life drawing with a difference - it's Life Drawing @ Wellington Naturist Club. The next one is on Sunday 17th Aug 2025.\nWe have the sessions monthly. If the weather is not suitable for outdoor life drawing then we'll be inside, nice and warm.\nThe fee for life drawing is the normal Day Visit Fee of $20, for non-members. (The life drawing is otherwise free for Club members and for non-members who are paying for an overnight stay on the Sat or Sun nights.)\nBring some lunch. Morning and afternoon tea are provided. You can bring your own art materials, or you can use some that are provided. Come to either draw or to model or swap between the two. All the models are volunteers, so a nice variety of shapes and sizes all in the one session. Draw if you like. Model if you like.\nThe session format: beginning the session with 2 minute poses to warm-up, then increasing the pose lengths to something between 10-30 minutes. Each model posing chooses how long their pose(s) will be in that 10-30 minute range.\nSome tuition is given to those who would like it. We'll be life drawing from 11am until 3pm, but you\u2019re very welcome to come and go as you please, and to use the club facilities. It's a pretty casual event.\nThere's full kitchen facilities, BBQ facilities, the new hot tub, spa, sauna, table tennis, golf, eels to feed, bush walks etc. Make a day of it if you like.\nIf you're coming for the life drawing at the club, then the only time anyone is obliged to wear \"club uniform\" is if you're modelling for the life drawing, or you\u2019re using the spa/hot tub/sauna/pool. Otherwise just wear - or don't wear - what you like. No need to book either, just come enjoy the day.\nWellington Naturist Club, 20 Molloys Rd, Te Marua, Upper Hutt 5018. Call the club mobile 027 330 6212 when you get to the gate, so you can be buzzed in. Then follow the signs to park and come up to the hall to see where we will be having the session. ",

They regularly delight audiences at a number of Wellington venues, and are frequently invited to perform outside of Wellington. Over the years they have played Auckland, Tauranga, Manawatu, Nelson and Wellington Jazz and Blues Festivals.\nWellington Heads have recorded six albums, their latest, \u2018World Keep On Turning\u2019 was released in December 2023. This album continues their unique sound with a mix of rhythm n\u2019 blues, swing, soul and latino grooves. In combining this with their previous albums, Wellington Heads have built an extensive repertoire of eclectic original songs.  \nNeil Worboys \u2013 vocals, guitar, harmonica, Bill Wood \u2013 guitars, Geoff Keith \u2013 bass, Nic Deighton \u2013 drums, Phil Costello \u2013 saxophone, Andy Weir \u2013 trumpet",

For this show he will be playing songs from his upcoming fourth album \u201cHands\u201d and will be joined by long time friend and collaborator, Scott Pilgrim.\n\nBeans is a recent fixture in the P\u014dneke folk scene, importing a wild array of original songs and generally embodying the classic singer songwriter formula \u2013 introvert plus guitar. They gained international acclaim in 2021 as a finalist in the Liverpool International Song Contest, and have since performed at small venues and festivals across Australia and Aotearoa.

Her last album \u2018Tug of War\u2019 included the pivotal release of the 2022 APRA NZ Best Country Song \u2018Trouble Finds a Girl\u2019 and was described by Rolling Stone as an album, \u201cworthy of every award it will inevitably collect.\u201d\nNo stranger to the road, Jenny was recently awarded a scholarship to perform at Nashville\u2019s iconic AmericanaFest and has toured Australia and New Zealand extensively over the last decade - supporting artists including Fanny Lumsden (AU), Tami Neilson (NZ) and Nadia Reid (NZ) along the way. Her most recent touring project, The Bush & the Birds Tour, travelled throughout NZ in support of conservation organisation; Forest & Bird. An ode to her late Grandfather\u2019s love of the land, the tour generated over $2000 in donations for Forest & Bird.\nJenny grew up in a home and family of music and often tours with her sisters, The Mitchell Twins, and country music loving Dad, Ron Mitchell. After growing up with a musical diet of The Chicks, Hank Williams and Dolly Parton, Jenny penned her first songs at the age of 11 after a trip to Ireland where she connected with her Irish heritage and explored the immigration story of her Irish born Grandparents. A few years down the track, Jenny performed original work on the TV show New Zealand's Got Talent, was placed 3rd and went onto crowdfund and release her first album at the age of 15. In 2017, she was crowned the overall winner of the NZ Gold Guitar Awards which kickstarted the professional chapter of her career, leading to her Aotearoa Music Award Winning album 'Wildfires\u2019 produced by Tasmania\u2019s Matt Fell.\nWith a sound that No Depression describes as, \u201cpoetry that dominates a beautiful melody,\u201d Jenny Mitchell is comfortable with a country twang or softly spoken ballad and is rapidly capturing fans across the globe.\n",

Guests get a front-row seat to the action, while supporting a truly game-changing enterprise.\r\n\r\n4 August \u2014 Jessie Gibberd, Loretta\r\nOriginally from rural Waikato, Jessie Gibberd made the move to Wellington to study, but it was the buzz of hospitality that captured her heart. Swapping textbooks for tongs, she left her degree behind to dive headfirst into the kitchen. Now a chef de partie at Loretta, Jessie brings a grounded, fresh perspective to one of the city\u2019s most beloved eateries.\r\n\r\n11 August \u2014 Felipe Molina, El Matador\r\nHailing from Chile, Felipe Molina is a professional chef with over 15 years of experience in kitchens around the world.

From there, he headed to Queenstown, learning from a wide range of chefs and kitchen styles before challenging himself with a move to Wellington. Since then, he\u2019s worked at some of the city\u2019s top restaurants and now brings his thoughtful, evolving style to Graze Wine Bar.\r\n\r\n25 August \u2014 Lulu Temmuyin, Mr Go\u2019s\r\nLulu Temmuyin is a chef who loves pushing boundaries, even when they\u2019re unexpected. Lactose intolerant but obsessed with cheese, and not a fan of lamb but winner of a lamb cooking competition, Lulu is all about surprises. At Mr Go\u2019s, she brings bold, sustainable flavour to the forefront, blending personality with punch in every dish.\r\n\r\nEverybody Eats runs on a pay-what-you-can model, transforming food waste into gourmet meals and bringing the community together over good kai.

    "description": "Tuesday Wellbeing Seminars: Peace Over Panic: Rewiring the Anxious Mind How do we respond when the mind spirals, when uncertainty clouds our judgement, or when we find ourselves at a personal breaking point?\nThis workshop draws from ancient and time-tested wisdom found in yoga philosophy \u2014 especially the Bhagavad Gita \u2014 to explore how anxiety and inner conflict can become turning points for insight and conscious action.\nRather than avoiding or suppressing discomfort, the Gita offers a way to meet it \u2014 with clarity, honesty, and meaningful direction.\nThrough a blend of philosophical reflection and grounded tools, we\u2019ll explore how to steady the mind and reconnect with deeper purpose in the face of pressure or doubt.\nThe seminar will be followed by a delicious plant-based dinner together, all included in your ticket!"

The National War Memorial and FPC Martin Square are both undergoing major refurbishment - join us for a look behind the scenes!\nNational War Memorial: Refurbishing a Wellington Icon\nStep behind the scaffolding and witness the National War Memorial Project \u2013 a complex seismic strengthening project where heritage sensitivity is of utmost importance. With construction works being carried out by Maycroft Construction, join us for the rare opportunity to explore a significant piece of the capital\u2019s cultural fabric.\nKnown to many as the backdrop of ANZAC Day commemorations, this national memorial is undergoing a meticulous refurbishment to ensure its legacy endures for generations to come.\n What\u2019s Happening On Site:\nSeismic strengthening of the tower and bell frame \nStone remediation to preserve its historic fa\u00e7ade\nAsphalt roofing works\nThe real challenge? Balancing modern engineering with heritage preservation. Every upgrade is being carried out with deep respect for the building\u2019s historical significance.\n\nThen, just around the corner, we will move on to another refurbishment project \u2013 at a much different scale and for a very different purpose!\n FPC Martin Square: from Workshop to Office Space\nLeading industrial design-and-build specialists First Principles Constructors are celebrating seven years of innovation with a bold move - into a brand-new headquarters in central Wellington. Take a look inside the transformation of a former engineering workshop into the new HQ for FPC. With exposed services, raw materials, and an industrial aesthetic, this compact yet clever refurbishment shows how much can be achieved in a small urban footprint.

All materials and tools are supplied at each class - but you are welcome to bring your own and we highly encourage bringing a textile item (or many!) to fix up.\nIn August we're lino printing!\nClass 01: 13th August\nIn this class we'll get an introduction to lino printing on fabric and best practice for using this process to cover stains. Pre cut designs and all other tools are supplied. Please bring either clothing you would like to print on or some fabric scrap to make lino printed patches!\nClass 02: 20th August\nAt this class Aisha will take us through the process of designing and cutting our own lino to print with!

    "long_description": "Musical improv can be absolute magic. Whether it's a whole musical show, or single song that bursts out of an emotional scene, music adds so much to our improv.\nThis course for improvisers will give an introduction to musical improv. We'll cover basic song structures, how to get into a song from a scene, how to support a song through chorus work, and why and when we use music to add to our improv.\nParticipants should be confident in scene-work and have at least 2 years improv experience. This course will not teach you how to approach scenes and characters, so you should have a solid foundation which you can add to with this new toolbox of musical skills.\nThe course includes 6 workshops which will run 6:30pm to 8:30pm on Wednesdays from August 6th to September 10th. As it is an intro course, we do not anticipate a showcase for this course.\nABOUT THE TEACHERS\nLIA KELLY is a theatre-maker and teacher based in P\u014dneke. She is an established director, actor, improviser and musician and has been a part of productions across the city over the last 10 years. She directed One Night Band which won 'Most Original Production' at the Wellington Theatre Awards 2023, and performs regularly as both a player and musician for POPROX.\nISAAC THOMAS has been an improviser and improv musician for a decade in P\u014dneke and Whakat\u016b/Nelson. He's played with Body in Space, Playshop, Poprox and been musical director for musical improv powerhouse The P\u0101ua Ballads. He has worked with almost every major improv company around the city accompanying them through improvised piano, guitar and vocals.\nTHE STANDY-BY LIST\nPopRox firmly believes that improv is for everyone, especially when it comes to sharing skills and knowledge. So we're offering \"the stand-by list\" for all our workshops in 2025. We'll giveaway any spots remaining a few days before the first workshop of the course, on a first-come-first-serve basis. No need to provide a reason, no questions asked. If the entry fee is a barrier for you to come along, then simply email poproximprov@gmail.com and we'll pop you on the SBL. Everyone on the list will be notified whether there was a place available for them 3 days before the first workshop. ",

Settling in Te Whanganui-a-tara in 2022 gave Everingham the opportunity to grow Dateline into a well-oiled and rehearsed creative machine alongside musical geniuses Hikurangi Schaverien-Kaa, Phoebe Johnson and Reuben McDonald. Refining their song writing and live performance has helped the band produce an incredible and energetic live show that is ready to be taken on the road.\nAfter being invited to support The Beths on tour through the UK, parts of Europe and Scandinavia the band knew that they had to grab the opportunity by the proverbial horns. They have most of the ingredients to make the experience happen and fruitful, bar one, money. Despite this they said yes to the invite and are now figuring out how to make the dream a reality.\nThe conundrum of how to fund the international 25 date tour led to the decision to frantically arrange a fundraising extravaganza at Meow Nui, thrown together in one month with minimal planning or time to adequately promote the gig! Fantastic! Due to the love and support of a lot of local legends who have volunteered themselves to participate, the fundraising scheme has morphed from a desperate idea into a desperate reality. Come along for one of the best evenings of entertainment you\u2019ll witness all August.\nAs well as showcasing the songs they\u2019ll be taking on the road, Dateline will be joined by talented musical acts such as Wiri Donna, French For Rabbits, Wellington's favourite saxophone playing tree - Woody, Dateband, Flute Journeys and Ladyhawke (DJ set). There will also be compelling performances from dance troupe BTD bitches and performance artists Twin Snag. This will be a night to remember.\nPlease for the love of god, buy a ticket, invite everyone you know and come to the show so I, I mean, Katie doesn\u2019t bankrupt herself desperately clinging to the hopes of being a sometimes-touring musician.\nTickets available at Ticketek ",

    "long_description": "5 years of Mouthfull Radio\n\n\nHalf a decade ago, we were in the midst of a global pandemic, visiting digital rooms with friends around the corner, making sourdough, and watching the daily news. We were also making experimental attempts into the world of radio, with the birth of Mouthfull\u2019s first international streaming server, playing music 24/7 (and live events a few times per week).\nIf we travel even further back in time, 2017 was the debut of the \u201cMouthfull Radio\u201d episodic series (~20eps) - but we consider the ongoingness the real thing to celebrate.\nMoving forwards into the presence now, and through an immense richness of events, music, zines, connections, pop ups, and storytime. It is a joy to make community contemporary radio !\n\n\n5 Years goes so fast, and so we shall honour this time with a great celebration in the capital city of Aotearoa! We will bring together all of the elements of Mouthfull you have known to love; make some books, make up some new dance moves with friends, and make our ears glisten in the sounds of live and selected music.\n\n\nLineup:\n*\u00baJuniper May\n*\u00baStar Time\n*\u00baajhoneysuckle (t\u0101maki)\n*\u00baMystery Waitress\n*\u00baDJ B.Lo (wh\u0101katu)\n*\u00b0Benny Salvador *Just added*\n\n\nWe are also releasing our first ever compilation !!! And we will celebrate and commemorate by opening this event with a premiere listening session, playing the album all the way through. You can purchase a copy at the show or on bandcamp (preorders open August 1st).\n\n\nThis is a fundraiser to support the sustainability of Mouthfull. We are only able to pay the bills due to events like this, and are fundraising to support a long awaited update of our digital infrastructure to enable future support. THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT - you can support us by purchasing a ticket (extra donation if you are balling), a tshirt, a raffle ticket, or a zine - it all goes to the same goal of enabling each other.\n",

    "description": "This inspiring Sunday afternoon jewellery blocks are the best way for beginners to get into jewellery making in a lively, warm and friendly environment!\nThe course starts on Sun 24 August and runs for 4 weeks until Sun 14 September, 2pm-5pm.\nBeginners will practice the basic techniques in copper or brass and then move on quickly to working in silver.\nAn excellent first project for beginners in this class is to create a simple textured ring band - but once you have the basics down, it is fun to create earrings, pendants or other simple items.\nLearning to cut, heat, form and texture metal - to solder using a jeweller's torch and silver solder, and finally to polish your work up to a beautiful finish: these classes are super satisfying."

It starts on Sun 24 August and runs for 4 weeks until Sun 14 September, 2pm - 5pm.\nBeginners will practice the basic techniques in copper or brass and then move on to working in silver. An excellent first project for beginners in this class is to create a simple textured ring band - but once you have the basics down, it is fun to create earrings, pendants or other simple items. Learning to cut, heat, form and texture metal - to solder using a jeweller's torch and silver solder, and finally to polish your work up to a beautiful finish: these classes are super satisfying.\nThese blocks are also a nice way for existing students or more advanced makers to work on more challenging projects and join friendly classes in our well-equipped warm studio!\nBasic materials are supplied and there are extra materials available to purchase as you need in class.\nThis block is great for teens and kids over 12 or so. NOTE: Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an enrolled parent or caregiver.\nOur booking system asks for full payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking.

Fronted by the enigmatic Ruth Carr, her coy persona ignites while bandmates Ryan Beehre and Paul Dodge forge rib-rattling beats around her.\nTheir debut album, The 88, released in 2003, achieved gold status in New Zealand, quickly followed up by the 'I Hate Guns' EP.\nOver the following decade, the trio toured their synths and samplers from Helsinki to Hanoi crafting their own refreshing sound \u2013 storming The Crystal Method's club night in LA, the FabricLive birthday bash in London, and headlining the Hanoi Music Festival in Vietnam. Along with festivals and shows up and down Aotearoa.\nHaving been retired since 2014, we\u2019re excited to announce that Minuit are back onstage for a limited number of reunion shows.\nThese reunion performances will pay tribute to classic tunes from all four albums 'The Boy with the Aubergine Hair', 'Except You', 'Fuji', 'Menace', \u2018Aotearoa\u2019, \u2018I Hate Guns\u2019, \u2018A Room Full of Cute\u2019, 'Last Night You Saw This Band', \u201825 Bucks\u2019 \u2013 everything gets a look in, plus a couple of other surprises.\nThe show will be supported by Western Haikus and JOLA BURNS.\nMinuit has a heart. And it beats loud. Real loud.",

And for dessert, it\u2019s that cookie. The giant one. Gorgeous to share or go full meltdown mode \u2014 it\u2019s your call. All paired with cocktails and drinks that complement the evening perfectly. After all, as Megan says, \"I'm gonna climb that like a tree.\" And yes, by \"that,\" we mean the drinks list.

In the late 1800s, small numbers of Chinese settled in Samoa and became part of a growing multicultural community. There they influenced local customs, made an enduring contribution to Samoan cuisine introducing contemporary favourites such as sapasui (chop suey), keke pua\u2018a (pork buns) and of course laisa (rice). \r\n\r\nDragons celebrate this cultural and culinary fusion by showcasing these favourites and presenting new dishes highlighting the shared love of culinary staples such as taro and noodles, rice, fish, and pork, the magnificent spectrum of Chinese herbs, spices and flavours. Through cooking and sharing food together the chefs honour their culinary heritage, strengthen our connections to one another and celebrate the big and little moments in life. This is a shared-style meal, served banquet style on lazy Susan turntables. \r\nDragons is My Uso was one of the sell-out hits of the 2024 festival - don't miss out!\r\n\r\nDiscounted tables for 10 available for $1000, so get the whole aiga together!",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene and GIB.\nCPD points: 10\nTIMING:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLECTURE DATES:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

    "long_description": "Grab a spot on our couch and enjoy the noise at The Racket Lounge, a chill classical music series featuring up-and-coming P\u014dneke classical and jazz musicians.\n\nLast year the NZSQ Trust launched the Racket Lounge, a concert series for classical and jazz musicians with experience ranging from students to pros to freely express their creativity in a non-traditional concert setting. It was a huge success, with over 250 audience members and 52 artists over our four sessions. Audiences were raving about the musical variety and great talent they found at the Racket Lounge, and as one audience member commented; \u201cWell done\u2026do it again!\u201d So, we listened, and the Racket Lounge is back for round two! Once again hosted at Bedlam & Squalor (above the Rogue & Vagabond), we welcome audiences, composers and performers back for another four concerts full of innovative, fun, and chill music. From classical to pop covers, video game soundtracks to original compositions, there's something for everyone to sink their teeth into at The Racket Lounge!\n\nEven if you've never been to a classical music concert before, this one is for you. With a 'Choose your price' model you can afford to give it a go - and you might even find something you like!\n\nA Flexible Price, So You Can Take A Chance on Something New:\nOur prices range from $5 to $100, just pick the ticket price you feel like paying. At The Racket Lounge, we believe everyone should have access to high-quality but affordable art. If you're a bit strapped for cash right now, but still want a good night out, no worries! Just book yourself a $5 ticket! If you can afford to pay a little more and want to do some good for your community, then pick one of our higher ticket prices and rest assured that your dollars are going towards funding great, accessible art in your city.\n\nAll proceeds from ticket sales will go directly into presenting the next Racket Lounge, including paying musicians and artists, hiring instruments and marketing costs. Plus, by choosing a higher price point, you're ensuring that we're able to continue to offer tickets at a lower price point for those who need it.\n\nPlease note: Bedlam & Squalor is a licenced venue, so under 18s must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Everyone must bring ID.",

    "long_description": "Creative writing and painting are both powerful forms of artistic expression. By integrating creative writing into your painting practice, you can enhance your imagination, storytelling abilities, emotional expression, attention to detail, and personal style on the canvas. Please bring along a journal or laptop.\n\nCOURSE CONTENT\nEach session presents a key idea backed by research or concrete examples, followed by practical writing exercises with optional sharing. We learn by doing and from each other.\n\n1. Generating work from the interior: tapping into memories, conflict, emotion, and observation to generate art.\n2. Figuring out what matters to you, then learning how to grow your fragmented ideas into something whole. For example, how do you turn a feeling, or a fleeting moment in time into a story? Into a painting? Into a work of art? What are the building blocks you need?\n3. Inspiration from other creative sources: people, music, poetry, reading, random incidents. Ways to generate fresh ideas. How to clarify and focus in writing and art.\n4. Structure and boundaries. Dreaming big but being real. How do you find and stick to a creative process? Understanding how you learn and what kind of feedback you need. Designing your next project.\n\nThursday mornings, 9:30 - 11:45 am.\n4 - 25 September.",

These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University.

    "long_description": "Taiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.",

ONE WOMAN GIVING BIRTH TO THE NEXT, ON AND ON THROUGH TIME, UNTIL HERE AND NOW.\n\nThis is AN INVITATION TO COME PLAY, to create with your own hands little Womb Women in honour of your own matriarchal lineage \u2026 with hands that have been created from the DNA of all your ancestors before you.\nAs I sit and sculpt each woman, I become deeply aware that the bone and flesh of my own hands hold the DNA of all my grandmothers. How many of them had their own stories of shaping clay, forming sculptural figures, moulding pots .. what was it my grandmother of 200 thousand years ago created I wonder. \nThrough the evolution of humanity, the hands of approximately 100 thousand womb to womb women of my unique bloodline have given birth to my own. Our shared DNA forms these hands which are now shaping clay.\nEach one of us has our own special womb to womb lineage, with a unique tone particular only to us, perhaps similar to another, however no one female whakapapa is truly the same.  \nPerhaps you will have a particular mother or grandmother in mind as you create, imbuing their passed down wisdom into the clay figurine, perhaps the little woman you make will symbolize your entire line, calling up the flavour of your own unique lineage, or perhaps she is you and represents your own story \u2026 or maybe she will hold for you the wisdom of the ancient mother that resides within us all. \nDO COME JOIN US for an afternoon of making your own little womb women.\nNO EXPERIENCE NEEDED, simply bring a curiosity and willingness to play, surrounded by other humans doing just the same.\nPRACTACALITIES,\nbring a cushion and blanket (you may prefer to sit comfortably on the floor as you make - there will also be tables and chairs available)\nif you are already familiar with clay and have your own favorite hand tools please feel free to bring these\nsnacks and hot/cold beverages will be available\nWorkshop cost includes supplies, materials and firing. I will fire your creation then post it back to you, therefore postage will be extra and determined once packaged up.\nPLEASE NOTE!!! This booking is for FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER\n                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cWithin the DNA is written not only our histories as individuals but the whole history of the human race \u2026 patterns of DNA that have come down to us virtually unchanged from our distant ancestors \u2013 ancestors who are no longer just an abstract entity but real people who lived in conditions very different from those we enjoy today, who survived them and brought up their children.\u201d ~ Bryan Sykes (The Seven Daughters of Eve)\nReturn to MAIN EXHIBITION WEBSITE - link coming soon",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.",

The Orchestra is a national trailblazer in big band history and features New Zealand compositions, and a classic repertoire from the golden era of big band swing jazz of Ellington and Basie.\n\nThe band benefits from a depth of talent that most military bands around the world would only dream of and is made up of Wellington\u2019s most exceptional musicians.\n\n\u201cThe line-up will be a who\u2019s who of the Wellington jazz scene,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s a while since we had a big band at the festival, so we\u2019re elated to have the Airforce Jazz Orchestra back with us again. They last played at the festival in 2014. Many of the band members have been here since, but not as part of a big band,\u201d says Lee.\n\nBe Transported by April\u2019s Fools\nImagine stepping back in time to a speak easy club. A smoky, dimly lit room where the anticipation is electric but the vibe is laid-back and relaxed. . .\n\nFrom the stage a jazz swing and blues band begins to play, their instruments blending seamlessly in a harmonious symphony of sound. The rhythm section, with its upright bass and snare drums, lays down a groove that's impossible to resist, while the saxophone punctuates the air with soulful notes.\n\nAt. the forefront stands a captivating female singer, her voice rich and velvety, weaving tales of heartache, joy, and everything in between. Her vocal prowess brings both swing and blues to life, effortlessly moving from sultry, slow blues ballads to energetic, foot-tapping swing numbers.\n\nThis band doesn't just play music; they create an experience that transports the audience to another era, where the essence of jazz and blues reigns supreme.\n\nWelcome to an evening of superb swing jazz and blues brought to you by the band that is April\u2019s Fools. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely wrapt to be bringing this ultra-talented and experienced combo to the festival,\u201d says Music Director Lee Quayle. \u201cWhenever, and wherever this group of musicians have played reviewers have to search the thesaurus for new superlatives to describe the show, and audiences leave reluctantly, but happy.\u201d\n\nApril\u2019s Fools are April Phillips (vocals), Greg Crayford (drums), Zak Dikvert (guitar), Nicholas Bauke-Maunsell (saxophone), Miles Crayford (keyboards) and RoryMacartney (bass). They will be playing at Jazz in Martinborough on Friday 5 September 2025 as the opening of the ticketed festival gigs to be held in the Town Hall.",

Each of the six laps is slightly over 7km, with around 400m in elevation (2500m in total). Try not to trip on a loose rock while taking in the aromatic smells emanating from the tip. Ignore the gale-force northerly.

Same course as above but three laps instead of six,\nRecommended donation: $25\nTip Track Marathon (TTM) is a low-key, no frills trail running race that takes place at the Tip Track in Wellington each year - all in the name of charity. TTM is all about hard hills, high-fives, and doing something stupid for the sake of it. There are no prizes. Your workmates will not understand why you did this. It\u2019s not even that fun.\nThis is a race for those that want a little more from life than the ordinary. Those that question the monotony of their daytime jobs and wonder, \"isn't there meant to be more to life than this?\" Enter TTM... I mean, you won't find any answers here but those are the people that tend to be attracted to it.\nDONATIONS:\nAll entry fees charged go to our charities for 2025:\nYouthline Wellington\nSocial Supermarket\nThere is a recommended donation amount for each race of $40 (TTM) or $25 (Half).

    "long_description": "Financially successful people don\u2019t achieve their wealth by accident \u2013 they make and execute clear plans. Your retirement is on the horizon and research shows you\u2019re most likely nowhere near financially ready for the retirement you desire and deserve! Get a complete and utterly practical financial plan, so you can have the retirement you want.\n\nMassey University's annual Retirement Expenditure Guidelines study (2019) found:\n\nJust 40% of pre-retirees believed they were well-prepared for retirement, and 57% considered retirement to be a concern. They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support, and if you needed to obtain Government-assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\n\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years. But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\n\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you!\n\nThis course has been developed for people in their 50s or 60s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help.\n\nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement.\n\nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement.\n\nYou will work through a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details. You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information.\n\nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.\n\nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of? If not, then this course is for you.\n\nDisclaimer: The tutors are not financial advisors. No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided. A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study. Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed. Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\n\nNote: Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel. We'll let you know by email so please check yours regularly. If you need to cancel your registration, here are our terms and conditions: \"What You Need to Know\".\n\n1 Day\nPresented by Paul and Mary-Ellen Gadd.",

The practice has won numerous Australian and international awards and has been published and exhibited widely, including at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008 and 2012.\nInitially studying civil and structural engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute in New Zealand, Ian moved on to study architecture at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating with honours in 1988.\nIan has taught at numerous universities and been a speaker and guest lecturer throughout Australia as well as internationally.\nIan has also been a member of awards juries in Australia, New Zealand and at the World Festival of Interiors in 2013 and the World Architecture Festival in 2015. In 2003, Ian was the inaugural Creative Director for the Australian Institute of Architects annual conference.\nAbout the Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture\nThe annual Sir Ian Athfield Memorial Lecture commemorates the late Ian Athfield, a singular and much-loved figure in New Zealand architecture.\nAffectionately known as \u2018Ath\u2019, Ian was knighted in 2014 and was one of New Zealand\u2019s most influential architects. He won more than 60 national and international architecture and design awards and the lecture series was established to honour his legacy and celebrate his larrikin spirit.\nIn keeping with that spirit, each year the lecture is given by a person with something to say \u2013 someone who is challenging orthodoxy and a business-as-usual approach to practice, and life.\nDuring his career, Ath designed many significant buildings, none more so than his own home in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, which enraged the neighbours, perplexed the Council and inspired the city for decades.\nAth was talented, original, insightful, opinionated, provocative, and sometimes outrageous. His architecture is stimulating, challenging, ever-changing, but never careless.\nIn 2004, Te K\u0101hui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architects awarded Ath the Gold Medal for career achievements, noting at the time \u201cWhat defines Athfield above all is his contagious enthusiasm, his devotion to architecture, and his unswerving belief in its possibilities. Believing architecture to be a civilising force, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to architecture\u2019s public realm: the streets we live in; the urban centres we inhabit; the countryside we love and so often abuse.\u201d\nThe Sir Ian Athfield Lecture Series is proudly sponsored by Resene.\nTiming:\nDoors open: 5.00pm\nLecture: 5.30pm - 6.30pm\nQ&A: 6.30pm - 7.00pm\nLecture dates:\nTe Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington | Wednesday 3 September | Michael Fowler Centre\nT\u0101huna Queenstown | Friday 5 September | Crowne Plaza\nWhakat\u016b Nelson | Tuesday 9 September | The Suter - Te Aratoi o Whakat\u016b\n\u014ctautahi Christchurch | Wednesday 10 September | Black Box Theatre - Papa Hou\nHeretaunga Hastings | Thursday 11 September | Toi Toi\nNg\u0101motu New Plymouth | Monday 15 September | Novotel\nKirikiriroa Hamilton | Tuesday 16 September | Bill Gallagher Centre\nT\u0101maki Makaurua Auckland | Thursday 18 September | TBC",

    "long_description": "I offer an alternative macrohistory of the Liberal International Order (LIO) that was explicitly designed to perpetuate Western dominance and American hegemony. The LIO is better understood as a core-periphery order because inequality between the Western-core and the \u2018Restern\u2019-periphery was constitutive of it. (Re-)Imperialism\u2014not just liberalism\u2014remained a central ordering mechanism well after 1945. I show the two-way deep contestations between the liberal and anticolonial ordering projects, especially at the 1955 Bandung Conference. Contra the post-LIO pessimism of disorder/chaos, I argue that the normative agency of the Southeast Asian states informed by the legacy of Bandung is heralding a multiplex, multi-regional world order. As the declining inequality between the West and Asia transforms the core-periphery LIO, the emergent decentered world order will lack a core, whether Western/liberal or Asian. This deep transformation should be welcomed, not deeply contested, although coexistence and global integration require embracing deep pluralism, not liberalism.\nManjeet S. Pardesi is Associate Professor of International Relations in the Political Science and International Relations Programme, and Asia Research Fellow at the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. His research interests include World Orders and World/Global History, Great Power Politics, Asian security, and the Sino-Indian rivalry.

    "long_description": "The myth of the Minotaur is a tale almost as old as storytelling itself, but with The Monster in the Maze Jonathan Dove and Alisdair Middleton have excavated rich, new life from this classic. In this brand new staging by director Anapela Polataivao (Red White and Brass, Wild Dogs Under My Skirt), this story will be told as never before.\n\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he metes out his punishment in the cruellest way possible: by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth, to be fed to the terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze: the Minotaur. As King Minos triumphs, his great monster \u201cwill eat your future, it will rip your hope, it will stamp your youth, your children in the sand.\u201d\n\nAs the vindictive king will soon learn, however, these youth will not accept their fate without a fierce challenge. The Monster in the Maze is a story about resistance; about justice; about finding power not in oppression, but in collectivism. Fittingly, then, it\u2019s also a groundbreaking work in its form: a community-focused and community-driven opera in which young and community singers and players stand proudly shoulder-to-shoulder with their professional counterparts, and in which both are integral.\n\nThe Monster in the Maze has been roundly praised by audiences, participants and reviewers worldwide, and in its Aotearoa debut season, it will serve as a gorgeous articulation of New Zealand Opera\u2019s reciprocal community kaupapa.\n\nSung in English with surtitles.",

    "long_description": "Growing attention to staff wellbeing has resulted in many workplace mental wellbeing initiatives. Nevertheless, the concept of staff wellbeing is rarely well-defined, with programs focusing on either work-related stressors or staff wellness approaches.\n\nAs part of a well school, it is just as essential to have a well staff as it is to a well student body. Don't miss out! Discover the key principles of wellbeing and build a sustainable, impactful plan for your staff.\n\nJoin this workshop tailored for schools & kura, exploring how to promote staff wellbeing in 2025. Learn the theory and practice of promoting wellbeing in staff!\nFrom Remedial to Sustainable Action\nProviding resources or assistance programmes to help staff manage job stress is a single element of an extensive staff wellbeing plan. Schools commonly start at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum, creating welfare or wellness plans. Learning the differences between welfare, wellness, and wellbeing approaches, including their strengths and weaknesses, is important.\n\nMeta-evaluations reveal that many workplace mental wellbeing programmes lack efficacy due to not addressing organisational and systemic factors that impact wellbeing. Effective staff wellbeing programmes must respond to staff needs and reflect the school's cultural values and character.\nUtilizing collective impact, transformational change theory, and Te Whare Tapa Wh\u0101, we introduce a conceptual model outlining the eight pillars essential for a staff wellbeing plan. This model's strength lies in its specificity to different settings or occupations, necessitating an in-depth analysis of work nature, dynamics, and inter-relationships.\nBased on insights from past workshops and participant feedback, this workshop now provides a comprehensive template for developing staff wellbeing plans.\nThis workshop does not offer a pre-packaged wellbeing programme. Research indicates that externally imposed wellbeing programmes have limited efficacy in schools. Effective staff wellbeing plans must be rooted in insights gained from reflective analysis and staff consultations. Notably, the consultation process itself is a key wellbeing activity.\nTake the opportunity to hear from an award winning wellbeing specialist about:\nthe wellbeing continuum and the difference between mental illness prevention and wellbeing approaches\nthe key determinants that impact on staff wellbeing\neffective strategies to respond to fatigue, burnout, depression and trauma\nwhy one size doesn't fit all and how to scope and design a staff wellbeing programme responsive to the specific needs of your school\ndeveloping a staff wellbeing programme based on proven wellbeing outcomes\nmaking informed decisions on your school\u2019s staff wellbeing policy and activities\nWorkshop Format:\nThe content will be delivered over two workshops.\nIn-Person 1 day workshop in Wellington\nFriday 31 October 9am to 4pm\nOn-Line Workshop\nWednesday 3 December 1 - 3.30pm\n\nTopics covered in this practical workshop:\nwhat is meant by wellbeing and its role in addressing stress and mental distress in staff;\nthe difference between a welfare and a wellbeing approach;\nstaff wellbeing as an industrial relations / conditions of employment issue\nresilience, coping, thriving? - identifying desired wellbeing outcomes\nthe interface between personal and professional stressors and distressors\nthe impact on staff wellbeing from exposure to trauma and poor mental wellbeing within the student body\nthe key determinants that facilitate wellbeing in the teaching environment\nwhat does and what doesn\u2019t contribute to a supportive environment where staff thrive\nthe key components that should be in a staff wellbeing programme\ndesigning, implementing and evaluating a staff wellbeing programme\nSchool Group Participation\nSchools are encouraged to have more than one staff member participate in the online workshops. Past workshops has shown that having more than one staff member has maximised the benefit of the workshop activities which can then been continued post-workshop. To promote school group participation, there is a 20% discount off the total registration fee when three or more participants per school are registered.\nWho should attend: \nSenior leadership team members (especially those with responsibility of staff wellbeing)\nOHS representatives or union delegates\nHeads of Departments\nBoards of Trustees representatives\nSchool Counsellors / EAP providers\nIn-House Delivery:\nThis workshop can also be delivered in-house, school clusters, or organisations such as prinicpal assocations or unions. Post workshop consulting services such as mentoring the development of or reviewing a staff wellbeing plan can also be provided.\nPost Workshop Consult:\nSchools and Kuras have the option of a 90 minute consult with Barry in 2026 to review their staff wellbeing plan.\nAN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNING WITH INTERNATIONALLY RESPECTED AND AWARD WINNING MENTAL WELLBEING PRACTITIONER AND SUICIDOLOGIST, BARRY TAYLOR\nBarry has worked in mental wellbeing promotion and suicide prevention/postvention for 37 years at the local, national and international levels.

It is common for schools to start their development of their plan at the remedial end of the wellbeing continuum. Consequently the plan developed is more a welfare / wellness plan.

Insights that very few others trainers or training programs in this country provide. He has had an interest on the impact of social exclusion, alienation and discrimination on mens's wellbeing and advocates for a human rights based, systems change and person-centred approach to wellbeing.The workshop is enriched by the learnings from Barry's own lived experience of depression and suicidality and his pathway to recovery.\nAfter a number of years overseas, Barry is living back in New Zealand and is passionate about building the knowledge base, competence and capability within our country to effectively respond to the unacceptably high rate of male suicide in this country.\n\nWORKSHOP DETAILS\nWORKSHOP PLACES ARE LIMITED.

In Eddie Izzard \u2014 The Remix: The First 35 Years, she reimagines some of her favourite comedy highlights.

    "description": "What might have happened if Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet had ended differently?\n& Juliet explores the idea of what the Bard\u2019s heroine might have done if she\u2019d lived beyond the end of the play.\nThe result is a fabulous, feel-good journey of self-discovery, empowerment, and second chances.\nIt features chart-toppers like Since U Been Gone, Roar, Baby One More Time, Larger Than Life, and Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling!\nThe retelling of a classic love story through a bold new lens makes & Juliet more than just a musical."
