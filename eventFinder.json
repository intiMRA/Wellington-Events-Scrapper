    "description": "The next concert in our series presents a new project by Dave Wilson titled Free, Free: Meditations on Liberation. This project brings together a collective of musicians from across the music communities of P\u014dneke in an invitation to explore the expansive possibilities for what liberation might sound like.\n\nFree, Free draws from legacies of musical collectivity, and celebrates a commitment to both collaboration and the distinct expression of each individual.\n\nRanging from contemplative minimalism to ecstatic ensemble energy and body-moving grooves, the music of Free, Free invites musicians and other listeners to tend to each moment, making their own offerings to shape the collective sound.\n\nDave Wilson is a saxophonist, clarinettist, composer, producer, and interdisciplinary scholar. His music bridges avant-garde and experimental music with various groove-oriented styles from the worlds of jazz, R&B, electronic music, and more. With his 2023 album Ephemeral, described as \u201cquite spiritually intense music\u201d by The Guardian, he was a finalist for Te Manu Taki Tautito o te Tau | Best Jazz Artist at the Aotearoa Music Awards, and for the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award. Before relocating to Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington in 2016, Dave grew up in the Chicago area, lived for a decade in Los Angeles, and spent several stints living in Skopje, North Macedonia.\n\nFree, Free: Meditations on Liberation:\nDave Wilson, Tyaan Singh \u2013 alto saxophone\nLouisa Williamson \u2013 tenor saxophone\nMonique Lapins, Mana Waiariki \u2013 violin\nKen Ichinose \u2013 cello\nKaito Walley, Natania Ngawhau \u2013 trombone\nBen Hunt \u2013 trumpet\nDaniel Hayles, Andrew Faleatua \u2013 piano and keyboard\nPhoebe Johnson \u2013 bass\nCallum Allardice \u2013 guitar\nHikurangi Schaverien-Kaa \u2013 drums\n\nThe performance will begin with an opening set by Flute Journeys, an offbeat mass flute ensemble with the self-described playing abilities of 5\u201312-year-olds, embodying a form of liberation in music.\n\nThe Jazz Orchestra Composer Series showcases original music for large jazz ensemble by New Zealand composers. Concerts take place every 1st and 3rd Friday of the month, from May to October, from 7pm. Tickets are $15 from Humanitix, door sales $20.\n\nThanks to CNZ for their generous support. See less"

Breath patterns may switch from abdominal breathing to breathing combined with speech sounds.\nMovements are typically gentle and smooth, aimed for relaxation.\nMind regulation includes focusing one\u2019s attention and visualization.\nDynamic (active) qigong techniques primarily focus on body movements, especially movements of the whole body or arms and legs. Meditative (passive) qigong techniques can be practiced in any posture that can be maintained over time and involve breath and mind exercises, with almost no body movement.\nWear loose, comfortable clothing and bring a bottle of water.\n\n[This is a physical activity that involves an element of risk.

We\u2019re performing pieces by composers, arrangers, and lyricists from the wider Wellington area whose work deserves to be heard more often.\n\nWe begin with tributes to two influential figures we\u2019ve lost: Jenny McLeod and lyricist Shirley Murray. Then we move into works by people we\u2019ve sung with, worked with, and deeply admire. Rosemary Russell contributes three pieces. Jonathan Berkahn, who played organ at our last concert, has two featured works: a Nunc Dimittis and Magnificat.\n\nCadence Chung, recipient of our 2023 K\u0101piti Chorale Performance Award, returns to sing with us, this time performing her own composition for voice, flute, and piano, as well as joining the choir for other pieces. We're glad to have her back.\n\nOur director Eric Sidoti brings a new arrangement of a song by Six60, adding a fresh and familiar note to the evening.\n\nWe\u2019ll close with Mass in E Minor by Thomas Nikora, another musician we\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with. Thomas sang in the choir at a previous concert and has accompanied some of our rehearsals, and now we\u2019re performing his Mass with the largest choir to present it to date. It\u2019s a bold, expressive work that shows the depth and versatility of a composer equally at home performing, conducting, and writing music. We\u2019re proud to be singing it.\n\nJoin us on Saturday 9 August at 4 PM at St Paul\u2019s Church, Paraparaumu.\nThis concert starts one hour later than usual. Bring a friend, enjoy a winter afternoon of music, and help us fill the church. These are works we believe in, and we can\u2019t wait to share them with you.\n\nMusic Director: Eric Sidoti\nAssistant Music Director: Ann-Marie Stapp\nSoprano Solo: Cadence Chung\nFlute: Malu Jonas\nPiano: Phillip O\u2019Malley\n\nDate: Saturday 9 August 2025\nTime: 4:00 PM\nVenue: St Paul\u2019s Church, Kapiti Road, Paraparaumu\n\nPrinted tickets will soon be available from Moby Dickens\u2019 (Paraparaumu Beach), Jenoa (Waikanae), and Books & Co (\u014ctaki), or by emailing tickets@kapitichorale.org.nz or calling (021) 261 2749."

Princess Chelsea\u2019s Midwinter Ball returns, this year with a new theme: SWORDS AND SORCERY - Fantasy on The Big Screen. With your esteemed host comedian Tom Sainsbury, and live performances from Princess Chelsea & The Dream Warriors in both centres, with Auckland guests The Circling Sun & Golden Axe, while Wellington will be treated to sets from Grecco Romank & Luke Buda.\n\nIn the shimmering and VHS-heavy age of the early 1980s, a treasure trove of cinematic fantasy was thrust upon us. Gleaming swords and potent spells in Excalibur, the ethereal beauty and terror of Legend, valiant quests of The Sword and The Sorcerer, Ladyhawke, The Beastmaster, Willow, Dragonslayer, and the mighty & muscular quests of Conan The Barbarian. And let us not forget the timeless enchantments of pure fantasy with The Neverending Story, the delightful Princess Bride, the poignant Last Unicorn, and the unforgettable shape of Labyrinth.\n\nSo, brave adventurers, will you join us to celebrate this golden age? How will you dress to impress as visions of enchanted lands and heroic feats conjure a costume fit for fantasy?\n\nCalled by many as \u2018the show of 2024\u2019, last year\u2019s Twin Peaks themed Midwinter Ball was a revelation, and a dress up party for the ages. A sold out Wintergarden heaved with 650 guests dressed as Log Ladies, Agent Dale Coopers, and even a giant slice of cherry pie\u2026 and oh, so much more.\n\nPrincess Chelsea and her band The Dream Warriors delighted the audience with a blazing set of originals alongside covers of Julee Cruise, Angelo Badalamenti and In Heaven from Lynch\u2019s Eraserhead. This wild and unforgettable night has been lovingly captured and presented as a four song tribute to David Lynch, due for imminent release.\nFor 2024\u2019s Twin Peaks-themed ball, no expenses were spared on transforming the venue into the quaint town of Twin Peaks. Decoration which featured lasers, an indoor pine forest, a shrine to Laura Palmer and a replica of the infamous Red Room, we can only expect magic and mystery from 2025\u2019s fantasy- themed ball.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving too much away but obviously we will need a medieval sword fight\u201d - Princess Chelsea\n\nIf last year\u2019s ball was anything to go by, I don't think she is joking - and further shenanigans will undoubtedly ensue. Expect the Civic and Meow Nui to be transformed into a world of fantasy.\n\nEarlybird tickets are on sale Friday at 10am. Book your evening, and swan down the red carpet dressed in your favourite fantasy-inspired outfits. Portraits will be taken on the night, and prizes for best dressed."

Directed by Annabel Hensley\n\nIt is 1918, immediately after the armistice which ended the Great War. Two women struggle to run a small farm in rural England and are moderately content. Their comfortable, albeit unfulfilling lives, are disrupted by two visitors. A fox has begun to take their hens and a young soldier arrives. These seemingly unrelated events combine and clash with unexpected consequences. The play explores the dynamics of power play when instincts are triggered that are as old as life itself.\n\nThe play explores gender roles, sexuality, femininity, and the pity of war, with Scott\u2019s adaptation maintaining the authenticity of Lawrence\u2019s original work."

    "description": "Join us on the first Friday of every month at to AWHI yourself with a 90-minute Yoga Nidra. Unwind from the stresses of the week and the month in a state of relaxation.

It's the perfect way to rejuvenate your mind, body, and soul: your hinengaro, tinana and wairua.\n\nYoga Nidra is a powerful technique that directly works to heal your mind by removing samskaras - untying knots and mental impressions. This practice of learning to relax consciously is well regarded as an antidote for stress, anxiety, poor sleep amongst other health benefits.\n\nWhat to Expect:\n- A 90-minute guided Yoga Nidra Meditation led by one of our experienced instructors\n- A comfortable space to lie down (mats, blankets, bolsters & cushions provided)\n- A supportive community of fellow meditation enthusiasts\n- Complementary herbal tea before/after the session;\n- An opportunity to journal your experience, if desired\n- A chance to destress and cultivate inner calm\n\nYoga Nidra is for everyone and no prior experience is required - everyone is welcome to experience the profound benefits of Yoga Nidra with us.\n\nWear comfortable clothes, and bring an open mind, a journal and eye mask if you have one (not required).\n\nSo, mark your calendar for the first Friday of each month and treat yourself to an evening of deep relaxation and mindfulness.\n\nLet's come together and discover the transformative power of Yoga Nidra Meditation. See you there!"

    "description": "Although some observers are predicting that classical music is losing popularity, the Mulled Wine Concerts organisation in Paekakariki is finding exactly the opposite. Its 2025 season has produced several sell-out events in Kapiti and the organiser, Mary Gow is in a upbeat mood about the next concert in the series. She notes \"The Elouan Quartet who will be appearing at Paekakariki's iconic St Peter's Hall on Sunday July 20th features an outstanding chamber music quartet of principal players from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra who will be accompanied by the very popular principal flautist, Bridget Douglas\".\n\n\n\nThe Elouan Quartet with Bridget Douglas will present a captivating programme of music for flute and string quartet. Highlights include works by Mozart, Beethoven, Ginastera, Amy Beach, and Selina Fisher.These works are paired together in such a way as to compliment and contrast each other. Many of the works have a strong connection to the natural world, especially water, this most essential and beautiful compound that is our very lifeblood. The quartet comprises Jessica Oddie (violin), Anna Van der Zee (violin), Alexander McFarlane (viola} and Ken Ichinose (cello), names that will be familiar to followers of the NZSO. Bridget Douglas (flute) is also a well-known principal member of the orchestra\n\n\n\nAlmost every organisation involved in the arts in New Zealand is finding it tough going in 2025. Commercial sponsorship is very difficult to come by, and the grant-funding bodies are all facing cutbacks. But the demand is still there and Mulled Wine Concerts has found that their policy of presenting top-quality music in local venues and keeping ticket costs down as far as possible, is the right way to go. \"We have had good audiences for our recent events\" says Gow. \"People who think twice about going into the capital and paying high prices for travel and tickets like the idea that they can have good music locally\". With its popular combination of a string quartet and flute, presented by world-class musicians, Kapiti audiences will certainly appreciate the latest event in the series and it is likely to sell out quickly.\n\n\n\n=======ENDS======\n\n\n\nMulled Wine Concerts present: The Elouan Quartet with Bridget Douglas\n\nSunday July 20, 2025 at 2:30PM at St Peter's Community Hall, Beach Road Paekakariki.\n\n\n\nTickets $35 (Student under 16, $15). Online Sales: marygow@gmail.com\n\n\n\nShop outlets: Magpie Paremata, 99 Mana Esplanade; Finn's Hotel, Paekakariki; Moby Dickens Bookshop, Paraparaumu Beach; Jenoa, 2 Mahara Place, Waikanae.\n\n\n\nInfo: www.mulledwineconcerts.com"

The inability to anticipate exactly what the paint will do makes watercolour an exciting medium to work with.\n\nIn this course we will learn to set the conditions for surprising and beautiful accidents to occur on the page. By incorporating these looser abstract elements into representational paintings we can convey heightened emotions in our work.\n\nThroughout the term we will cover the following:\n\n- The wet into wet technique to achieve one of a kind paint interactions.\n- Learn about transparent colour mixing to create luminosity in your paintings.\n- Use marbling to find organic shapes and patterns.\n- Study the relationship between line and colour and the different ways they can be combined to find a personal style.\n- Experiment with composition through collage.\n\nEach class we will look at examples of historic and contemporary painting, and discuss how to selectively incorporate references into your work. Over the term you will build up a visual style and body of work.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new to watercolour or looking to expand your range, this course offers an opportunity to explore the expressive potential of watercolour.\n\nBasic materials included.\n\nMornings:\nWednesdays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n23 July - 10 September.\n\nEvenings:\nMondays, 6-8 m\n21 July - 8 September."

What if the key to manifestation isn\u2019t about effort, but alignment?\n\nThis workshop explores how the wisdom of yoga philosophy can help us shift from the noise of a reactive, conditioned mind into a space of deeper inner alignment. Beyond just rewiring thoughts, yoga offers a map back to the part of us that is steady, clear, and deeply connected \u2014 an inner magnet that draws what is truly nourishing for our growth and transformation.\n\nThrough reflection, and an informed practice, you\u2019ll be invited to consider how tuning inwards can begin to shape your outer reality in more meaningful ways. Whether you're new to yoga philosophy or have walked this path for a while, this session offers a grounded and enriching perspective on the subtle art of manifestation.\n\nMeet your host, Rasesvari\nRasesvari is an events co-ordinator who loves to bring people together and create a warm and memorable experience. She thrives on connection with others and has a deep desire for a lifestyle of yoga, meditation and holistic healing."

You'll work on your project both during class and at home, applying the animation principles to your individualised project.\n\nYou can choose to draw your animation on paper then scan/capture into your device, or choose to draw your animation digitally, directly into an animation programme. which ever you choose, instructions in class will be provided to give you the skills needed for this step.\n\nRoss will advice you on the a variety of animation apps/programmes available online to use, ranging in price from free to not very much.\n\nNote - A computer mouse can be used for 2D animation but digital pens are much easier to use. Prior to the course commencing, you'll receive details of recommended programmes to use for the course.\n\nTuesday evenings, 6:30 - 8:30 pm.\n22 July - 9 September."

    "description": "WJC is excited to announce a special one-off concert featuring Grammy nominated saxophonist, Troy Roberts.\n\nEmbracing his love for a vast variety of stylistic genres, three-time GRAMMY nominated saxophonist, Troy Roberts is quickly becoming one of the most widely recorded touring artists of his time. As a go-to first call saxophonist, his name adorns several essential recordings ranging from the legendary Joey DeFrancesco, the iconic Van Morrison, the quintessential Jeff \"Tain\" Watts, the tireless Orrin Evans\u2019 Captain Black Big Band, the critically acclaimed Kurt Elling, the breathtaking Veronica Swift, including numerous other jazz veterans, and newcomers considered tastemakers of their generation.\n\nThe New York City based Australian immigrant is also a prolific leader with sixteen releases to his name. Currently celebrating his latest, Green Lights (featuring John Patitucci, Paul Bollenback and Jimmy Macbride), Roberts maintains a busy recording and performance schedule with his quartet, his original project Nu-Jive, as well as some of the greatest artists of today. With a busy international schedule, it is not often that Roberts finds time to schedule NZ dates, so this show is not to be missed!\n\nJoining Troy Roberts (tenor saxophone), Duncan Haynes (piano), Seth Boy (acoustic bass), Mark Lockett (drums).\n\nTroy Roberts continues to be a master of styles and configurations with this eminently accessible, sonically and rhythmically engaging session, emitting steam and sumptuous harmonic colors along the way. -Glide Magazine\n\nTickets are also available on Eventfinda and at the door for a masterclass by Troy Roberts at Bedlam & Squalor on 2 August at 4pm."

    "description": "Join us for a powerful evening of music celebrating the legacy of one of jazz\u2019s most visionary artists \u2014 John Coltrane. From his soulful early ballads and hard bop classics to the boundary-pushing spiritual intensity of his later free jazz works, this performance traces the full arc of Coltrane\u2019s musical journey.\n\n\n\nLed by drummer Oscar Garvie, the group is anchored by the expressive and deeply studied playing of saxophonist Isaac Randel, whose sound channels the fire and depth of Coltrane\u2019s voice. Randel brings a commanding front-line presence and a profound connection to the material, making him the perfect interpreter of Coltrane\u2019s vast and evolving musical language.\n\n\n\nThe band also features Jack Harris on bass and Tane Kelly on piano \u2014 a dynamic rhythm section that navigates the full emotional and sonic range of Coltrane\u2019s music.\n\n\n\nTogether, this quartet dives into every era of Coltrane\u2019s work \u2014 from the lyrical beauty of Naima and the modal mastery of Impressions, to the raw, transcendent fire of Ascension and Interstellar Space. This tribute isn\u2019t just a look back \u2014 it\u2019s a living, breathing expression of what Coltrane\u2019s music still means\n\nMusic from 9pm, FREE ENTRY"

Therefore, we announce with great pleasure that noted historian\u202fDame Claudia Orange DNZM OBE CRSNZ\u202fwill present our opening lecture in this series, which focuses on the history of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the Waitangi Tribunal.\n\nEncouraging discussion on the Treaty of Waitangi is a vital part of continuing efforts to fulfil the promise of the 1840 agreement. Dame Claudia argues that a broad public understanding of the changes that have occurred in the M\u0101ori\u2013Crown relationship is essential in order for those relationships to grow. She says that an understanding of history is vital, and informed vigilance is necessary.\n\nTickets are $35 per session, or $25 for students and SuperGold Card holders, and include one drink and light kai. Doors open 5:30pm. The exhibition\u202fHe Kura Toi Tangata: 50 Years of The Waitangi Tribunal will remain open to view until 8pm.\n\nTe\u202fWaka\u202fHuia Wellington Museum\n\nWednesday 6 August | 6pm \u2013 8pm\n\nTickets $25\u2013$35 | Book tickets: https://bit.ly/4lgFb0F"

She was often one of the boys, hidden behind a flak jacket. Yet, beneath her tough exterior, she was battling excruciating pain from endometriosis, taking 15 painkillers a day to cope with the burning and stabbing sensations in her uterus. But Susie\u2019s story is more than just physical pain\u2014it's about surviving the harsh realities that many women face, including misogyny, discrimination, and the often dismissive attitudes of a healthcare system ill-equipped to address women's needs.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to hear from one of New Zealand's most respected journalists discuss the importance of resilience, self-advocacy, and finding the courage to share our stories.\nMrs Blackwell\u2019s Village Bookshop will be selling copies of 'Bloody Minded' on the night and Susie will sign your copies after the event."

    "description": "Grab a spot on our couch and enjoy the noise at The Racket Lounge, a chill classical music series featuring up-and-coming P\u014dneke classical and jazz musicians.\n\nLast year the NZSQ Trust launched the Racket Lounge, a concert series for classical and jazz musicians with experience ranging from students to pros to freely express their creativity in a non-traditional concert setting. It was a huge success, with over 250 audience members and 52 artists over our four sessions. Audiences were raving about the musical variety and great talent they found at the Racket Lounge, and as one audience member commented; \u201cWell done\u2026do it again!\u201d So, we listened, and the Racket Lounge is back for round two! Once again hosted at Bedlam & Squalor (above the Rogue & Vagabond), we welcome audiences, composers and performers back for another four concerts full of innovative, fun, and chill music. From classical to pop covers, video game soundtracks to original compositions, there's something for everyone to sink their teeth into at The Racket Lounge!\n\nEven if you've never been to a classical music concert before, this one is for you. With a 'Choose your price' model you can afford to give it a go - and you might even find something you like!\n\nA Flexible Price, So You Can Take A Chance on Something New:\nOur prices range from $5 to $100, just pick the ticket price you feel like paying. At The Racket Lounge, we believe everyone should have access to high-quality but affordable art. If you're a bit strapped for cash right now, but still want a good night out, no worries! Just book yourself a $5 ticket! If you can afford to pay a little more and want to do some good for your community, then pick one of our higher ticket prices and rest assured that your dollars are going towards funding great, accessible art in your city.\n\nAll proceeds from ticket sales will go directly into presenting the next Racket Lounge, including paying musicians and artists, hiring instruments and marketing costs. Plus, by choosing a higher price point, you're ensuring that we're able to continue to offer tickets at a lower price point for those who need it.\n\nPlease note: Bedlam & Squalor is a licenced venue, so under 18s must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Everyone must bring ID."

    "description": "In this course you will examine structural drawing with a careful helpful approach, focusing on simple perspective drawing and the value of geometric shapes and solids. Both these structural approaches contribute greatly to the success of your drawing.\n\nGeometric shapes can simplifying a subject, unify a drawing and make compositions dynamic. Geometric solids will help render any subject in three dimensions and transition to perspective.\n\nA good working knowledge of the concepts of perspective will help you draw any subject with correct dimensionality. It can also help in your realist drawing, painting and invented subjects and environments. These concepts are also used in most two dimensional art because it enables us to realise great spatial effects, making it an invaluable tool to add to your skill set.\n\nIn this course you will learn the following:\n\n- Focus on geometric shapes and solids and how they contribute to both realist and abstract drawing\n- Form an appreciation of geometry and shapes that can help with constructing a drawing\n- The important tools, methods and concepts of one-point, two-point and three-point perspective\n- Universal boxing, drawing ellipses\n- Hints in locating helpful lines and axis to draw real subjects\n- Introductory methods of working that blend perspective knowledge with real drawing situations\n\nAll basic materials supplied.\n\nWednesday evenings, 6:30 - 8:30 pm, 23 July - 10 September.\nOR\nFriday mornings, 10 am - 1 pm, 25 July - 12 September."

    "description": "Programme\n\nBeethoven: Piano Trio, Opus 70, No 1 \"The Ghost\"\nTakemitsu: Between Tides\nGlen Downie: Sonata da chiesa\nShostakovich: Piano Trio No 2, Opus 67\n\n\nThe Ghost Trio will perform in Waikanae as part of a Chamber Music New Zealand tour. Popular New Zealand musicians Monique Lapins (violin), Ken Ichinose (cello) and pianist Gabriela Glapska are all familiar faces on the Waikanae stage, having appeared with numerous other chamber ensembles. They have named their group after the work they are about to perform on this tour - Beethoven's Opus 70, No 2 trio which is known as \"The Ghost\" because of the eerie, ominous sounds in the gloomy second movement. The two outer movements are much brighter, the first bold and energetic, the third witty and playful.\n\nTwo brief and contrasting works complete the first half of this varied concert. Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu has been acclaimed as the most important composer in Japanese musical history. His piece \"Between Tides\" illustrates his great love of nature. New Zealand composer Glen Downie's new work (being premiered on this tour) was inspired by the simplicity of Vivaldi\u2019s cello sonatas and the baroque form known as sonata da chiesa.\n\nThe second half of the concert will be dominated by one of the greatest piano trios of the 20th Century - Shostakovich's Opus 67. Written in 1944 amid World War II, the trio responds to the conflicts of those times, but also to the composer's personal circumstances. It is an elegy for the tragic victims of war, but also expresses Shostakovich's grief at the sudden death of his closest friend and mentor Ivan Ivanovich Sollertinsky. The opening movement is bleak and despairing, followed by a lively, almost obsessive Scherzo. The third movement is a starkly beautiful funeral dirge while the last movement brings together themes from the previous movements, also introducing new Russian and Jewish themes.\n\nDoor sales will be available for this concert or tickets can be bought from Waikanae New World and Moby Dickens Books in Paraparaumu Beach. Ticket enquiries can be made at 022 345 5316 or from the society's website www.waikanaemusic.org.nz\n\nThe Ghost Trio concert is presented as part of Chamber Music New Zealand\u2019s \"In Partnership Series\"."

These miniature altars are made inside small tins and can be dedicated to someone or something meaningful to you. It could be in memory of a loved one, in honour of a favourite artist, pet, place, or even a whimsical nod to the faeries. Anything goes.\n\nPocket shrines are designed to be carried with you or kept close. You might keep yours on your desk, in your bag, or tucked in your pocket to bring comfort, inspiration, or connection wherever you go.\n\nWe\u2019ll have everything you need to bring your shrine to life, including collage materials, fabric scraps, buttons, beads, and more. If you\u2019d like to make a shrine in memory of someone special, you are welcome to bring a small photo of them to include.\n\nThis event is part of Takurua Hauora: Winter Wellness, a Wellington event series promoting health and wellbeing inspired by Sir Mason Durie\u2019s Whare Tapa Wh\u0101 model.\n\nSuitable for ages 12+.\n\nSaturday 2 August | 2pm\u20134pm | $15 per person | Te Waka Huia Wellington Museum"

Carol Bean \u2013 vocals and guitar, Costa Botes \u2013 guitar(s), George Packard \u2013 upright bass, and Andrew Grayson \u2013 drums. \nEnglish-born, California-raised, Carol was influenced by the West Coast music of the 60s and the blues of Mississippi John Hurt, Mance Lipscomb, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, and Doc Watson. At LA\u2019s Ash Grove and McCabe\u2019s Music Store she was taught her picking style from a young Ry Cooder who encouraged her to buy the Martin guitar she still plays today. Carol has fronted several bands in New Zealand and recorded 3 studio albums, all on Spotify. She continues to perform at the Wellington Roomfulla Blues Club and with the Kelburn Viaduct Municipal Ensemble Jug Band.\n\"Carol\u2019s singing is versatile, vibrant, and delivers an earthy quality to her songs.\" Tom Villano, LA\n\"\u2026 when the mood drops she reveals a more intimate, reflective side\u2026.\" Graham Reid\n\"The first three songs of Next Bus Out perfectly set the album up for the interesting  journey that is to come.\" Nick Bollinger.\nCosta is a veteran independent filmmaker with several award winning short films and feature length documentaries to his credit, including the notorious \u2018mock doc\u2019 Forgotten Silver, which he made with Peter Jackson. For the last two decades he has created a run of films celebrating individuals who are quirky, creative, passionate, and above all, persistent (Struggle No More, The Last Dogs of Winter, Act of Kindness, Angie, When The Cows Come Home).  These films have included studies of musicians (Paddy Burgin's Wooden Box Band, Nigel Gavin\u2019s Circus, and The Shot Band/ Hobnails @ The Paramount Theatre) because Costa has been a persistent closet musician himself. He has had stints with Chris and Eva Prowse, and Carol Bean's Mount Misery String Band. When he was younger, Costa wanted to move his fingers really fast. Now he just tries to put them in the right place, song by song, and man - does he ever. \u201cTasty\u201d, \u201cAmazing\u201d, \u201cGreat playing\u201d.\nSee Costa Botes | NZ On Screen & Costa Botes Lone Pine Films (vimeo.com)\nGeorge is a professional musician and tutor on Whitireia Polytechnic\u2019s Music Programme, trained classically on the cello. George\u2019s first improvisational experiences were playing ukulele along with the Rolling Stones, John Mayall and The Band (in his bedroom).  With little market for improvisational ukulele he took up the double bass.\nGeorge enjoys playing in bands that push the envelope and give expression to the human soul. He has played extensively in many Wellington groups (including currently with the Rag Poets band), appearing a number of times for the Wellington International Festival of the Arts, undertaking national tours for Chamber Music New Zealand, and backing overseas artists in New Zealand. His playing ranges from classical to jazz, to Latin, to ethnic fusion to Americana and country. He believes - at a fundamental level - that music is about human beings making sense of the world and themselves, and about helping heal the world.\nAndrew is also the drummer for the band Ghostplane (Beneath the Sleepy Lagoon; Panther Valley Country Club (Arch Hill Records), which includes Phoenix Foundation members). Not only has he joined our team, but his passion is surfing - so let's say he's the youngest and the fittest.\nNot for profit, supporting our dedicated musicians. Suggested donation $30\nCome along and enjoy this gig in our special space, up close and personal.\nTeas, Coffee and Snacks provided. You're welcome to bring anything you'd like to eat or drink.\nParking available in the Coupon zones of Upland Rd & Glasgow St free after 6pm weekdays, and free all through the weekends. The Wilson Carpark at the top of the Cable Car charges 24/7."

Armed with new releases and a reckless lack of MIDI cables, longtime pals Synthetic Children and Diesel Jenny are packing gear into the whip for a trip up and down the motu. The six-date tour will see the pair serve up their respective dishes in P\u014dneke on Thursday the 17th of July, alongside ethereal favourite Ekho Laliah.\n\nVia hardware synths and drum machines, Synthetic Children (Te Papaioea\u2019s Celina Goacher) is bringing bubbly synths, auto-tuned vulnerabilities, and sub-rattling beats. Her latest Smooch EP, and appearance on the Big Fresh Collective\u2019s Footmahi compilation, show an emerging fun side to her dancefloor arsenal, following the murky weight of 2023\u2019s Everything\u2019s Perpetual. Donnys worldwide have heralded the new release as a \u201cfreshly cooked 3 course meal, served up by Palmy\u2019s premier snack pack herself\u201d. Think wonky hyperpop with plenty of low end.\n\nDiesel Jenny\u2019s (P\u014dneke\u2019s Josh Finegan) live set will blend brain-breaking breaks with sugar-rush synths and 3D club energy years. This tour will celebrate the inaugural release of Diesel Jenny\u2019s white label series with a rock-solid RUC-exempt two-tracker.\n\nWith multiple releases on underground mainstays Big Fresh Collective and Bankrupt Records as ABG, this isn\u2019t the first time Diesel Jenny\u2019s revved the engine.\n\nEkho Laliah is an Aotearoa based artist who stitches together elements of dream pop, freak folk, and ethereal electronica into sonic tapestries with experimental production as the backbone.\n\nTickets $15 through UTR or $20 at the door"

    "description": "The poems in Biggs Family Prize in Poetry winner Nafanua Purcell Kersel\u2019s Black Sugarcane can sting and soothe, revealing a paradise despoiled by climate change and colonisation, and celebrating a people resilient in the face of it all. Mikaela Nyman is from the autonomous, demilitarised \u00c5land Islands in Finland. Her first poetry collection in English, Anatomy of Sand, follows on from her climate fiction novel Sado. These two urgent contemporary voices join Tamara Tulitua in a conversation about rising seas, political and personal poetry, the local and global.\n\nWriters on Mondays is presented with the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Circa Theatre and Phantom Billstickers National Poetry Day, and is supported by the Letteri Family."
