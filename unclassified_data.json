Last month was intense, and we love intensity, but felt the need to bring it down. The focus for this month is calm. Chill. Relaxation. This is truly going to be the most gentle Airhorn you have seen.\nThere will be no flashing lights or threat of epilepsy. There will not be loud noises or gross out humour. There will not be airhorns! This is not a bit. We are sincerely concerned that folks are going to come to think this is a goof and expect the usual madcap, abrasive chaos of our comedy show.\nThere will be no abrasion. There will be no chaos. We are wanting to do the most experimental show we can do, which in our case is a low-key, cozy, warm-hearted hour of quiet reflection and gentle comedy.This is going to be a soft show for everyone who needs a minute to just breathe. You will laugh, but not enough to hurt your side or upset your neighbor. It will be a laugh held in the liminal space between a deep breath and a long sigh.\nFor folks in which this amount of calm is too stressful, we will also have a Stimulation Booth (provided by Wattie's) available at any time to provide the classic Airhorn jolt they need.

Superior Donuts by Tracy Letts, Stagecraft presents: \u201cSuperior Donuts\u201d\nBy Tracy Letts\nDirected by James Kiesel\n26 November \u2013 6 December 2025\n\u201cWhat could be more human, than to be scared, and keep it a secret.\u201d\nArthur Przybyszewski (that's (p)Shub-er-shef-ski), is the proprietor of a modest, behind-the-times donut shop in uptown Chicago. He can't seem to find joy in anything these days, not even the donuts he used to take such pride in making by hand. Vandals armed with spray paint, predatory landlords, and that nefarious Starbucks down the road all threaten to unceremoniously snuff out the only thing he's got left.\nThat is, until an upstart, ambitious young man shoulders his way into becoming a Superior Donuts employee, and an unlikely friendship (or is it a rivalry?) develops, inspiring both to face the demons they've been hiding from all this time.\nThis is a sharp-witted, heartfelt comedy by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts (\u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d) offering a warm and wry take on depression, diversity, and bravery that will leave you feeling all fluffy and sugary on the inside. Plus, who knows, you might get a donut!\nGo to the Stagecraft website to book your spot!\nhttps://www.stagecraft.co.nz/auditions\nAUDITIONS:\nAuditions will be on Saturday 13th & Sunday 14th September, with callbacks the evening of Monday 15th September.\nTo book an audition, please fill out the form by 10th September - we'll be in touch to confirm your audition date, time and location. If you have any questions please get in touch at auditions@stagecraft.co.nz.\nRoles (just try your best with accents, coaching available once casting is complete)\nArthur Przybyszewski [Male, Polish, 50s - 60s]\nThe owner and operator of Superior Donuts. Old, grumpy, and more than a little depressed. Secretly an artisan and a scholar, he\u2019s spent his whole life running from conflict. Until now? [Has a scene involving some violence]\nFranco Wicks [Male, African-American, 20s]\nYoung, idealistic, a little pushy, and full of attitude and energy. Franco believes that good things will happen to him despite all odds, and evidence, to the contrary. A former employee of Luther.\nMax [Male, Russian, 40s - 60s]\nOwner of the DVD shop next door, Max is interested in buying Superior Donuts to expand his (tiny) capitalist empire. Fancies himself a self-made man. [Speaks in a Russian accent, along with some dialogue in Russian]\nRandy [Female, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nRaised in the middle of 7 brothers and working as a cop in the Chicago Police Department, Randy\u2019s always been \u2018one of the boys\u2019. Big hockey fan. Has a soft spot for Arthur.\nJames [Male, African-American, 30s - 40s]\nAnother cop with the Chicago Police Department and Randy\u2019s beat partner. Well-respected in the community and [not so] secretly a giant Star Trek nerd. [Will consider any and all BIPOC actors for this role]\nLady [Female, Irish-American, 60s - 70s]\nLikely homeless and definitely a little hard-of-hearing, Lady is a well-known as a confusing-but-likeable, perhaps even mascot-like figure in the Uptown community. Well past the point of giving a crap about what other people think.\nLuther [Male, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nLocal bookie and crime-syndicate everyman, Luther has scratched out his living taking money from gambling addicts, which he finds troubling because he\u2019d like to consider himself a good, fair man. Has a stomach ulcer which is probably somehow representative of this inner conflict. [Has a scene involving some violence]\nKevin [Male, Irish, 20s]\nAnother of Luther\u2019s employees, Kevin\u2019s probably fallen into the wrong crowd as a young man, but it doesn\u2019t seem to trouble him that much. Seems to care mostly about getting paid and drinking Coca-Cola.\nKiril [Male, Russian, 20s - 30s]\nA shy man of few words (mostly \u2018hello\u2019), Kiril is an intimidating figure with a big soft heart beating beneath his tall muscular frame. Brought into the fold to be a construction worker and bodyguard, he\u2019s mostly interested in falling in love with the local bartender. [Most dialogue is in Russian] ",

    "description": "Box of Birds, Hailed as \"the cutest little show in Aotearoa\" (Hamilton Arts Festival 2024), award-winning theatre company Birdlife Productions have created this gorgeous theatre show designed especially for ages 4 to 9 years, Including exquisite puppetry, live interactive songs, projection and the teaching of a waiata, this work reflects our transformative connection to nature. Peter is reluctant to stay with nanna in the school holidays because she lives in the country and doesn't have a TV but Nanna finds ways to engage Peter in her love of the forest, especially the precious manu, when they build a nesting box for Ruru together. Peter is excited to see if Ruru will make her home in the box, waiting patiently while many other birds arrive to check out the box first! And after all that waiting, Nanna takes Peter on an exciting night time forest walk to find Ruru - in the dark! The bird characters are all familiar New Zealand locals, such as piwakawaka, kereru, tui and ruru, and the story highlights the importance of supporting them and the different needs they may have. Teachers and Parents have been ecstatic about this show and hundreds of New Zealand children have been transfixed by it.\nAs quoted by Theatreview: \u201cThis is truly a New Zealand show for New Zealand children and all those young-at-heart\u201d.",

A lot has happened to Wayne over the last 10 years. He has retired, his son has moved to London with his grandchildren and Maggie, his wife of 49 years, passed away suddenly a year ago. For Wayne, his family and his work were his life. They were the source of his life's pleasure and purpose and now he is having to cope with the loss of both.\n\nThe only thing left to take his mind off the pain is cycling with his MAMIL friends, especially Bryan, the central character of MAMIL. But a panic attack mid-ride and a crash with catastrophic consequences leads to a crisis of cycling confidence and the inability to do the thing he loves the most.\n\nLike MAMIL, it takes an array of characters to help the central character rediscover what is truly important when their life seems adrift and meaningless.

And this time, it's going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa. Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you're a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show digs deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, family, and the undeniable need to keep moving\u2014no matter how creaky your knees may be.\n\nGet ready to laugh, reflect, and maybe even wince in recognition as GOMIL pedals its way across the country this spring.

Nothing is ever so simple.\n\nThis genre-defying work of dance, theatre, live film, clown and absurd philosophising takes the idea of the \u2018trigger warning\u2019 to its absurdist extreme to question how \u2018informed\u2019 consent can really be, and asking \u2018How much do you really want to know?\u2019\n\nCreated and performed by multi-award-winning maverick of the stage, Eliza Sanders, Manage Your Expectations helps us to see the limits of the power to communicate and our failures to say what we mean. Through movement, multimedia, and razor-sharp wit, it examines the impossibility of perfect communication, musing on the influence of context, identity and personal history while creating something beautiful from our collective mess.\n\n\"Clever, witty, evocative, subversive, immersive, despairing, poignant, personal and universal\" \u2014 Deirdre Tarrant, Theatreview, 2024\n\n\"Beautifully vulnerable\" - Chloe Jaques, Theatreview, 2024\n\nFull of vigour, energy, chaos and a hint of confrontation, Manage Your Expectations is a mind (and body) bending show about how we connect in an increasingly complex world. And you decide the ending\u2026\n\nContent warning: this show contains explicit content, mild coarse language, heavy nudity, themes of abortion and rape.\n\nWINNER: Best Performer, Whang\u0101rei Fringe 2024\nWINNER: Outstanding Solo Performance, NZ Fringe 2024\nWINNER: San Diego Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Best in Fringe, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Innovative Work, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Sydney Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Auckland Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Melbourne Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Adelaide Tour Ready, NZ Fringe 2024\nNOMINATION: Most Original Production, Wellington Theatre Awards 2024\n\nPresented by House of Sand in association with TAHI New Zealand Festival of Solo Performance.\n\nYou decide the ending\u2026\n\n",

The installation brings together the practices of Justine Fletcher, Christine Brimer, and Rita Takeuchi to draw attention to the fleeting essence of daily life, the interplay of absence and presence, and the ever-changing nature of time and memory.\nExperience is always slipping away; time, memory, or an event can only be grasped in their passing, in their trace, or in their absence. Short, intermittent chimes highlight this ephemerality, making duration palpable through moments of presence and absence. Paintings emerge from an attunement to everyday encounters and their emotional resonance, while sculptural and woven forms unravel and shift, emphasising process not as a means to an end, but as a state of becoming. Together, the works suggest that sometimes the only way to \u201chold\u201d something, whether a moment, time, or an atmosphere, is by revealing its impermanence.\n",

The story involves a 'child' (L'enfant) whose awful behaviour brings an unexpected response: first the furniture rebels, the grandfather clock, the broken china cup, then the mathematics tutor and the Princess in the fairy tale book come to life, and eventually all the animals in the garden - squirrels, dragonfly, birds rise up - all of whom have good reason to 'teach the child a lesson'. It's a fabulous journey that we go on with the child who is confronted by all of these and indeed learns...\nThis is a project involving the whole of the Classical Performance programme: the voice students sing all the roles, each performing several roles, the NZSM orchestra will play for the performances, and the piano students are taking part as rehearsal pianists (r\u00e9p\u00e9titeurs) and playing in the orchestra.",

    "description": "The Monster in the Maze, The myth of the Minotaur is a tale almost as old as storytelling itself, but with The Monster in the Maze Jonathan Dove and Alisdair Middleton have excavated rich, new life from this classic. In this brand new staging by director Anapela Polataivao (Red White and Brass, Wild Dogs Under My Skirt), this story will be told as never before.\n\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he metes out his punishment in the cruellest way possible: by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth, to be fed to the terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze: the Minotaur. As King Minos triumphs, his great monster \u201cwill eat your future, it will rip your hope, it will stamp your youth, your children in the sand.\u201d\n\nAs the vindictive king will soon learn, however, these youth will not accept their fate without a fierce challenge. The Monster in the Maze is a story about resistance; about justice; about finding power not in oppression, but in collectivism. Fittingly, then, it\u2019s also a groundbreaking work in its form: a community-focused and community-driven opera in which young and community singers and players stand proudly shoulder-to-shoulder with their professional counterparts, and in which both are integral.\n\nThe Monster in the Maze has been roundly praised by audiences, participants and reviewers worldwide, and in its Aotearoa debut season, it will serve as a gorgeous articulation of New Zealand Opera\u2019s reciprocal community kaupapa.\n\nSung in English with surtitles.",

You\u2019ll see photographs from all around the world \u2013 landscapes, portraits, street scenes, and wildlife \u2013 but the heart of the exhibition is firmly rooted in Wellington. Our members have drawn inspiration from the beauty and variety of our own backyard: dramatic coastlines, majestic mountains, vibrant cities, and the small, fleeting details that make life unique.\nWe are also proud to display images created during our group meet-ups, workshops, and learning sessions.

This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible. A very polished and well-planned course.\u201d Huia Grey, Department of Conservation",

Geometric solids will help render any subject in three dimensions and transition to perspective.\n\nA good working knowledge of the concepts of perspective will help you draw any subject with correct dimensionality. It can also help in your realist drawing, painting and invented subjects and environments. These concepts are also used in most two dimensional art because it enables us to realise great spatial effects, making it an invaluable tool to add to your skill set.\n\n8 x weekly morning or afternoon sessions.

    "description": "Women's Krav Maga Self Defence Intro Night, We believe every woman should feel strong, fearless and confident for life. Krav Maga has proven to be highly empowering for women all around the world. We offer this course to women to learn to deal with women-related challenges, encouraging every woman to overcome anxiety or fear, with confidence, skills and strength.\nKrav Maga is a system that enables a smaller person to effectively disable a larger opponent. We will teach you how to utilise adrenalin and function under stress. It was created to be adaptable and easy to learn, regardless of your size. This makes Krav Maga perhaps the most suitable self-defence training for women today. Apart from the physical training, we will also train you to develop mental resilience, street tactics, confidence, positive self image, and empower you for life.\nIn an ideal world, women would not need to learn to protect themselves. However, until some deeply ingrained societal problems are resolved, it is smart and necessary to have some skills to be able to look after yourself and loved ones with. In the meantime, we encourage every women to approach this training with personal development, personal growth, enjoyment and empowerment being the motivating purpose.\nWe understand women often prefer to train in a women's class. This is our Women's (13+) class called ROAR.\nThese classes are about empowering you for life. Beginning in 2018, this program was created to provide a safe, holistic and supportive class where women can experience empowerment through our training. You will learn to find your voice, your confidence, your inner strength and resolve, while learning physical skills such as how to escape and overpower an assailant, counter grabs, abduction attempts, chokes, hair grabs, pushing and shoving, being hit, being pinned to the ground and sexual assault attempts. We will help you unleash your protective feminine fighting spirit\nThe Intro Night is the ideal time for women interested in the Women's Class to try a class first, see how we train, who we are, and gain some valuable basic skills, before deciding to join the full course. (Note: School Term 4, 2025 is 11 weeks long). No cost to attend the Intro Night.\nPlease email contact@tacticalsurvival.co.nz to enquire or book your spot.\nMore Info: www.tacticalsurvival.co.nz/womens\nAfter Intro, classes run every Wednesday night 7:00pm - 8:00pm (Thistle Hall Cuba St) ",

They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Pacific style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and effective insights. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from different communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from Together in Dialogue?\nIn Together in Dialogue, you will share meaningful conversations around Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the role and responsibilities of Pasifika as allies. By engaging in deep talanoa, you will explore cultural, historical, and contemporary implications of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and how Pasifika people can strengthen this unique relationship and promote cultural awareness.\nThis is a 3 hour in-person learning experience.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\nFacilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives.

    "description": "You Spot It You Got It: Unpacking cultural conditioning and turning the mirror inwards, Talanoa Tai Learning is a new collection of learning experiences. They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Pacific style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and effective insights. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from different communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from You Spot It, You Got It?\nIn You Spot It, You Got It, you will deepen self-awareness by being encouraged to recognise some of your own conditioning and impacts of this in your daily life/practices. When we are not conscious of the things that might not sit right within us then we unknowingly or knowingly project them onto others. What we reject, we project. By examining patterns and recognising our conditioning, then we can truly understand how we can live in more conscious ways. This Talanoa Tai learning experience offers space for talanoa, tools and exercises to facilitate introspection and personal growth by turning the mirror inwards.\nThis is a 3.5 hour in-person learning experience. The day will start with a mihi whakatau to welcome you into the space.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re in social work, education, government, community sectors or beyond, these learning experiences have been designed to help everyone build their skills. If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\nFacilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples. Our team has decades of experience across a range of \ufb01elds, in particular social development, education, and research. We have worked with organisations and businesses across the Paci\ufb01c, and our engagement with di\ufb00erent Paci\ufb01c languages, cultures, and communities means we o\ufb00er robust, informed perspectives. Fa\u2019aeafale\u2019upolu (Polu) Samuelu is the facilitator of this Talanoa Tai Learning experience.",

    "description": "6-12 In person PLD, The story of Communication and Signs is one of the five great stories which scaffold the learning in Montessori classrooms for the 6-12 year old child. It traces the beginnings of human communication and the development of writing.\nHow can we as educators encourage writing in our Montessori environments and ensure collaborations and an understanding of the basic writing processes, bring success and enthusiasm to the telling of powerful stories?\nWhat are some of the stumbling blocks for children when researching? How can we provide strategies and structure to enable lively and informative information writing?\nIn this day-long face to face workshop, with a focus on guidance for narrative and information writing, participants will be invited into the world of learning to write. Strategies and exercises to stimulate interest and action for writers will be given, alongside challenges and advanced crafting lessons for more fluent writers in 6-9 and 9-12 classrooms. We will examine elements of structuring, elaboration, character and place, revision, and author techniques. Note taking and writing for research will be included in an information writing session.\nDay 2: Sunday 14th September\nCome prepared to share your collective wisdom while we align NZC History curriculum to what we do in our classrooms to ensure that everything is covered. By September we will also have a better idea of where the conventional system is headed with the new-look maths coming out. We will spend time unpacking the the WHY we do what we do.\nThis is an opportunity for you to discuss, share ideas and gain ideas for ways forward. ",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.",

These screenings are organised and hosted by the community for the community. More than just a screening, this will be a queer horror experience.\nThe event begins at 3pm but come early to get comfortable. The film will start at 3.30. A short comfort break will be provided. Stay for a drink to discuss and dissect.\nThe Hunger is rated R18. No one under the age of 18 is permitted.

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, 2025 Taiwan Update Lectures\nJoin us for three talks by experts on different aspects of Taiwan\n\nAbout this Event\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\n\n\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\n\n\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 01:00 PM - 02:00 PM\nTaiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nInfo: In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:00 PM - 02:15 PM\nCoffee Break\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:15 PM - 03:15 PM\nWhat does Taiwan's two-level politics tell us?\nInfo: This presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:15 PM - 03:45 PM\nAfternoon Tea\nInfo: Please join us outside AM103 for some light refreshments\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:45 PM - 04:45 PM\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nInfo: This talk explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games.

    "description": "Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal International Order, Abstract\nOver the last decade, China has punished countries that undermine its territorial claims and foreign policy goals with measures such as restricting trade, encouraging popular boycotts, and cutting off tourism. These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods.

Whether you are single or partnered, whether your past experiences were harmonious or painful, each relationship reflects the inner dance of the masculine and feminine within us.\n\nThroughout history, these sacred energies\u2014Yin and Yang\u2014were meant to complement and support each other. Yet, distortions, suppression, and separation have created wounds that echo through generations. Many of us carry beliefs such as:\n\nMen cannot be trusted.\nWomen are not safe.\nLove must be earned.\n......\n\nRarely do we pause to sit with these wounds and meet the unhealed parts of our inner feminine and masculine. These energies may hold not only personal pain but also ancestral imprints passed down through time\u2014shaping the way we experience love and connection today.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f In this mini workshop, you will be guided through a shamanic journey to explore and heal your inner archetypes. Together, we will:\n\n\u2728 Release old wounds and limiting patterns carried by the inner feminine or masculine.\n\u2728 Make peace with the shadow side of our psyche.\n\u2728 Embody the wholeness of the Divine Masculine and Feminine within.\n\nWe will close our circle with a sacred forgiveness ritual, bridging the separation and returning to a state of balance, wholeness, and love.\n\nThis journey is open to everyone\u2014whether you are new to shamanic work or have walked this path before. All that is required is an open heart and willingness to connect deeply within.\n\n\ud83c\udf38 You\u2019ll leave with:\n\nA renewed sense of love and harmony within yourself.\nGreater balance between your inner masculine and feminine.\nA deeper connection to spirit, self, and the essence of oneness.\n\nEvent Details\n\ud83d\udcc5 Saturday, September 27th\n\ud83d\udd52 3:00\u20136:00 pm\n\ud83d\udccd Lotus Yoga Centre \u2013 Sanctuary, Paraparaumu\n\ud83d\udcab Energy Exchange: $55 per person\n\ud83c\udf3f Limited to 12 participants\n\n\u2728What to bring:\nA water bottle, journal, cushion or blanket for comfort.\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Rides from Wellington may be arranged\u2014please contact me if needed.Contact: 0272541272\n\nAbout Your Guide - Fery Qiu\n\nI am a Shamanic Healer who is committed to the healing path that help people heal from the core of their being. From suicidal depression to shamanic path, my spirituality is not based on how many trainings, meditations, and ceremonies I have done, it\u2019s coming from a deep embodied experience to transform pain into wisdom and empowerment. The shamanic path is a way of being; we allow ourselves to go deeper within to connect all things that come from oneness. I loved my work, which has been proven to help people really change their lives. If you are curious about what this mini workshop could bring, having an open mind and open heart, you will be surprised by how much can be done just in this brief journey within.\n\n\n\nWith love,\nFery Qiu\n\n",

    "description": "Book Club: Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, Join us in person to discuss Emiko, a contemporary version of Jane Austen's Emma set in Canada.\n(Order your copy through us by 20 March 2026 for delivery at the 23 May meeting or couriered in NZ)\nAbout Emiko:\nA busybody foodie avoids questions of her own future as she meddles in the love lives of those around her. Has this matcha-maker met her match?\n\nSelf-declared matchmaking GENIUS (a la Beyonce) Emiko Kimori has already found success by helping her aunt find true love, so when the new girl in town becomes her new BFF, it's only natural for Emiko to help set her up for social success with a suitable love match.\n\nEmiko lives with her Ojiichan in a small town on BC's West Coast surrounded by friends and neighbors, including her childhood friend Kenzo Sanada, who wishes she'd spend less time playing matchmaker. But Emiko can so clearly see who belongs together, even when her targets don't know it themselves. She simply has to meddle - for the sake of true love!\n\nAs for her own romantic life though . . . who has time for that? Emiko is far too busy with her matchmaking schemes, her brunch recipes, volunteering, her bustling social life, keeping up her grades, eating said brunch recipes and making plans for after graduation. Plans she will absolutely decide on soon. Definitely. Maybe? But when Emiko ends up falling for the last person she expects, she finds herself caught in the tangled web of her own love matches. For the first time, instead of arranging from afar, Emiko has to figure out what it means to be in love herself, and that friendship and romance are more complicated than she ever imagined . . .\nAbout the Author:\nChieri Uegaki is a second generation Japanese-Canadian and award-winning children\u2019s author living and writing on Vancouver Island, in the traditional and unceded territory of the l\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n speaking peoples, today known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations.\nShe graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia\u2019s Creative Writing Department and has written a number of stories for children, including the picture books Suki\u2019s Kimono and Rosie and Buttercup (both illustrated by St\u00e9phane Jorisch); Hana Hashimoto, Sixth Violin (illustrated by Qin Leng); and Ojiichan\u2019s Gift (illustrated by Genevieve Simms).\nWhen not reading or writing, Chieri consumes rom-coms and mysteries in any form, chooses appetizers over dessert most of the time, and tries to stay on top of her collecting problem. She is currently working on a number of projects.\nRachel Pilois (Book Buyer) on this selection:\nThere have been many retellings of Austen\u2019s novels in the last 200 years. Pride and Prejudice easily wins the prize of Austen\u2019s most adapted novel in both film and literature. In the last 20 years there\u2019s been a noticeable growth in culturally (and gender) diverse takes on Austen\u2019s work, with the most popular retellings being of Indian (i.e Bride and Prejudice) or African-American (i.e. Ibi Zoboi\u2019s Pride) heritage. Sadly, some of her less popular novels (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey) have few adaptations in both film and literature, faithful or modern retelling.\nWith the 2026 theme of the JASNZ being diversity it made sense to choose a slightly less popular novel (only in terms of how many adaptations) and a slightly less common culture used in Austen retellings. Thus I settled on the upcoming YA novel Emiko by Chieri Uegaki, a Japanese-Canadian retelling of Emma.\nEmma is a much beloved story and a much beloved character, who\u2019s thoughts, actions and motivations are very recognisable in a modern teenager. Adding in the deep cultural etiquette of Japan as a likeness to the rules of regency society, makes Uegaki\u2019s Emiko a brilliant and well thought out modern retelling of the Emma.\nAs it publishes on 9 September 2025, we can discover and discuss this new and exciting adaptation for the first time together! \nNB: Ticket numbers are limited to ensure ease of discussion. Afternoon tea is provided\nFRIEND: bring a friend, get 10% off! Discount automatically applied",

    "description": "Contemporary Realism, Whether you work from objects, the figure, or secondary sources, this is an opportunity to explore working more loosely, using oils or acrylics.\n\nJustine will guide you through drawing and painting exercises to help loosen you up, and will discuss art historical techniques that may be relevant to your individual artistic style and context.\n\nThis course will increase your ability to represent perceived objects in a dynamic, painterly way. You will be guided through drawing and painting exercises to help you achieve accuracy of form, working loosely with oils and acrylics to create fresh contemporary paintings. The emphasis is on working with your chosen source material to create a `next level\u2019 painting. This course is for those who have explored some of the basics of painting such as mixing colours, blending etc, but want to find a process that best expresses your unique approach and ideas. Skills learnt in class can be applied across all genres.\n\nMaterials are not included in this course. Please bring your preferred range of oils, brushes and supports (paper, canvas, or board). A good basic set of oil paints would include cad and lemon yellow, ultramarine and cerulean blue, and cad red and alizarin crimson. Also, black and white. Inverlochy will supply Liquin and odourless turps. Please also bring a photocopied reference image in both black and white and\ncolour.\n\nLunch break - 30 minutes.

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\n$7.50 each or multiples of 3 $20\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

We were also making experimental attempts into the world of radio, with the birth of Mouthfull\u2019s first international streaming server, playing music 24/7 (also live events a few times a week).\nIf we travel even further back in time, 2017 was the debut of the \u201cMouthfull Radio\u201d episodic series (~20eps) - but we consider the ongoingness the real thing to celebrate.\nMoving towards present day ~ through a vast richness of hosts, events, music, shows, zines, selectors, connections, pop ups, and story-times. It is a real joy to help community contemporary radio ripple out from this Pacific Island nation to the world wide web.\n\n5 Years goes so fast, and so we shall honour this time with a great celebration in the capital city of Aotearoa! We will bring together all of the elements of Mouthfull you have known to love; make some books, make up some new dance moves with friends, and make our ears glisten in the sounds of live and selected music.\nWhiro // New Moon. The last dark night of winter. A time for reflection; an invitation to come together as friends and wh\u0101nau and plant intentional seeds for future flowers to bloom, as well as rest in deep listening and shared beingness.\n\nLineup:\n*\u00baJuniper May\n*\u00baStar Time\n*\u00baajhoneysuckle (t\u0101maki)\n*\u00baMystery Waitress (duo)\n*\u00baDJ B.Lo (wh\u0101katu)\n*\u00b0Benny Salvador\n\n\nWe are also releasing our first ever compilation. This special event will be opened with a premiere listening session of the full CD, playing the album all the way through. You can purchase a physical copy at the show, or on bandcamp (preorders open September 1st).\n5PM sharp CD push play. Some divine collaborators with unique new releases on offer.\n\nThis is a fundraiser to support the sustainability of Mouthfull. We are only able to pay the bills due to events like this, and are fundraising to support a long awaited update of our digital infrastructure to enable future support. THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT - you can support us by purchasing a ticket (extra donation if you are balling), a tshirt, a raffle ticket, or a zine - it all goes to the same goal of enabling & uplifting one another.\n",

This series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\nEach of the evenings will bring a different electronic vibe, conjured by some of Wellington\u2019s most innovative artists. The series lineup includes:\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\nTickets are available from Wednesday 18 June, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\nAbout the Artists\nLudus\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\nStephen Gallagher\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\nDavid Long\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\nJules Desmond\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\nOghum\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\nJess Chambers\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration.

They are songs of farewell and of gentle heartbreak. The words of the final song, 'Im Abendrot', speak of an elderly couple walking hand in hand, at rest from their wanderings, away from life. The final verse:\n\nO weiter, stiller Friede! O vast and silent peace!\nSo tief im Abendrot So deep in sunset glow,\nWie sind wir wanderm\u00fcde- How weary we are with wandering-\nIst dies etwa der Tod? Could this perhaps be death?\n\nFor this special premiere performance, Salina Fisher has arranged the 'Four Last Songs' for NZTrio and celebrated Australian soprano Emma Pearson.",

With a powerful, honey soaked voice that has won praise and support slots from legendary American country rock pioneers like The Jayhawks and original cosmic cowboy Steve Young, Phil has 20 years worth of road worn original songs to pull on, including tracks from the critically acclaimed CANYON RYDE album 'Free To Be' and some choice country rock covers to weave a spell on any listener.\nSaali Marks\nA singer, songwriter, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, Saali Marks hails originally from the\nSouth Island, but has made Wairarapa his home for the last 20 years, where he lives on a farm\nwith his family and teaches music at Kuranui College.\nSaali has played in numerous bands over the years, in a wide range of styles from proto-punk\nto psychedelic dub, covers, originals and fully improvised music with no discernible genre, on\nstages throughout Aotearoa since 1991. Currently he fronts the Wellington ska band Battleska\nGalactica.\nThroughout and alongside it all Saali has indulged his love for songwriting and solo\nperforming, developing a unique style, rooted in folk and blues, and inspired by greats from\nacross the decades. A skilled guitarist, Saali rarely plays straight ahead chords, and an\neducation in jazz has informed his ear for harmony, the beauty of dissonance, tension and\nresolution, with unconventional song structures, alternate tunings and intriguing melodies.\nAlthough not adverse to penning the odd love song, most of Saali\u2019s lyrics tend to focus on\nother aspects of the human condition, from religion and politics to our relationships with the\nenvironment and our own minds.

You can expect to laugh at their humorous take on some songs, cry at the beautiful ballads they partner on and be toe tapping to their groove. Davey\u2019s acute ear and sound experience allow him to distil the very essence of a song and craft arrangements showcasing the underlying groove inherent in his playing. His voice, reserved, yet soulful and resonant along with his sympathetic guitar chops, elevate Celine\u2019s and other songs to new and sometimes surprising places. Celine provides rhythm guitar and a powerhouse vocal performance, she can own the biggest banger, feel the suffering of a blues standard or dial it right back to expose all the sentiment in a ballad.",

Blending noise and melody, Dropper is dynamic, song-centred, high-energy indie rock. Often compared to Bob Mould\u2019s work with H\u00fcsker D\u00fc or Lou Barlow's early Sebadoh, they\u2019ve been described by one review as having a \"high energy stage performance punctuated by flawless musicianship and songwriting skills that seems beyond the years...Honestly, it\u2019s hard to overstate how impressed I was with Dropper and am eagerly awaiting my next chance to see them live.\u201d\n\nElly Mae's music encapsulates the bittersweet complexities of growth, relationships, time escaping, and the nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, shoegaze and whatnot.\n\nGrab your general release tickets online for just $15! Or, even better, grab an early bird ticket for only $10 and secure your spot for a night of unforgettable live music. Doors at 8pm, first act on at 8:30pm. ",

    "description": "Jazz Orchestra Composer Series Presents Louisa Williamson, The ninth concert in this series of Aotearoa composers features the multi-talented saxophonist/composer Louisa Williamson. Since completing a Masters of Music in Composition in 2020, she has released two albums of original music (What Dreams May Come and Groundwork). In 2023 Louisa won the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award for her piece Dream Within A Dream, and in 2024 Louisa received a composition commission from the Wellington Jazz Festival and headlined the festival with the new work, The Chasm Where We Fall Into Each Other.  Louisa has worked with L.A.B, Bret McKenzie, AJA, The Rodger Fox Big Band, Royal NZ Air Force Band, Trinity Roots and Lord Echo.\n\"This commission opportunity has come at a perfect time for me to process some recent grief and pain that\u2019s inhabited my circles. Whilst composing this music, I\u2019ve thought about ideas around mental health, specifically with youth in Aotearoa, and also honouring some friends who have passed.

Finally, Franck's youthful Piano Trio No. 1 in F sharp minor is as charming and intimate as it is powerful and explosive. ",

This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\n",

With its apocalyptic opening, O Fortuna, this masterpiece explores the capricious nature of fate, the joys and sorrows of life, and the boundless energy of human passion.

Both works will feature acclaimed pianists Jian Liu and Diedre Irons in little known arrangements\n\nThis performance will be mighty in sheer scale, with nearly 300 performers on stage, including a children\u2019s chorus, the combined power of two elite choirs, and the dynamic sound of the Wellington Brass Band.

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nMercy Lie:\n\nDriving all night under the stars, along the highways of human experience, the original songs of Mercy Lie will haunt, surprise, remind and affirm.\n\nMercy Lie is the musical guise of Laura Chester-Murphy. An instinctive sound maker from an early age, Laura just wants to keep the music rolling. There\u2019s a lot of sound from that little acoustic guitar and a voice to match. In the songs, you will find fierce independence, crushing vulnerability and a reflective wit that speaks to a life of figuring stuff out along the way.\n\nWith influences ranging across and not limited to folk, funk, country, goth, indie and 90\u2019s rave, Laura puts the focus on crafting percussive earworms that won\u2019t leave your head easily. The music of Mercy Lie is a unique soundscape, sculpted with ambience and depth, the silence unforgettably painted by explorations into the motivations of both the self and fellow travellers.\n\nMercy Lie is about connecting over the foibles of polite society and the ways we are wired to weave around each other.\n\nHometowns, journeys, mysteries, ghosts, growing up, messing up, speaking out, moving on. If you like getting nostalgic over something and nothing all at once, buckle up.\n\n\u201cMercy Lie\u2019s novel approach to the guitar and talent for songwriting make for the perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that voice to come from that mouth.\u201d\n\u201cAn acoustic delight!\u201d\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness.

Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna.

The story involves a 'child' (L'enfant) whose awful behaviour brings an unexpected response: first the furniture rebels, the grandfather clock, the broken china cup, then the mathematics tutor and the Princess in the fairy tale book come to life, and eventually all the animals in the garden - squirrels, dragonfly, birds rise up - all of whom have good reason to 'teach the child a lesson'. It's a fabulous journey that we go on with the child who is confronted by all of these and indeed learns...\n\nThis is a project involving the whole of the Classical Performance programme: the voice students sing all the roles, each performing several roles, the NZSM orchestra will play for the performances, and the piano students are taking part as rehearsal pianists (r\u00e9p\u00e9titeurs) and playing in the orchestra.\n\nLighting design by Alex Fisher, set and costumes by Grace O\u2019Brien, assistant director Theresa Hanaray, chorus master Kathryn Mosley, the show has been coordinated by NZSM Head of Classical Voice Jenny Wollerman in collaboration with the Toi Whakaari technical programme staff, graduates, and students",

    "description": "Raven Mavens Quartette in concert, Raven Mavens Quartette\nSuppose you can imagine the sound of the blues, spiced by flavours of the American songbook, folk, country, and even the rock and roll of Jerry Lee Lewis, driven by the unmistakable sound of boogie woogie piano. In that case, you have the Raven Mavens Quartette.  \n\nIt is both an accident and it isn\u2019t that this is an all-female group. The group had its genesis a decade ago when piano player and singer-songwriter Cindy Muggeridge encountered the singing and clarinet skills of Marian Carter. They formed the Raven Mavens as a duo that included a core of folk and blues, and exploited the singing talents of the pair through finely crafted harmonies.  \n\nThe success of their combination in playing local gigs and folk festivals opened up opportunities with other musicians, and the next step was the inclusion of drummer Anje Glindemann, who has played in a list of local bands, including Tin Pan Alley, Hen Picked and more recently the Salty Hearts. Anje can also be seen performing with Kapiti Coast singer-songwriter icon Andrew London.  And finally, the addition of multi-instrumentalist Kate Marshall. \u201cKate is an amazing player\u201d, Cindy says. \u201cShe can move as easily from piano accordion, to fiddle or flute, depending on what the song calls for - or she feels like playing!\u201d And of course, like the other members of the group, she sings.  \n\nThe instrumental diversity of the line-up was now established, but what also distinguishes this group is the addition of Cindy Muggeridge\u2019s original songs to the set. \u201cWriting my own songs has been part of the musical journey for me\u201d, says Cindy, \u201cand it just led naturally to offering some of them to the other singers in the group\u201d. The \u201cfun\u201d of their music and the unmistakable presence of four female musical masters is what they will be sharing when they play at The Offering as part of Greytown ArtTown.\n\nBuy tickets in advance here or txt bookings to 02102361951.\n\nPlease note The Offering is fully licensed and will be serving snacks and drinks. Please note this concert replaces Bob McNeill and Emily Roughton due to illness.",

With a deep adoration for Pacific musical reference points and a desire to explore new sonic ground, LEAO synthesises non-traditional tonalities with a fa\u2018asamoa spirit, creating what some have called \u201cniu wave\u201d and \u201cPacific neo-psychedelia.\u201d A creative enigma and phenomenal live act since the release of their critically acclaimed debut GHOST ROADS in 2019, LEAO has continued to expand its vision with the 2024 single TAEAO / MEA UMA - a sparkling glimpse into a significant body of alternative Pacific music currently in development. The group is now actively working towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\n\n\nRomi Wrights\n\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring stories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke festival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release mid to late 2025.",

It draws inspiration from urban isolation and the weight of expectations. Tracks from the EP have landed on major Spotify and Apple playlists. Reflecting the office environment, familiar to many, this performance will bring to life the themes from the EP in a host of ways.\nWith over 2.2 million streams across platforms and 1.8 million on Spotify alone, his impact is growing. Releases have landed on global and regional editorial playlists. His EPs\u2014Fantasy, Monarch, SugarCoated and now F.O.M.O \u2014have consistently showcased his range and evolution as an artist.\nSig Wilder & Friends blend kiwi authenticity with American grit, bringing you a well-worn handwritten journal of lived experiences rendered through metaphor, poetic prose, and the stylistic conventions of folk, alt-country and late-night heartbreak radio.\nJosh Glennie is a soulful singer/songwriter based in Wellington, New Zealand. He's made a name for himself playing in bands around Wellington and is now striking out with his own solo material. Together with Tarn, they have produced a new EP of songs that cut to the bone, focused around acoustic guitar and Josh's striking vocals. His New EP is expected late 2025/early 2026. ",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.

With a string of releases on Berlin-based PHTM, T\u0101maki Makaurau-based Gypnotica, and an impressive catalog of self-releases, he consistently showcases his singular and original interpretation of dance music.\nInstagram.com/e.li\nelihoff.bandcamp.com\nabyssalsoundworks.bandcamp.com\n\nHUNTER \u2014 Hang the Saints / Haven\nRaised in Kaik\u014dura, Aotearoa, Hunter's dark and atmospheric sound often contrasts the beautiful environment she grew up in. Her direct approach to techno draws influence from heavy percussion, bold rhythm and industrial soundscapes. After spending two years finding inspiration in clubs overseas, she has returned to \u014ctautahi with a refined style that\u2019s ready to make people dance. As the co-founder of \u201cHang The Saints\u201d and resident of \u201cHaven\u201d, Hunter is all about creating safe, inclusive spaces for people to connect through the music she loves.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sspoonsnake/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hunter-mccrory-334790608\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/bC3qeA6pUxBoMo7P9\n\nLUDUS & RIZZO \u2014 Tonic Collective\nTonic Collective is the recent endeavour of Ludus and Rizzo, inspired by the people, places and spaces of their experience touring China with BIRDPARTY and Vera Ellen. Both acts are individually known for their versatile and innovative sound, bringing a wide range of influences and inspirations to the dancefloor. In the short time since establishing the collective, they\u2019ve already hosted Kaishandao and Bone Chapel, established a space, and debuted a monthly radio show on Mouthfull that explores sound from across the genre spectrum, both in the club and out.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ludus.etc/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alicerizzoofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tonic.collective/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/l-s.../416life-support-cl1n1c-chengdu\nhttps://soundcloud.com/racquetclub-info/mix-series-016-ludus\n\nSHLI \u2014 Echo Train Records / Warehouse Rave / Holding Hands\nShli is the alias of \u014ctautahi-via-P\u014dneke DJ and Producer Tim Ward.

His productions are jagged and abstract, built from negative space, ambient haze and rhythms that never quite resolve. There\u2019s hip hop in the DNA, but it never plays by the rules, always veering towards something stranger, softer, rawer.\n\nThrough his label PLZ Make It Ruins, Vegyn has built an entire world. His 2019 debut Only Diamonds Cut Diamonds felt like a manifesto; the 71-track Text While Driving If You Want To Meet God! followed as a chaotic, genre-agnostic statement of intent. Since then, he\u2019s ventured further leftfield, releasing The Head Hurts but the Heart Knows the Truth under the alias Headache, followed by the 2024 masterpiece The Road to Hell Is Paved with Good Intention, and the unexpected arrival of Blue Moon Safari - an output that feels made more for himself than for any audience. Dreamlike, disjointed and deeply personal.\n\nAs a DJ, Vegyn shifts between industrial breaks, ambient drift and warped club memories. This October, he returns to Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Wellington and Auckland - a rare chance to slip through the cracks and step inside his world.\n\n",

These works reflect a compositional approach shaped by both the harmonic and improvisational sensibilities of contemporary jazz pianists such as Brad Mehldau, Robert Glasper, and Aaron Parks, and the rhythmic, melodic, and resonant qualities of indigenous Samoan music, drawn from my own cultural heritage.

Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995. Wendyhouse output has been somewhat sporadic ever since, but with EE monk\u2019s recent return, the pair have returned to performing live.\nWendyhouse music was initially played on toy musical instruments, the kind that fit inside a Wendy house. Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo. Guitar, toy keyboard and vocals are the Wendyhouse instruments of choice.\n---\n\nDSLB\nDSLB is the solo project of Chrissie Butler (the shouty bass playing half of the now sleeping duo, mr sterile Assembly). An offshoot from Chrissie's other band Ditzy Squall, DSLB (Ditzy Squall's Lunch Box) is a showcase for a love of long endings and the hum things make when you hold them close to your ear. Performed live, DSLB is an improvised mash-up of ancient record players, purring keyboards, kitchen utensils and found objects. Soundtracks for short films and hand drawn comics are also residents in the lunch box. Recordings are released by skirted Records.\nhttps://skirtedrecords.com/dslb/\n---\nvegetable.machine.animal\nNew solo project courtesy of Mr Sterile, in which living fungal and plantlife inform a modular synthesiser with biofeedback. This signal acts upon the synth changing the pitch, tone, rate and more in the delivery of sound. These \u2018curated\u2019 sounds are then responded to with percussion.

From a young age she was drawn to music as a means for reflection and self-expression. During her music studies at university, she was introduced to taonga p\u016boro, and this sparked a personal journey of reconnection to te ao M\u0101ori and her own whakapapa. Following university, she lived in an ashram for several years where she was introduced to the wonderful practice of bhakti yoga. She now lives with her husband in the Wellington region, where they regularly participate in kirtan (mantra music meditation) at Bhakti Lounge.\n\n\nPeter is P\u0101keh\u0101, with grandparents from England and Ireland, and has been on a four-year journey learning the art of taonga p\u016boro \u2014 the traditional M\u0101ori musical instruments of Aotearoa. Guided by the wisdom and generosity of expert makers and players, he has learned both to craft and to play these unique instruments. For Peter, taonga p\u016boro offer a way to connect deeply with sound, story, and the natural world, and he is excited to share their voices as part of this sound bath experience.\nWhat\u2019s on the menu?\nJackfruit Rendang\nSatay Seitan Skewer\nGado Gado salad with peanut sauce\nRice\nBanana cake with caramel suace\nHot \"chocolate\"\n................................................................................................\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

He spent his high school years in Northern Ontario and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and three children.\nWesley is currently the Central Canada Director for Apologetics Canada and has been a guest on a variety of public platforms, from The Joe Rogan Experience and Piers Morgan Uncensored, to Apologia Radio and Daily Dose of Wisdom. He has participated in numerous public dialogues, debates, and interfaith events on issues of belief and religion globally.\nHe holds a BA in sociology from York University, a Masters of Theological Studies from Tyndale University, and is currently doing a PhD in New Testament at the University of Toronto\u2019s Wycliffe College.
