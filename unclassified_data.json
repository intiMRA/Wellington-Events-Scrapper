Superior Donuts by Tracy Letts, Stagecraft presents: \u201cSuperior Donuts\u201d\nBy Tracy Letts\nDirected by James Kiesel\n26 November \u2013 6 December 2025\n\u201cWhat could be more human, than to be scared, and keep it a secret.\u201d\nArthur Przybyszewski (that's (p)Shub-er-shef-ski), is the proprietor of a modest, behind-the-times donut shop in uptown Chicago. He can't seem to find joy in anything these days, not even the donuts he used to take such pride in making by hand. Vandals armed with spray paint, predatory landlords, and that nefarious Starbucks down the road all threaten to unceremoniously snuff out the only thing he's got left.\nThat is, until an upstart, ambitious young man shoulders his way into becoming a Superior Donuts employee, and an unlikely friendship (or is it a rivalry?) develops, inspiring both to face the demons they've been hiding from all this time.\nThis is a sharp-witted, heartfelt comedy by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts (\u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d) offering a warm and wry take on depression, diversity, and bravery that will leave you feeling all fluffy and sugary on the inside. Plus, who knows, you might get a donut!\nGo to the Stagecraft website to book your spot!\nhttps://www.stagecraft.co.nz/auditions\nAUDITIONS:\nAuditions will be on Saturday 13th & Sunday 14th September, with callbacks the evening of Monday 15th September.\nTo book an audition, please fill out the form by 10th September - we'll be in touch to confirm your audition date, time and location. If you have any questions please get in touch at auditions@stagecraft.co.nz.\nRoles (just try your best with accents, coaching available once casting is complete)\nArthur Przybyszewski [Male, Polish, 50s - 60s]\nThe owner and operator of Superior Donuts. Old, grumpy, and more than a little depressed. Secretly an artisan and a scholar, he\u2019s spent his whole life running from conflict. Until now? [Has a scene involving some violence]\nFranco Wicks [Male, African-American, 20s]\nYoung, idealistic, a little pushy, and full of attitude and energy. Franco believes that good things will happen to him despite all odds, and evidence, to the contrary. A former employee of Luther.\nMax [Male, Russian, 40s - 60s]\nOwner of the DVD shop next door, Max is interested in buying Superior Donuts to expand his (tiny) capitalist empire. Fancies himself a self-made man. [Speaks in a Russian accent, along with some dialogue in Russian]\nRandy [Female, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nRaised in the middle of 7 brothers and working as a cop in the Chicago Police Department, Randy\u2019s always been \u2018one of the boys\u2019. Big hockey fan. Has a soft spot for Arthur.\nJames [Male, African-American, 30s - 40s]\nAnother cop with the Chicago Police Department and Randy\u2019s beat partner. Well-respected in the community and [not so] secretly a giant Star Trek nerd. [Will consider any and all BIPOC actors for this role]\nLady [Female, Irish-American, 60s - 70s]\nLikely homeless and definitely a little hard-of-hearing, Lady is a well-known as a confusing-but-likeable, perhaps even mascot-like figure in the Uptown community. Well past the point of giving a crap about what other people think.\nLuther [Male, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nLocal bookie and crime-syndicate everyman, Luther has scratched out his living taking money from gambling addicts, which he finds troubling because he\u2019d like to consider himself a good, fair man. Has a stomach ulcer which is probably somehow representative of this inner conflict. [Has a scene involving some violence]\nKevin [Male, Irish, 20s]\nAnother of Luther\u2019s employees, Kevin\u2019s probably fallen into the wrong crowd as a young man, but it doesn\u2019t seem to trouble him that much. Seems to care mostly about getting paid and drinking Coca-Cola.\nKiril [Male, Russian, 20s - 30s]\nA shy man of few words (mostly \u2018hello\u2019), Kiril is an intimidating figure with a big soft heart beating beneath his tall muscular frame. Brought into the fold to be a construction worker and bodyguard, he\u2019s mostly interested in falling in love with the local bartender. [Most dialogue is in Russian] ",

A lot has happened to Wayne over the last 10 years. He has retired, his son has moved to London with his grandchildren and Maggie, his wife of 49 years, passed away suddenly a year ago. For Wayne, his family and his work were his life. They were the source of his life's pleasure and purpose and now he is having to cope with the loss of both.\n\nThe only thing left to take his mind off the pain is cycling with his MAMIL friends, especially Bryan, the central character of MAMIL. But a panic attack mid-ride and a crash with catastrophic consequences leads to a crisis of cycling confidence and the inability to do the thing he loves the most.\n\nLike MAMIL, it takes an array of characters to help the central character rediscover what is truly important when their life seems adrift and meaningless. A relentlessly positive Scottish counsellor, a philosophical Romanian personal trainer, Wayne\u2019s new arch-enemy in the form of an ocker Ozzie retirement village owner who grinds his gears and yes, even Pinarello -- the Italian bike of Bryan\u2019s and Wayne\u2019s nightmares -- all wittingly and unwittingly help Wayne get back on the bike and realise he still has something to offer, he still has a purpose and most importantly a reason to get out of bed every morning aside from going for a piss.\n\n\u201cAn engaging and earnest work of art, packed with",

Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it's going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa. Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you're a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show digs deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, family, and the undeniable need to keep moving\u2014no matter how creaky your knees may be.\n\nGet ready to laugh, reflect, and maybe even wince in recognition as GOMIL pedals its way across the country this spring. It\u2019s more than a show\u2014it\u2019s a celebration of growing older (and slightly wider) with humour, heart, and a healthy dose of spandex.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next chapter in this iconic Kiwi comedy saga. GOMIL is coming to a theatre near you - lycra, laughter and all.\n\n--\nFor accessibility seating information and wheelchair space bookings please email kiaora@teraukura.nz or call 04)9740535 during office hours.",

The story involves a 'child' (L'enfant) whose awful behaviour brings an unexpected response: first the furniture rebels, the grandfather clock, the broken china cup, then the mathematics tutor and the Princess in the fairy tale book come to life, and eventually all the animals in the garden - squirrels, dragonfly, birds rise up - all of whom have good reason to 'teach the child a lesson'. It's a fabulous journey that we go on with the child who is confronted by all of these and indeed learns...\nThis is a project involving the whole of the Classical Performance programme: the voice students sing all the roles, each performing several roles, the NZSM orchestra will play for the performances, and the piano students are taking part as rehearsal pianists (r\u00e9p\u00e9titeurs) and playing in the orchestra.",

He is a creature of curiosity and crepes, having spent the last 14 years skulking around the capital publishing \u201cwoke leftist paper\u201d as a founder of 5ever books. He has conquered our hearts, minds, and the specialty cheese departments of the local supermarkets. Achille is a master of chain maille, now offering to teach his craft to those willing to take up the challenge.\nSome materials and tools are supplied. Depending on the project you choose to create there may be extra material costs, as well as the option to purchase tools for personal use. You are welcome to bring your own bent nose pliers and wire cutters if you have them.\nThere are variable pricing options, unwaged/student, waged, and generous. Please choose whichever option feels right for you and your circumstances! Note that this ticket is a commitment to the entire seven week course. No chain maille experience is required, just a will to delve into the depths of metal weaves. If you're unsure about committing to this craft, perhaps keep an eye out for a one off 101 chain maille class that may come in the future.\nCourse Outline:\nWeek 01 - 18th September\n101: Basic Skills and Discovery\nAt this class we'll explore the basics of good chain maille practice.\nOpening & closing rings properly\nTrying out some simple structures\nBegin exploring material options and how to make your own rings\nHomework: keep an eye out for recycled or foraged materials that could be utilised in chain maille\nWeek 02 - 25th September\nPlay and Exploration\nGathering inspiration and looking into methods for individual projects\nPlaying with recycled & foraged materials\nHomework: Choose a weave from the library to try out at home or explore during the next class\nWeek 03 - 2nd October\nMathematics of chain maille design, theory, and history.\nMath of designing chain maille\nTheory & pre-planning\nDiscussion about ideas for individual projects\nIdentify materials needed to execute individual designs\nHomework: Choose your individual project, identify what materials you will need, and how we will source/make them.\nWeek 04 - 16th October\nBy this class you will have you project plan down. We'll be collecting/ making our materials or beginning the execution of our projects with the guidance of Achille.\nWeek 05 & 06 - 23rd & 30th October\nThese classes will be open working times to make use of tools in class, ask Achille questions or help with troubleshooting, and to share our progress, challenges, and solutions with each other.\nWeek 07 - 6th November\nAt this final class we will make finishing touches to our projects and celebrate our creations together! Perhaps including a catwalk of our chain maille wares, and sharing kai.",

This advanced class is ideal for those who are already competent at soldering simple joins, annealing, and basic tool use on their own. Students must have completed a minimum of two 4-week blocks or one 6-week block. If you are unsure of your level, please contact us for advice.\n\nAn advanced set of students means that your tutor can support you to take on more exciting and complex challenges. They will work with the group to find appropriate projects. Each 4-week block may focus on a particular skill topic, rather than covering many different topics for each student.\n\nLevel 2 students will learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project to hone their skills. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet, or a more complex bezel setting.\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple, self-directed projects to work on in class.\n\nPlease note that this class fee does not include materials. All metals and stones, as well as quality findings and chains, are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it in future projects. If you need to arrange an alternative payment plan, please contact us.",

We invite you to THEA 303\u2019s \u2018Carnival of Chaos\u2019 in Studio 77, premiering hybrid works from the House of Echoes (1 & 3 October): The Odyssey, Medea\u202fand\u202fThe Devil is a Lover, and the House of Secrets (2 & 4 October): Rope, The Taming of the Shrew\u202f and\u202f God\u2019s Gift.\n\nEach adaptation has been directed, designed, produced, choreographed and managed by the students.\n\nHouse of Echoes (Season A): Performs on the 1st and the 3rd of October\n\nThe Odyssey \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Homer\u2019s The Odyssey\nOdysseus just wants to get home to his true love, but the journey isn\u2019t exactly smooth. The streets after 2 a.m. and too many beers are alive with obstacles; cops are grumpy, goth girls are tempting, and the help of the Gods is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, back home, a dangerous polycule is getting cozy with his Penelope\u2026\n\nMedea \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Euripides\u2019 Medea\nMedea lives her perfect 1950s white picket fence dream! When her husband starts taking new pills \u201cConservatol, the wonder drug for traditional love\u201d she learns that traditional love means different to what she thought. Betrayal, hurt, and anger push her to the edge making her act in ways she never thought she would. \u201cHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned.\u201d\n\nThe Devil is a Lover \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Love Labours Lost\u202fand Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Devil is an Ass\nSatan and two devils, Beelzebub and Pug, make a pact to travel to a 1920s speakeasy on Earth and abstain from corruption for 3 years.

Marion and Melanie are sure they\u2019ve committed the perfect murder by killing their friend Norman and hiding his body in a chest, a chest their select group of friends have been invited over to have a murder mystery games night around. It\u2019s foolproof, until the over analytical Constance comes to play\u2026\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew\nIn 1970's Aotearoa, sisters Katherina and Bianca find their love lives complicated by their father's order that one may not pursue romance unless the other follows suit. The sudden appearance of a charming factory owner and friend of Bianca's beau could mark a new hope for the two, but will this lead to an ocean of love or does something far more sinister lurk beneath the surface?\n\nGod\u2019s Gift \u2013\u202fAn adaptation of Ben Johnson\u2019s\u202fThe Alchemist\nThe Carnival has come to town in 1615 London. Lovewit has gone to see the show, leaving her manor in the hands of Jeremy the Butler, the \u201cAlchemist,\u201d and Dol, a hardworking prostitute. Lovewit\u2019s house becomes a place for schemes, with ample opportunities to take money from foolish men. Will Dol be happy with her split of the money? Or will a surprise visitor shake things up?\n\nContent Forecast: mentions of and implied sexual violence and domestic abuse, mentions of drug use, strobe lighting, violence, coarse language, loud noises, haze, and smoke.",

We want to emphasise our values regarding generous giving and mindful taking.\n\u2022 We are an inclusive group and all members and sectors of our community are welcome.\n\n2.00-2.30pm\n\u2022 Close out, put away tables and clear the hall.\n\nThe meetings will be held regularly on the 2nd Saturday of every month.\n\nFurther information:\n1. There will be a koha food box for anyone who wants to donate food or seedlings in addition to their swaps. The Crop Swap team will distribute any koha crop and left over crops to local food pantries.\n\n2. If you do not have any crops to swap but need fresh fruit or veges for the next week, you can bring plants, flowers, seedlings, herbs, eggs, preserves, jams, baking, liquid manure, gardening books, magazines, planting containers, sometimes even chooks who need a new home! We want this to be accessible to everyone, especially those who are struggling to put fresh fruit and veges on the table!\n\nAlso check out other Meetups in Paraparaumu, Nonprofit events in Paraparaumu.",

Peter is reluctant to stay with nanna in the school holidays because she lives in the country and doesn't have a TV but Nanna finds ways to engage Peter in her love of the forest, especially the precious manu, when they build a nesting box for Ruru together. Peter is excited to see if Ruru will make her home in the box, waiting patiently while many other birds arrive to check out the box first! And after all that waiting, Nanna takes Peter on an exciting night time forest walk to find Ruru - in the dark! The bird characters are all familiar New Zealand locals, such as piwakawaka, kereru, tui and ruru, and the story highlights the importance of supporting them and the different needs they may have. Teachers and Parents have been ecstatic about this show and hundreds of New Zealand children have been transfixed by it.\nAs quoted by Theatreview: \u201cThis is truly a New Zealand show for New Zealand children and all those young-at-heart\u201d.",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.",

We have had some exciting news that we cannot share for now but as a result we must move our beautiful 35mm from its usual location into storage for a bit. We are not sure when it will be set back up so to celebrate we are running a marathon of six 35mm features across one Saturday!\nWe will kick off the first film at 1:30pm sharp on Saturday and will have a short dinner break after the third film. All going to plan we should be done by around 12:30am.\nIn terms of the features, we have films from the 1960s through to the early 2000s with a mix of comedies, sci-fi, horror and cult classics! Granted not all of these films would be considered masterpieces but there is nothing more fun than sitting in a crowd not knowing what could be coming next!\nWe will have a snack menu you can pre-order before the first film so aim to arrive around 1:00pm to order. The breaks between films will be very short (probably just enough time for the projectionist to thread up the next film) so make sure you come prepared for back-to-back screenings.\nThis event has strictly no digital projection, it\u2019s all film all the time. Now in theory it should all playback without a hitch as we are bringing in some of the best projectionist\u2019s Wellington has. But 35mm is a strange beast that can sometimes throw up the odd issue.\nAll tickets are $50\nSeating is general admission and cinema entrance will be determined by earliest ticket purchase times. ",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, 2025 Taiwan Update Lectures\nJoin us for three talks by experts on different aspects of Taiwan\n\nAbout this Event\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\n\n\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\n\n\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 01:00 PM - 02:00 PM\nTaiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nInfo: In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:00 PM - 02:15 PM\nCoffee Break\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:15 PM - 03:15 PM\nWhat does Taiwan's two-level politics tell us?\nInfo: This presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:15 PM - 03:45 PM\nAfternoon Tea\nInfo: Please join us outside AM103 for some light refreshments\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:45 PM - 04:45 PM\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nInfo: This talk explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games.

    "description": "Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal International Order, Abstract\nOver the last decade, China has punished countries that undermine its territorial claims and foreign policy goals with measures such as restricting trade, encouraging popular boycotts, and cutting off tourism. These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods.

This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives.

It\u2019s also just a different & cool way of meeting new people by getting a bit out of your comfort zone and skipping the small talk!\nJoin us for games, talks, and connections with friends you haven\u2019t met yet. Join if you get annoyed after being asked what you do, where you are from, and how long you have been in Wellington every single time you meet someone. If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation.

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\n$7.50 each or multiples of 3 $20\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

We were also making experimental attempts into the world of radio, with the birth of Mouthfull\u2019s first international streaming server, playing music 24/7 (also live events a few times a week).\nIf we travel even further back in time, 2017 was the debut of the \u201cMouthfull Radio\u201d episodic series (~20eps) - but we consider the ongoingness the real thing to celebrate.\nMoving towards present day ~ through a vast richness of hosts, events, music, shows, zines, selectors, connections, pop ups, and story-times. It is a real joy to help community contemporary radio ripple out from this Pacific Island nation to the world wide web.\n\n5 Years goes so fast, and so we shall honour this time with a great celebration in the capital city of Aotearoa! We will bring together all of the elements of Mouthfull you have known to love; make some books, make up some new dance moves with friends, and make our ears glisten in the sounds of live and selected music.\nWhiro // New Moon. The last dark night of winter. A time for reflection; an invitation to come together as friends and wh\u0101nau and plant intentional seeds for future flowers to bloom, as well as rest in deep listening and shared beingness.\n\nLineup:\n*\u00baJuniper May\n*\u00baStar Time\n*\u00baajhoneysuckle (t\u0101maki)\n*\u00baMystery Waitress (duo)\n*\u00baDJ B.Lo (wh\u0101katu)\n*\u00b0Benny Salvador\n\n\nWe are also releasing our first ever compilation. This special event will be opened with a premiere listening session of the full CD, playing the album all the way through. You can purchase a physical copy at the show, or on bandcamp (preorders open September 1st).\n5PM sharp CD push play. Some divine collaborators with unique new releases on offer.\n\nThis is a fundraiser to support the sustainability of Mouthfull. We are only able to pay the bills due to events like this, and are fundraising to support a long awaited update of our digital infrastructure to enable future support. THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT - you can support us by purchasing a ticket (extra donation if you are balling), a tshirt, a raffle ticket, or a zine - it all goes to the same goal of enabling & uplifting one another.\n",

This series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\nEach of the evenings will bring a different electronic vibe, conjured by some of Wellington\u2019s most innovative artists. The series lineup includes:\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\nTickets are available from Wednesday 18 June, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\nAbout the Artists\nLudus\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\nStephen Gallagher\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\nDavid Long\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\nJules Desmond\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\nOghum\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\nJess Chambers\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration.

BUT WHO ARE THE DECEMBERISTS?\nHailing from Portland Oregon, The Decemberists is an indie-alt folk rock band that write epic songs and have 9 studio albums to their credit. They are renowned for their musical style and unique storytelling with many song lyrics based on historical incidents and folklore. Perhaps drawing musical influence from the likes of The Beatles, Tom Waits, REM, Morrisey, their songs are exquisitely constructed and effortlessly combine folk-rock with elements of pop creating the infectious sound that is The Decemberists.\nAnd who is BANDIT QUEEN? Experienced Christchurch based musos - Tim Kent (vocals, acoustic guitar); Justin 'Rusty' White (lead guitar); Jo-Anne Davern Fuller (vocals, keyboard); Chiara Lowe (violin, vocals); Adam Lowe (bass); Mark Newburn (drums, percussion).\nThe members of BANDIT QUEEN are passionate about this project and invite you to come experience and enjoy the eclectic music of USA indie-rock band THE DECEMBERISTS.",

    "description": "Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour, Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour\nIndie-Folk Artist Colette Rivers and her band will be performing her intimate new album, The Backyard Wonder.\n\nIndependent artist Colette Rivers is releasing her second full-length album, The Backyard Wonder, an intimate exploration of healing, change, and the quiet beauty of ordinary moments.\n\nThis album holds special meaning for Rivers: after being diagnosed with cancer in July 2023, her planned sophomore release had to take a back seat to recovery. But when the cancer returned in early 2025, she felt compelled to finish and release the album, not just as a legacy project, also as a celebration after hard times, with a focus on how \u201cyou can find the wonder in life, even in your backyard.\u201d\n\nA lifelong creative, Rivers records, mixes, and produces in her home studio in Masterton, and plays every instrument heard on The Backyard Wonder. Her debut album, Memory Lake (2020), was shaped by early years spent in the US, and her move to Taup\u014d at age 11; this was followed by a nationwide tour. Now based in the Wairarapa and working as a secondary school drama teacher, Rivers continues to move between solo performance and full band sets, while staying rooted in the acoustic traditions that define her sound.\n\nWith her right arm partially paralysed following recent treatment, Rivers has gathered a group of close friends to help bring the songs of The Backyard Wonder to life (especially its intricate fingerpicking parts) for a run of live shows. She\u2019ll be touring the Wellington and Wairarapa regions from August through October, finishing with a set at the Wellington Folk Festival.\n\nOpening for Rivers is Beans:\n\nBeans is a recent fixture in the P\u014dneke folk scene, importing a wild array of original songs and generally embodying the classic singer songwriter formula \u2013 introvert plus guitar. They are one third of folk trio 'Don & the Divorcees', but are known for solo shows which are rich with humour, honesty and interesting word choices. Expect to feel things.\n\n\nYou may also like the following events from Colette Rivers:\nThis October, 4th October, 08:00 am, Colette Rivers - The Backyard Wonder tour in Clareville\nAlso check out other Music events in Wellington, Entertainment events in Wellington, Arts events in Wellington.",

This will be an evening to feast your ears on a diverse soundscape of angular guitars, melodic goodness, and glorious noise.\n\nHere\u2019s the lo-down:\n\nFirst Reserve is inevitable. Before adopting the moniker in 2023, Ryan Connaghan had been prolifically writing music that communicated their experiences in life, love, and loneliness. These themes are all approached on songs like \u201cLast One\u201d and \u201cMe & My Friends\u201d \u2013 the first offerings from First Reserve\u2019s debut EP set for release in late 2025. On stage, their sound is both intimate and larger-than-life, combining influences from alt-rock, indie-folk, and pop.\n\nDropper combines intuitive songwriting sensibilities with wall-of-sound, guitar.  Blending noise and melody, Dropper is dynamic, song-centred, high-energy indie rock. Often compared to Bob Mould\u2019s work with H\u00fcsker D\u00fc or Lou Barlow's early Sebadoh, they\u2019ve been described by one review as having a \"high energy stage performance punctuated by flawless musicianship and songwriting skills that seems beyond the years...Honestly, it\u2019s hard to overstate how impressed I was with Dropper and am eagerly awaiting my next chance to see them live.\u201d\n\nElly Mae's music encapsulates the bittersweet complexities of growth, relationships, time escaping, and the nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, shoegaze and whatnot.\n\nGrab your general release tickets online for just $15! Or, even better, grab an early bird ticket for only $10 and secure your spot for a night of unforgettable live music. Doors at 8pm, first act on at 8:30pm. ",

    "description": "Folk B*tch Trio - Wellington, Folk Bitch Trio - 'Now Would Be A Good Time' Album Tour with special guest Georgia Knight\n\nNow Would Be A Good Time, the debut album by Folk Bitch Trio, tells vivid, visceral stories. Their music sounds familiar, and it\u2019s built on a foundation of the music they\u2019ve loved throughout their lives\u2013gnarled Americana, classic rock, piquant, clear-eyed balladry. But the songs are modern, youthful, singing acutely through dissociative daydreams and galling breakups, sexual fantasies and media overload, all the petty resentments and minor humiliations of being in your early twenties in the 2020s.\n\nHeide Peverelle (they/them), Jeanie Pilkington (she/her) and Gracie Sinclair (she/her) have known each other since high school, and first started singing together five years ago. Peverelle recalls sending Pilkington a heartbroken\u2014in their words \u201cbad\u201d\u2014song they had written called \u201cEdie\u201d; Pilkington remembers the song differently. \u201cI felt so inspired that my teenage peer had written something so honest and original,\u201d she recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before she messaged Peverelle and Sinclair, asking if they\u2019d be interested in starting a \u201cfolk bitch trio.\u201d As soon as they started singing together, their connection deepened, and \u201cthe chemistry of being inspired by each other was evident from the get-go,\u201d says Sinclair.\n\nListening to Folk Bitch Trio, it\u2019s clear that this is a band of three distinct points of view, with contrasting and complementary backgrounds and visions. Pilkington grew up with two musician parents and brings formative memories of watching them perform, of listening to Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams, and of her own imagined path as a career musician. Peverelle spends their spare time making art and furniture; those hobbies, as well as their love of pop music old and new, articulate a love for the tactile, the home-grown and the hand-made. Sinclair is the self-proclaimed jester of the group, but her taste skews dark, gothic, baroque and dramatic, expressed as a love of opera and ballet as well as musicians as wide-ranging as Patti Smith, Nirvana and Tchaikovsky.\n\nFolk music has a bad habit of being presented as a deathly serious concern. It\u2019s the music you cry to, it\u2019s overly sacred, it\u2019s solemnly considered by critic-historians. But Folk Bitch Trio have a shared sense of humour that is embedded deep in their music and that sets it alight, safe from the self-serious traps of the genre. Now Would Be A Good Time is funny and darkly ironic in the manner of writers like Mary Gaitskill or Otessa Moshfegh. On \u201cGods A Different Sword\u201d they crack that \u201cMy body keeps the score/But if you tell me that you need it/I can get up off my floor,\u201d a nod to the clich\u00e9d, over-referenced millennial self-help book, as they wryly sing about sex within earshot of housemates, and wring sexual innuendo from physics terminology",

Longer residencies have occurred in our town but nothing currently running holds a candle to that sort of effort by a single artist, at a single venue, in this town (and possibly beyond).\nWe boast quite the legacy: two Tui-nominated live albums, several bar owners, many managers and staff, hundreds of featured professional musicians and young artists, 500-odd gigs, uncountable numbers of pizzas, beer, whisky, and much laughter and joy. From local music students to top-notch international artists we\u2019ve seen it all.\nIt\u2019s a huge milestone - 20 years of high quality music played by a massive variety of talented people.\nThe exciting programme is largely finalised and is pasted below.\nMark the date!\nTable bookings 04 974 2207 or info.therealm@nzvenueco.nz or therealm.co.nz and click on \u2018book a table\u2019\nGreat ambience, good company, superb kai and stellar music. What more could a jazz fan want?

She has since expanded her sound and it\u2019s safe to say each set will keep you guessing what will come next as she effortlessly merges genres such as Baile Funk, Ghetto Tech, Jersey Club, Juke, Afro beat inspired drums, Techno and many more global club soundscapes that encompass her high energy DJ sets. MESSIE\u2019s sets are guaranteed to be bootleg heavy with something for everyone as she draws from her own music taste of rap and grime, to early 2000\u2019s singalongs, girl-boss anthems and queer music culture in the form of edits you\u2019d never expect.\n\nAlongside her headline tour around Aotearoa in mid 2024, MESSIE has now brought her fresh, high-energy club music to Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, R&V, Beyond The Valley, Wildlands, Love Saves The Day, Gemfest & Outro Festival. With slots at Pohoda Festival, Hidden Festival, Motion, Truck Festival, AIASOUND and All Points East locked in for the second half of 2025, there is no slowing her down.",

Turina's Circulo depicts a single day through dawn, midday and dusk, while brooding disquiet meets stark intensity in Shostakovich's Piano Trio No.1 in C minor. Chen Yi's Tibetan Tunes creates a fusion of traditional Tibetan melodies referencing Buddhist god Du Mu, before the premiere of Angelus, a new commission by one of Aotearoa\u2019s most acclaimed composers, John Psathas. Finally, Franck's youthful Piano Trio No. 1 in F sharp minor is as charming and intimate as it is powerful and explosive. ",

Both works will feature acclaimed pianists Jian Liu and Diedre Irons in little known arrangements\n\nThis performance will be mighty in sheer scale, with nearly 300 performers on stage, including a children\u2019s chorus, the combined power of two elite choirs, and the dynamic sound of the Wellington Brass Band. Add to this the extraordinary talents of soloists Emma Pearson (soprano), Stephen (\"Coco\") Diaz (tenor), and James Harrison (baritone), and you have a musical event of epic proportions.",

To unnerve the unprepared with a deranged, grisly intensity which very few, if any, can match.\nRecently reforming to the original line-up, Singapore\u2019s WORMROT resume their genius in unleashing exquisite noise together, with the announcement of a new album 'TNT'.

We warmly invite you to join us and become a part of this collaboration of creativity and connection; spanning triumph and heartbreak, and everything in between, celebrating all it means to be human.\n\nOur wonderful hosts at Firebird Caf\u00e9 will be serving their delicious food and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nTickets are $15 online or $20 on the door.\n\nMercy Lie:\n\nDriving all night under the stars, along the highways of human experience, the original songs of Mercy Lie will haunt, surprise, remind and affirm.\n\nMercy Lie is the musical guise of Laura Chester-Murphy. An instinctive sound maker from an early age, Laura just wants to keep the music rolling. There\u2019s a lot of sound from that little acoustic guitar and a voice to match. In the songs, you will find fierce independence, crushing vulnerability and a reflective wit that speaks to a life of figuring stuff out along the way.\n\nWith influences ranging across and not limited to folk, funk, country, goth, indie and 90\u2019s rave, Laura puts the focus on crafting percussive earworms that won\u2019t leave your head easily. The music of Mercy Lie is a unique soundscape, sculpted with ambience and depth, the silence unforgettably painted by explorations into the motivations of both the self and fellow travellers.\n\nMercy Lie is about connecting over the foibles of polite society and the ways we are wired to weave around each other.\n\nHometowns, journeys, mysteries, ghosts, growing up, messing up, speaking out, moving on. If you like getting nostalgic over something and nothing all at once, buckle up.\n\n\u201cMercy Lie\u2019s novel approach to the guitar and talent for songwriting make for the perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that voice to come from that mouth.\u201d\n\u201cAn acoustic delight!\u201d\n\nAraiyah & Izzy:\n\nBorn in the coastal town of Patea and raised in the vibrant community of Gisborne, Araiyah\u2019s musical journey is as rich and diverse as her heritage. Now based in Wellington, she is not just a musician but a devoted mother of four tamariki and a proud grandmother to one mokopuna. For the past decade, Araiyah has poured her heart into writing, recording, and performing her original compositions, each note resonating with the depth of her experiences.\n\nAraiyah\u2019s music is a poignant reflection of her life\u2019s journey, weaving together themes of love, loss, and resilience. Her deeply moving compositions are rooted in the lessons learned through relationships and the pain that often accompanies them. Through her art, she shares a narrative of healing, transformation, and the strength that comes from embracing vulnerability.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse array of artists such as Bic Runga, Tracy Chapman, and The Eagles, Araiyah\u2019s sound is a fusion of heartfelt storytelling and melodic richness. However, it is her whanau and friends who serve as her greatest inspiration, fuelling her passion and creativity. Their support and love provide the foundation upon which her music thrives, making each performance an authentic expression of her gratitude and connection to those who matter most.\n\nWith a voice that captivates and lyrics that resonate, Araiyah invites listeners into her world\u2014a place where pain transforms into beauty, and healing becomes a shared experience. As she continues to evolve as an artist, Araiyah\u2019s music promises to touch the hearts of many, leaving a lasting impact on all who have the privilege of listening.\n\nAraiyah will be accompanied by guitarist Izzy and Laura Chester-Murphy on percussion.\n\nRain and the Urban Bohemians:\n\nFormed around the music of singer-songwriter Cathy Elizabeth aka Rain, supported by her band of Urban Bohemians, this group has been able to weave together many different influences and styles to create something quite unique and beautiful.\n\nPeppered with contemplations of our existence and the fleetingness of time, Rain & the UBs bring the magic with a folk-rock edge and an alluring authenticity at its centre. Spiritual undertones and overtones give way to an uplifting joyfulness, of triumph over difficulties and life lessons learned and expressed through music.\n\nWith Cathy Elizabeth on vocals & acoustic guitar, Chris Ewers on bass, Murray James on drums and Izzy and Dion on guitars, these guys have got the goods and are ready to deliver!\n\nSo come along and allow yourself to be immersed and transported, moved and entertained. It\u2019s going to be a very special night all round!\n\nAlso check out other Music events in Otaki, Entertainment events in Otaki, Arts events in Otaki.",

    "description": "Sirens: LadyReign, Edera, Cryfor, LadyReign presents SIRENS on the 17th Sept 2025 at Valhalla Tavern, featuring three of Wellington's most eclectic female fronted artists: LadyReign, Cryfor & Edera.\nWith a lineup designed to increase in intensity, the tunes of these baddies will make you cry, headbang and two-step. At the same time you ask? Come find out.\nEdera is an alt-rock\u2013indie\u2013sad girl artist from Te Whanganui-a-Tara, delivering romantic yet callous songwriting that makes you want to dance, cry, and maybe do both at once. Ederacore blends lush indie textures with gritty rock energy, brought to life by melancholy rock legends Aidan Thomas-Inwood (guitar), Lily Hodgson-Bell (bass), and Taiki Yoshino (drums) - Together, they create an immersive live experience\u2014intimate, cathartic, and impossible to forget.\nLadyReign is a six-piece alternative-metal band blending soul-stirring harmonies with the raw\nintensity of heavy metal breakdowns. Fronted by two powerful female vocalists, the band\ncreates a captivating contrast that draws inspiration from both soulful icons like Lianne La\nHavas and the crushing heaviness of bands like Spiritbox. LadyReign fuses vulnerability with\naggression in a sound that is both haunting and refreshing.\nWith their fearless blend of metal and soul, LadyReign is a band that leaves an unforgettable\nmark on the Wellington and wider Aotearoa music scene.\nIn faith to the literal etymology of the term 'metalcore', Cryfor combines Bridge 9, Deathwish era hardcore with golden era melodic death metal. As hard as they are brutal, Cryfor aims to bring real deal spin kickers and battle jacket bros together in the same pit.\nOriginally starting as the bedroom recording project of vocalist and lyricist Ella O'Neill, Cryfor is a band dedicated to reviving and breathing new life into 2000s style metalcore.\nAfter recruiting drummer Fionn Lawley, and guitarist/backing vocalist Daniel Jenner (ex King Hit HC & Temperatures Rising) in late 2024 and bassist Daniel Walters in early 2025, Cryfor has been a rolling tank of non-stop hatemosh force.",

It draws inspiration from urban isolation and the weight of expectations. Tracks from the EP have landed on major Spotify and Apple playlists. Reflecting the office environment, familiar to many, this performance will bring to life the themes from the EP in a host of ways.\nWith over 2.2 million streams across platforms and 1.8 million on Spotify alone, his impact is growing. Releases have landed on global and regional editorial playlists. His EPs\u2014Fantasy, Monarch, SugarCoated and now F.O.M.O \u2014have consistently showcased his range and evolution as an artist.\nSig Wilder & Friends blend kiwi authenticity with American grit, bringing you a well-worn handwritten journal of lived experiences rendered through metaphor, poetic prose, and the stylistic conventions of folk, alt-country and late-night heartbreak radio.\nJosh Glennie is a soulful singer/songwriter based in Wellington, New Zealand. He's made a name for himself playing in bands around Wellington and is now striking out with his own solo material. Together with Tarn, they have produced a new EP of songs that cut to the bone, focused around acoustic guitar and Josh's striking vocals. His New EP is expected late 2025/early 2026. ",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019.

The Aeronaut is currently still a work in progress; this evening offers keen punters a chance to watch Vorn and his frighteningly good band (Nick Brown - Drums; Charley Davenport - Bass, Thomas Liggett - Violin) iron out the final kinks on a future Kiwi classic. Be there so you can say you were!\nhttps://vornpowertool.bandcamp.com/\nThagomizer is the dino synth project (dinosaur themed dungeon synth) of Caspar Kneale (yes, he is related, in fact mr Birchville Cat Motel is Caspar's Dad). Inspired by the vibe of retro dinosaur media, Thagomizer aims to summon a Mesozoic mood to transport you back in time. As far as we know, Thagomizer is the only dino synth project in the country.\n\n$17.50 presales available via UTR\nSpecial thanks to CNZ for supporting Pyramid Club's programme ",

After being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition at the age of eleven that left him paralyzed from the waist down, Wes experienced a miraculous recovery for which the doctors themselves had no medical explanation.

He spent his high school years in Northern Ontario and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and three children.\nWesley is currently the Central Canada Director for Apologetics Canada and has been a guest on a variety of public platforms, from The Joe Rogan Experience and Piers Morgan Uncensored, to Apologia Radio and Daily Dose of Wisdom. He has participated in numerous public dialogues, debates, and interfaith events on issues of belief and religion globally.\nHe holds a BA in sociology from York University, a Masters of Theological Studies from Tyndale University, and is currently doing a PhD in New Testament at the University of Toronto\u2019s Wycliffe College.
