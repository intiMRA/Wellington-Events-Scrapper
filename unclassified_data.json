The National War Memorial and FPC Martin Square are both undergoing major refurbishment - join us for a look behind the scenes!\nNational War Memorial: Refurbishing a Wellington Icon\nStep behind the scaffolding and witness the National War Memorial Project \u2013 a complex seismic strengthening project where heritage sensitivity is of utmost importance. With construction works being carried out by Maycroft Construction, join us for the rare opportunity to explore a significant piece of the capital\u2019s cultural fabric.\nKnown to many as the backdrop of ANZAC Day commemorations, this national memorial is undergoing a meticulous refurbishment to ensure its legacy endures for generations to come.\n What\u2019s Happening On Site:\nSeismic strengthening of the tower and bell frame \nStone remediation to preserve its historic fa\u00e7ade\nAsphalt roofing works\nThe real challenge? Balancing modern engineering with heritage preservation. Every upgrade is being carried out with deep respect for the building\u2019s historical significance.\n\nThen, just around the corner, we will move on to another refurbishment project \u2013 at a much different scale and for a very different purpose!\n FPC Martin Square: from Workshop to Office Space\nLeading industrial design-and-build specialists First Principles Constructors are celebrating seven years of innovation with a bold move - into a brand-new headquarters in central Wellington. Take a look inside the transformation of a former engineering workshop into the new HQ for FPC. With exposed services, raw materials, and an industrial aesthetic, this compact yet clever refurbishment shows how much can be achieved in a small urban footprint. Construction is well underway by Aoraki Construction, with completion coming up in September.\nWhat\u2019s Happening On Site:\n\u2022 \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002Structural steel installation, new roofing, cladding, a new concrete mezzanine slab\n\u2022 \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002Interior fit-out works\n\u2022 \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002Full building services upgrades\n The Details:\n\ud83d\udd52 DATE and TIME: Wednesday, 20th August, meet at 2.45pm for a 3.00pm start at the National War Memorial\n\ud83d\udccd LOCATION: Meet at the National War Memorial (19 Buckle Street) to explore this site first.

    "description": "Box of Birds, Hailed as \"the cutest little show in Aotearoa\" (Hamilton Arts Festival 2024), award-winning theatre company Birdlife Productions have created this gorgeous theatre show designed especially for ages 4 to 9 years, Including exquisite puppetry, live interactive songs, projection and the teaching of a waiata, this work reflects our transformative connection to nature. Peter is reluctant to stay with nanna in the school holidays because she lives in the country and doesn't have a TV but Nanna finds ways to engage Peter in her love of the forest, especially the precious manu, when they build a nesting box for Ruru together. Peter is excited to see if Ruru will make her home in the box, waiting patiently while many other birds arrive to check out the box first! And after all that waiting, Nanna takes Peter on an exciting night time forest walk to find Ruru - in the dark! The bird characters are all familiar New Zealand locals, such as piwakawaka, kereru, tui and ruru, and the story highlights the importance of supporting them and the different needs they may have. Teachers and Parents have been ecstatic about this show and hundreds of New Zealand children have been transfixed by it.\nAs quoted by Theatreview: \u201cThis is truly a New Zealand show for New Zealand children and all those young-at-heart\u201d.",

As a former drummer, her passion for drumming was the pipeline for her falling in love with genres like Garage, Breakbeat, and Jungle. She has since expanded her sound and it\u2019s safe to say each set will keep you guessing what will come next as she effortlessly merges genres such as Baile Funk, Ghetto Tech, Jersey Club, Juke, Afro beat inspired drums, Techno and many more global club soundscapes that encompass her high energy DJ sets. MESSIE\u2019s sets are guaranteed to be bootleg heavy with something for everyone as she draws from her own music taste of rap and grime, to early 2000\u2019s singalongs, girl-boss anthems and queer music culture in the form of edits you\u2019d never expect.\n\nAlongside her headline tour around Aotearoa in mid 2024, MESSIE has now brought her fresh, high-energy club music to Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, R&V, Beyond The Valley, Wildlands, Love Saves The Day, Gemfest & Outro Festival. With slots at Pohoda Festival, Hidden Festival, Motion, Truck Festival, AIASOUND and All Points East locked in for the second half of 2025, there is no slowing her down.",

We\u2019ll break down movements, go over cues and choreography, and look at how to increase or decrease intensity (or manage any injuries we might be carrying). We\u2019ll take a break together and some healthy snacks will be provided along with hot drinks. We\u2019ll then head into another Dance Fitness session where you can put your newfound knowledge to use (or just have some fun and party like it\u2019s Friday night)! After a stretch and cooldown, we\u2019ll do a bit of a wrap up over lunch (bring your own) and spend some time relaxing and chatting. Hot drinks will be available, or you can pop out if you need a barista made flat white!\nIf you\u2019re not staying for the full day, we\u2019ll say farewell after lunch and the rest of us will prepare to greet those coming in for the afternoon session.\nThe afternoon will start with a Strong Fit session which will contain elements of our Thursday night class. We\u2019ll then move straight into a Tips and Tuition session which will look at all elements of our Strength Based Combo class. This will include form, technique, options, and how to maximise your weekly workouts. We\u2019ll then take a break with some healthy (and easily digested) snacks before we power into a final Strong Fit session. Following the session, we\u2019ll have a decent stretch and take the time to review what we\u2019ve learned, chat amongst ourselves, and say farewell before our day concludes at 4pm. ",
