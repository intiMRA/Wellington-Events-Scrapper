"description": "Site Visit - Studio of Pacific Architecture - Te Aro Double-Header!, Join us on Wednesday 20 August, for an exclusive NAWIC members-only site tour of two very different but geographically close projects in Te Aro. The National War Memorial and FPC Martin Square are both undergoing major refurbishment - join us for a look behind the scenes!\nNational War Memorial: Refurbishing a Wellington Icon\nStep behind the scaffolding and witness the National War Memorial Project \u2013 a complex seismic strengthening project where heritage sensitivity is of utmost importance. With construction works being carried out by Maycroft Construction, join us for the rare opportunity to explore a significant piece of the capital\u2019s cultural fabric.\nKnown to many as the backdrop of ANZAC Day commemorations, this national memorial is undergoing a meticulous refurbishment to ensure its legacy endures for generations to come.\n What\u2019s Happening On Site:\nSeismic strengthening of the tower and bell frame \nStone remediation to preserve its historic fa\u00e7ade\nAsphalt roofing works\nThe real challenge? Balancing modern engineering with heritage preservation. Every upgrade is being carried out with deep respect for the building\u2019s historical significance.\n\nThen, just around the corner, we will move on to another refurbishment project \u2013 at a much different scale and for a very different purpose!\n FPC Martin Square: from Workshop to Office Space\nLeading industrial design-and-build specialists First Principles Constructors are celebrating seven years of innovation with a bold move - into a brand-new headquarters in central Wellington. Take a look inside the transformation of a former engineering workshop into the new HQ for FPC. With exposed services, raw materials, and an industrial aesthetic, this compact yet clever refurbishment shows how much can be achieved in a small urban footprint. Construction is well underway by Aoraki Construction, with completion coming up in September.\nWhat\u2019s Happening On Site:\n\u2022 \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002Structural steel installation, new roofing, cladding, a new concrete mezzanine slab\n\u2022 \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002Interior fit-out works\n\u2022 \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002Full building services upgrades\n The Details:\n\ud83d\udd52 DATE and TIME: Wednesday, 20th August, meet at 2.45pm for a 3.00pm start at the National War Memorial\n\ud83d\udccd LOCATION: Meet at the National War Memorial (19 Buckle Street) to explore this site first. We will then walk over to 21 Martin Square as a group, for the next site visit.\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f COST: Free to NAWIC members, with a maximum of 18 people on the tour, so please book your space consciously. Get in quick! You can join NAWIC here.\n\ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2640\ufe0fPPE: Hard hat, hi-vis, steel-capped boots. (Spare hard-hats/hi-vis are available if required, please make sure you advise us of what you need on your RSVP.)\n \ud83c\udf89 After the site visits, unwind with drinks and nibbles sponsored by First Principles Constructors at a nearby venue (TBC) \u2013 a chance to connect, reflect, and chat all things design and construction.\n\ud83e\udde1 Huge thanks to Studio of Pacific Architecture, Aoraki Construction, Maycroft Construction, and First Principles Constructors for teaming up to make this event possible.\nPlease note: NAWIC is a voluntary organisation, committed to its obligations as a PCBU under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.

Peter is reluctant to stay with nanna in the school holidays because she lives in the country and doesn't have a TV but Nanna finds ways to engage Peter in her love of the forest, especially the precious manu, when they build a nesting box for Ruru together. Peter is excited to see if Ruru will make her home in the box, waiting patiently while many other birds arrive to check out the box first! And after all that waiting, Nanna takes Peter on an exciting night time forest walk to find Ruru - in the dark! The bird characters are all familiar New Zealand locals, such as piwakawaka, kereru, tui and ruru, and the story highlights the importance of supporting them and the different needs they may have. Teachers and Parents have been ecstatic about this show and hundreds of New Zealand children have been transfixed by it.\nAs quoted by Theatreview: \u201cThis is truly a New Zealand show for New Zealand children and all those young-at-heart\u201d.",

"description": "MESSIE - Wellington, MESSIE is taking Aotearoa\u2019s electronic dance music scene to filthy new levels. As a former drummer, her passion for drumming was the pipeline for her falling in love with genres like Garage, Breakbeat, and Jungle. She has since expanded her sound and it\u2019s safe to say each set will keep you guessing what will come next as she effortlessly merges genres such as Baile Funk, Ghetto Tech, Jersey Club, Juke, Afro beat inspired drums, Techno and many more global club soundscapes that encompass her high energy DJ sets. MESSIE\u2019s sets are guaranteed to be bootleg heavy with something for everyone as she draws from her own music taste of rap and grime, to early 2000\u2019s singalongs, girl-boss anthems and queer music culture in the form of edits you\u2019d never expect.\n\nAlongside her headline tour around Aotearoa in mid 2024, MESSIE has now brought her fresh, high-energy club music to Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, R&V, Beyond The Valley, Wildlands, Love Saves The Day, Gemfest & Outro Festival. With slots at Pohoda Festival, Hidden Festival, Motion, Truck Festival, AIASOUND and All Points East locked in for the second half of 2025, there is no slowing her down.",
