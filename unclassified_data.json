Last month was intense, and we love intensity, but felt the need to bring it down. The focus for this month is calm. Chill. Relaxation. This is truly going to be the most gentle Airhorn you have seen.\nThere will be no flashing lights or threat of epilepsy. There will not be loud noises or gross out humour. There will not be airhorns! This is not a bit. We are sincerely concerned that folks are going to come to think this is a goof and expect the usual madcap, abrasive chaos of our comedy show.\nThere will be no abrasion. There will be no chaos. We are wanting to do the most experimental show we can do, which in our case is a low-key, cozy, warm-hearted hour of quiet reflection and gentle comedy.This is going to be a soft show for everyone who needs a minute to just breathe. You will laugh, but not enough to hurt your side or upset your neighbor. It will be a laugh held in the liminal space between a deep breath and a long sigh.\nFor folks in which this amount of calm is too stressful, we will also have a Stimulation Booth (provided by Wattie's) available at any time to provide the classic Airhorn jolt they need.

Superior Donuts by Tracy Letts, Stagecraft presents: \u201cSuperior Donuts\u201d\nBy Tracy Letts\nDirected by James Kiesel\n26 November \u2013 6 December 2025\n\u201cWhat could be more human, than to be scared, and keep it a secret.\u201d\nArthur Przybyszewski (that's (p)Shub-er-shef-ski), is the proprietor of a modest, behind-the-times donut shop in uptown Chicago. He can't seem to find joy in anything these days, not even the donuts he used to take such pride in making by hand. Vandals armed with spray paint, predatory landlords, and that nefarious Starbucks down the road all threaten to unceremoniously snuff out the only thing he's got left.\nThat is, until an upstart, ambitious young man shoulders his way into becoming a Superior Donuts employee, and an unlikely friendship (or is it a rivalry?) develops, inspiring both to face the demons they've been hiding from all this time.\nThis is a sharp-witted, heartfelt comedy by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts (\u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d) offering a warm and wry take on depression, diversity, and bravery that will leave you feeling all fluffy and sugary on the inside. Plus, who knows, you might get a donut!\nGo to the Stagecraft website to book your spot!\nhttps://www.stagecraft.co.nz/auditions\nAUDITIONS:\nAuditions will be on Saturday 13th & Sunday 14th September, with callbacks the evening of Monday 15th September.\nTo book an audition, please fill out the form by 10th September - we'll be in touch to confirm your audition date, time and location. If you have any questions please get in touch at auditions@stagecraft.co.nz.\nRoles (just try your best with accents, coaching available once casting is complete)\nArthur Przybyszewski [Male, Polish, 50s - 60s]\nThe owner and operator of Superior Donuts. Old, grumpy, and more than a little depressed. Secretly an artisan and a scholar, he\u2019s spent his whole life running from conflict. Until now? [Has a scene involving some violence]\nFranco Wicks [Male, African-American, 20s]\nYoung, idealistic, a little pushy, and full of attitude and energy. Franco believes that good things will happen to him despite all odds, and evidence, to the contrary. A former employee of Luther.\nMax [Male, Russian, 40s - 60s]\nOwner of the DVD shop next door, Max is interested in buying Superior Donuts to expand his (tiny) capitalist empire. Fancies himself a self-made man. [Speaks in a Russian accent, along with some dialogue in Russian]\nRandy [Female, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nRaised in the middle of 7 brothers and working as a cop in the Chicago Police Department, Randy\u2019s always been \u2018one of the boys\u2019. Big hockey fan. Has a soft spot for Arthur.\nJames [Male, African-American, 30s - 40s]\nAnother cop with the Chicago Police Department and Randy\u2019s beat partner. Well-respected in the community and [not so] secretly a giant Star Trek nerd. [Will consider any and all BIPOC actors for this role]\nLady [Female, Irish-American, 60s - 70s]\nLikely homeless and definitely a little hard-of-hearing, Lady is a well-known as a confusing-but-likeable, perhaps even mascot-like figure in the Uptown community. Well past the point of giving a crap about what other people think.\nLuther [Male, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nLocal bookie and crime-syndicate everyman, Luther has scratched out his living taking money from gambling addicts, which he finds troubling because he\u2019d like to consider himself a good, fair man. Has a stomach ulcer which is probably somehow representative of this inner conflict. [Has a scene involving some violence]\nKevin [Male, Irish, 20s]\nAnother of Luther\u2019s employees, Kevin\u2019s probably fallen into the wrong crowd as a young man, but it doesn\u2019t seem to trouble him that much. Seems to care mostly about getting paid and drinking Coca-Cola.\nKiril [Male, Russian, 20s - 30s]\nA shy man of few words (mostly \u2018hello\u2019), Kiril is an intimidating figure with a big soft heart beating beneath his tall muscular frame. Brought into the fold to be a construction worker and bodyguard, he\u2019s mostly interested in falling in love with the local bartender. [Most dialogue is in Russian] ",

The book will be launched by Emily Perkins.\nThursday 9 October, 6pm\nUnity Books Wellington\nFree event \u2013 all welcome!\nAll Her Lives follows women across generations as they resist, nurture and transform. These are lives shaped by love and politics, motherhood and memory, constraint and defiance.\nFrom girls raised in the garden of Plunket founder Truby King, to a queer university student at a mid-2000s Berlin rave, to a mother facing the cost of her son\u2019s climate rebellion, the women of All Her Lives are complex, resilient and deeply human. Shadowing their stories is the early feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, whose journey of grief and revolution will become a vessel for what endures \u2013 and for finding hope.\nVast and intimate, All Her Lives explores the layered selfhood of women \u2013 all that they inherit, sacrifice, imagine and carry forward \u2013 and the power found in unravelling and reweaving those selves on their own terms.\n'A wonderful collection that swims in and out of women's lives across time, exploring the struggle for freedom and love. I'll be thinking about it for a long time - a book of quiet force.' \u2014Emily Perkins, author of Lioness\n'All Her Lives is a reckoning. A stunning tour de force of women\u2019s lives across centuries, continents and political movements. The collection reads as a protest song book, calling through the ages for change, revolution and peace. Horrocks is one of the most powerful storytellers of our time and All Her Lives is the author's most triumphant work.\u2019 \u2014Laura Jean McKay\nIngrid Horrocks\u2019s books include the memoir Where We Swim (2021), a literary history, Women Wanderers and the Writing of Mobility (2017), and two collections of poetry.

In 2024 she was the Kaituhi Tar\u0101whare CNZ Writer in Residence at the International Institute of Modern Letters, and in 2025 she was awarded the Michael King Writers Centre Australian Residency at Varuna.

Peter is reluctant to stay with nanna in the school holidays because she lives in the country and doesn't have a TV but Nanna finds ways to engage Peter in her love of the forest, especially the precious manu, when they build a nesting box for Ruru together. Peter is excited to see if Ruru will make her home in the box, waiting patiently while many other birds arrive to check out the box first! And after all that waiting, Nanna takes Peter on an exciting night time forest walk to find Ruru - in the dark! The bird characters are all familiar New Zealand locals, such as piwakawaka, kereru, tui and ruru, and the story highlights the importance of supporting them and the different needs they may have. Teachers and Parents have been ecstatic about this show and hundreds of New Zealand children have been transfixed by it.\nAs quoted by Theatreview: \u201cThis is truly a New Zealand show for New Zealand children and all those young-at-heart\u201d.",

A lot has happened to Wayne over the last 10 years. He has retired, his son has moved to London with his grandchildren and Maggie, his wife of 49 years, passed away suddenly a year ago. For Wayne, his family and his work were his life. They were the source of his life's pleasure and purpose and now he is having to cope with the loss of both.\n\nThe only thing left to take his mind off the pain is cycling with his MAMIL friends, especially Bryan, the central character of MAMIL. But a panic attack mid-ride and a crash with catastrophic consequences leads to a crisis of cycling confidence and the inability to do the thing he loves the most.\n\nLike MAMIL, it takes an array of characters to help the central character rediscover what is truly important when their life seems adrift and meaningless. A relentlessly positive Scottish counsellor, a philosophical Romanian personal trainer, Wayne\u2019s new arch-enemy in the form of an ocker Ozzie retirement village owner who grinds his gears and yes, even Pinarello -- the Italian bike of Bryan\u2019s and Wayne\u2019s nightmares -- all wittingly and unwittingly help Wayne get back on the bike and realise he still has something to offer, he still has a purpose and most importantly a reason to get out of bed every morning aside from going for a piss.\n\n\u201cAn engaging and earnest work of art, packed with",

Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it's going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa. Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you're a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show digs deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, family, and the undeniable need to keep moving\u2014no matter how creaky your knees may be.\n\nGet ready to laugh, reflect, and maybe even wince in recognition as GOMIL pedals its way across the country this spring. It\u2019s more than a show\u2014it\u2019s a celebration of growing older (and slightly wider) with humour, heart, and a healthy dose of spandex.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next chapter in this iconic Kiwi comedy saga.

Bear witness the cruelty of Emperor Nero and his crimes driven by an unbridled and unabated passion.

    "description": "Opening - Slipping through your fingers, grasping, Meanwhile invites you to the opening of \u2018Slipping through your fingers, grasping\u2019 by Justine Fletcher, Christine Brimer andRita Takeuchi\n_____\nThe text Sounding the Event, by artist and writer Yve Lomax, raises the question \u201cWhat does it mean to grasp something by letting it slip through your fingers?\u201d\nSlipping Through Your Fingers, Grasping explores the paradoxical ways in which everyday experiences can be apprehended\u2014through their fluid, malleable qualities rather than rigid, unyielding structures. The installation brings together the practices of Justine Fletcher, Christine Brimer, and Rita Takeuchi to draw attention to the fleeting essence of daily life, the interplay of absence and presence, and the ever-changing nature of time and memory.\nExperience is always slipping away; time, memory, or an event can only be grasped in their passing, in their trace, or in their absence. Short, intermittent chimes highlight this ephemerality, making duration palpable through moments of presence and absence. Paintings emerge from an attunement to everyday encounters and their emotional resonance, while sculptural and woven forms unravel and shift, emphasising process not as a means to an end, but as a state of becoming. Together, the works suggest that sometimes the only way to \u201chold\u201d something, whether a moment, time, or an atmosphere, is by revealing its impermanence.\n",

They trust each other, the audience, improv, and the moment to find their form. Nothing is decided beforehand.\nRich and Rebecca Sohn met as improvisers in Chicago over 30 years ago. As long-time teachers, this duo show began when former students asked them to headline a new evening of improv. Students often expressed surprise at how different their teaching styles were and took to saying \u201cyou\u2019re in the Sohn zone\u201d when seeing the couple work together.\nD.E.I.'s - Mo Munn & Ralph Hilaga\nWhen two besties land jobs at a prestigious company, they discover they\u2019re not there for their skills \u2014 they\u2019re the token hires. What follows is an improvised journey of chaos, corporate jargon, and an earnest attempt to prove they\u2019re more than just the diversity checkbox.\nFrom the chaotic minds of Wellington improv duo Mo and Ralph, D.E.I.\u2019s is a sharp, satirical, improvised workplace comedy about tokenism, identity, and the conundrums of modern day allyship.

Drawing from the techniques of silent film, it utilises silhouettes, smoke, puppetry, live music, and live animation. With the operation kept in sight, audiences see both the stage effects and how they are made. Combining hi-fi with lo-fi technology, and the mythic with the everyday, The Griegol is a show without words about death, love, and monsters. After winning Director, Composer, and Production of the Year at the 2022 Wellington Theatre Awards, and touring to the USA, The Griegol returns to the Hannah Playhouse this October.\n\nRecommended for ages 7+\nContains references to death and grief",

    "description": "The Monster in the Maze, The myth of the Minotaur is a tale almost as old as storytelling itself, but with The Monster in the Maze Jonathan Dove and Alisdair Middleton have excavated rich, new life from this classic. In this brand new staging by director Anapela Polataivao (Red White and Brass, Wild Dogs Under My Skirt), this story will be told as never before.\n\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he metes out his punishment in the cruellest way possible: by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth, to be fed to the terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze: the Minotaur. As King Minos triumphs, his great monster \u201cwill eat your future, it will rip your hope, it will stamp your youth, your children in the sand.\u201d\n\nAs the vindictive king will soon learn, however, these youth will not accept their fate without a fierce challenge. The Monster in the Maze is a story about resistance; about justice; about finding power not in oppression, but in collectivism. Fittingly, then, it\u2019s also a groundbreaking work in its form: a community-focused and community-driven opera in which young and community singers and players stand proudly shoulder-to-shoulder with their professional counterparts, and in which both are integral.\n\nThe Monster in the Maze has been roundly praised by audiences, participants and reviewers worldwide, and in its Aotearoa debut season, it will serve as a gorgeous articulation of New Zealand Opera\u2019s reciprocal community kaupapa.\n\nSung in English with surtitles.",

This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible.

It can also help in your realist drawing, painting and invented subjects and environments.

Give yourself a gift of a new creative hobby (or maybe even a career?) this spring!\n\nThe students start with basic ring making in copper or brass. We begin with ring making as this process teaches students many fundamental techniques in one project, measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting, soldering and finishing are all included in this one ring.\n\nStudents will learn how to measure their fingers to get an accurately sized ring, later they will also learn how to take sizing from existing rings. They are shown how to use a jeweller\u2019s saw to cut their metal to the correct length, how to form it up and how to solder.\n\nThen they learn how to shape their rings and finish them up into a wearable piece of jewellery, all in the first class!\n\nIn the first session they are also shown how to texture metals, cut and layer shapes, melt balls of silver and other techniques to create decorative elements.\n\nStudents can spend their evening thinking about and planning their design in silver for the next day. We encourage them to carefully plan this project and think about how they might make their piece before they begin, including creating drawings and notes. (We always say drawings don\u2019t need to be \u201cgood\u201d, they just need to make sense to the student and their tutor!). This project can be another ring, or earrings or pendants. We have a great selection of example pieces in the workshop so they can see what\u2019s achievable in the 3-hour time frame. Sometimes students can make more than one silver piece if they have enough time.\n\nIncluded in the class fee are copper and brass for practising on, up to 8 grams of sterling silver and all consumables such as sandpaper, solder and chemicals. Extra metals and chains are available for purchase in the studio.\n\nKids 12 and up are welcome in this class, any person under 16 years old must be accompanied by an enrolled caregiver.",

    "description": "Hands-on Sourdough Workshop, Sourdough for Beginners - $120 (paid via internet banking)\nCome join us for a hands-on, in-person sourdough workshop at Willow Corner Collective headquarters (aka my home)! This workshop is currently the only hands-on sourdough workshop being offered in the Nelson region - I teach and demonstrate to you and then you get to mix and practice on your own dough as we go along.\nWhether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this event is perfect for anyone looking to master the art of making sourdough bread, learning from someone who has 10+ years of experience. Perhaps you've found all the Youtube tutorials and Instagram how-to's overwhelming and are keen to learn via an in-person class. Then this is for you! I've baked hundreds of loaves in the last year alone, sold at a market, and hosted a pop-up shop. However, my passion really lies with teaching others to bake their own sourdough in their own homes, for their own families (or small businesses - one day!).You will be taught, demonstrated to, and then you get to have a go yourself; whilst learning my tips and tricks along the way. Plus we finish by sampling some delicious, fresh artisan sourdough with some favourite toppings!\nYou'll go home with all you need to make a good loaf of sourdough bread:\nKnowledge\nStudent Guide, including recipes and troubleshoot guide\nBowl, liner, bowl scraper, and razor blade... all the tools you'd need to make sourdough\nDough made in class to bake the next day at home, to wow your family/friends\nConfidence to continue the process yourself\nHealthy, bubbling starter to continue your journey at home\nContinued support and encouragement via our own private Facebook community group, for class attendees only\nNote: You will have your dough to take home after the workshop that will need shaping around 6-8pm, so please ensure that will work for you that day.Also, please double check the date when booking. If for some reason you are unable to attend on the day, due to time constraints, I am unable to refund your ticket. I am happy for you to send someone in your place, though. In extenuating circumstances I may be able to hold your ticket for a future workshop; this is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n*Payment to clear in bank account two days after ticket bought, after which time your ticket will be released on to someone else. Please pay immediately upon purchasing ticket.\n**All workshop info you need to know ahead of time is in the confirmation email. Please ensure you read this down to the bottom.\n***I recommend you already have a pair of digital scales, and a cast iron dutch oven at home to bake your loaf with as this makes the best, artisan sourdough, with great rise. Alternatively, a large, lidded casserole dish or enamel roasting pan work also. (The lids are a necessity).\n\n\"Sarah\u2019s sour dough class is for real life! Achieve beautiful delicious bread easily in your own kitchen. Sarah teaches you how to fit sourdough into your busy life. She clearly and passionately gives the essential information, tips and tricks to make your own loaf. I loved getting to have a go at each step in the process. I love Sarah\u2019s catchy philosophy \u201cThe goal is good bread, not perfect bread.\u201d This took all the pressure off, for me, and I left the class empowered with all the knowledge and skills needed to give it a go at home. I appreciated the thoughtful and well prepared resources Sarah gave us. Thank you!\" - Megan\n\n\"Sourdough with Sarah was a delight! From feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the idea of ever making my own loaf of sourdough, to dancing with joy as i watch a beautiful perfect sourdough loaf get nice and golden in the homewood stove!The information was packaged in bite sizes with hands on practice in between, where we all got to experience each step of the whole process, which was cleverly condensed and prepared so that despite normally having waits in between, we were able to see it all play out in a short few hours!The process was beautifully organised with attention to detail that had us fawning, came away feeling so blessed and privileged!Sarah's glowing personality made all the information feel easy and palatable, it was so fun!Such a lovely time, great environment to learn with ease.\" -Melody",

    "description": "Jewellery-making in 4 weeks - Saturday Mornings, Level 2+, This class is for students at level 2 or higher and is not open to beginners. This advanced class is ideal for those who are already competent at soldering simple joins, annealing, and basic tool use on their own. Students must have completed a minimum of two 4-week blocks or one 6-week block. If you are unsure of your level, please contact us for advice.\n\nAn advanced set of students means that your tutor can support you to take on more exciting and complex challenges. They will work with the group to find appropriate projects. Each 4-week block may focus on a particular skill topic, rather than covering many different topics for each student.\n\nLevel 2 students will learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project to hone their skills. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet, or a more complex bezel setting.\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple, self-directed projects to work on in class.\n\nPlease note that this class fee does not include materials.

Our popular weeknight classes are the best way for beginners to get into jewellery-making in a lively, warm, and friendly environment.\n\nThe stone-setting process teaches you many fundamental techniques in one project! We start with basic ring-making and stone-setting in copper or brass. Students will learn measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting, and soldering. Then we move on to making a practice ring set with a cabochon stone (a cabochon has a flat bottom and a smooth, domed top) in a bezel setting.\n\nAs you work through your practice ring and setting, you can move on to working in silver and produce another ring with a cabochon stone that you really love. This way, you will learn the basics on your practice ring before taking the next step in costly silver.\n\nThis class has all materials included in the class fee. Each student receives a carefully curated materials pack, including copper or brass, sterling and fine silver for your ring-making projects, as well as two stones from our supply so you get a good stone for your level of experience.

This is our Women's (13+) class called ROAR.\nThese classes are about empowering you for life.

    "description": "Women's MINDSET Self-Defence Workshop - Wellington, Women's MINDSET Self-Defence Workshop - Wellington\nOur women's workshop is probably the most intense, comprehensive, enjoyable & hands-on self-defence syllabus in New Zealand & Australia.\n\nAbout this Event\n\nThe workshop is rated R13 so only those aged 13 and above can attend due to the content taught. There are a limited amount of spaces available so book early.\n\nDon't let the price deceive you; we're firm believers that every woman and family deserves the opportunity to participate in workshops like this without having to break the bank.\n\nSo, what sort of things can you expect to learn at this workshop?\n\nYou learn the vital parts of the body - parts of the body that are vulnerable & easy to attack.\nLearn how to block an attack confidently.\nLearn how to defend yourself against slaps, punches, pushes & grabs.\nLearn to defend yourself against headlocks, hair grabbing, and wrist grabs.\nLearn how to defend yourself against chokeholds, and bear hugs.\nLearn how to defend yourself on the ground.\nLearn effective rape defence techniques.\nLearn how to use your hands, legs, knees & elbows as weapons.\nLearn to defend yourself against many other types of attacks with confidence.\n\nPlus, lots, lots more. (depending on the time allowed & the participant's progression)\nWhat we teach is how to deal with the worst-case scenario, when the awareness, avoidance and de-escalation have failed, it all turns physical, there's no obvious way to escape & you must fight back.\n\n\"... a massive shout out to Charlie Riley for all the amazing work he does. Charlie, you are a champion among champions. Thank you. Ladies, if you loved #reebokunleashed or if you missed out, please check out Charlie and find a course near you.\"\nZoe Bell - Hollywood Stunt Woman, Actress & Producer\n\nThis is the sixteenth year that we've been running our women's workshop for the community in New Zealand and this is the second year in Australia. All you need to take with you is a positive attitude, comfortable clothing, a drinks bottle & towel plus something to eat during the breaks.

They're designed to help you build your cultural responsiveness and improve your ability to engage meaningfully with Pacific communities. Talanoa is a Pacific style of deep dialogue, with a focus on how we connect to each other and strengthen relationships, while still being able to share honest and effective insights. If you want to strengthen your capability in this space, to create transformational change, and to enhance your relationships with people from different communities - this workshop is your chance to grow.\nWhat will I gain from Together in Dialogue?\nIn Together in Dialogue, you will share meaningful conversations around Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the role and responsibilities of Pasifika as allies. By engaging in deep talanoa, you will explore cultural, historical, and contemporary implications of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and how Pasifika people can strengthen this unique relationship and promote cultural awareness.\nThis is a 3 hour in-person learning experience.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThese learning experiences are for both Paci\ufb01c professionals and those from other communities. You don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge or experience in this area - we\u2019ll meet you where you are and provide a welcoming, supportive environment for you to learn.\nCultural responsiveness is for everyone.

If you think this professional development might be right for you, it is!\nCost\nWhen work is busy and budgets are tight, cultural responsiveness can often take a backseat. But this is an a\ufb00ordable investment that will help you address the challenges that so many of us share, like how to build engagement and trust, and avoid relationship missteps. It\u2019s not a buzzword; it\u2019s a vital skill if you want to better meet the needs of the people you serve. Price: $170 (inc GST) per person, including morning tea.\nFacilitator\nOur team\u2019s extensive research and experience feed into these sessions, with a focus on interactive activities and practical, real-life examples.

On both floors you\u2019ll find a series of balistraria, tightly angled gun slots through which members of the militia would defend their posts.\n\nKeep an eye out, too, for an exposed panel where you can see the fine gravel that was packed between the exterior weatherboards and inch-thick interior boards to absorb the impact of answering gunfire. Don\u2019t be fooled by the windows \u2013 they were added later. Originally, the loop holes you\u2019ll spy on the walls were the only way to see out.\n\nInside the Blockhouse, there\u2019s an exhibition from Whirinaki Whare Taonga, telling the early story of Upper Hutt and its Blockhouse.\n\nWe will have some knowledgeable people available to share stories, answer questions and some light refreshments. Drop in between 11-1pm and stay as long as you like!\n\n\nBooking is REQUIRED.\nCost: $10 - $15\nBooking information here: https://wellingtonheritagefestival.co.nz/event/visit-the-upper-hutt-blockhouse/\n\n\nHealth & Safety:\nPlease note as an historic building the Upper Hutt Blockhouse is not suitable for those with accessibility needs.\n\n",

The catch is, you have to pair it with a salsa that you make yourself. There are no limits on the style of cocktail you want this time around, so get creative!\nIf you would like to participate, get in touch with me or Dan ASAp as we were running low on time to organize this time around.\nMinimum 30ml of Tequila must be used in the drink and as always must be the hero spirit of the night.\nYou will be making two drinks for the judges to try and 5 minutes to make two servings of your cocktail and serve your salsa.\nThe judges may also be coerced with bribes and favours during your presentation.\nThe event will be on 28th of September and the competition will start at 6pm.\nIf you have any questions about the competition, please ask either me or Dan.\nThe main aim of this cocktail competition is to help those who may not have entered comps before, gain a bit of confidence and experience, or for people who haven\u2019t entered a comp in a while, to shake off those cobwebs.\nIt also a chance to meet new people and introduce newcomers to the Wellington bar scene. Most of all the idea is to have fun!\nEach competitor will have 5 minutes to make and present two servings of their drink.\nAll Tequila and corn chips for your salsa will be provided, but you will have to source your own ingredients including citrus and sugar syrup. Glassware and ice will be provided, you are more than welcome to bring specialty equipment and ingredients, however you will be marked on how easy your drink is to replicate.\nThe competition will be judged by a panel of 3 judges. While knowing your stuff is important, brand knowledge is not the key here. This comp is to engage bartenders in a fun comp environment, so drink and personality are just as important.\nCompetitors will be first come first serve, so message either me or Dan if you want to be entered, there are 10 spots for the night and there will be prizes for the winner.\nThere will be drink deals on the night, and make sure you bring your friends, workmates, parents ect ect to cheer you on and heckle the other competitors\u2026\nSee you all there!\n\n",

    "description": "6-12 In person PLD, The story of Communication and Signs is one of the five great stories which scaffold the learning in Montessori classrooms for the 6-12 year old child. It traces the beginnings of human communication and the development of writing.\nHow can we as educators encourage writing in our Montessori environments and ensure collaborations and an understanding of the basic writing processes, bring success and enthusiasm to the telling of powerful stories?\nWhat are some of the stumbling blocks for children when researching? How can we provide strategies and structure to enable lively and informative information writing?\nIn this day-long face to face workshop, with a focus on guidance for narrative and information writing, participants will be invited into the world of learning to write. Strategies and exercises to stimulate interest and action for writers will be given, alongside challenges and advanced crafting lessons for more fluent writers in 6-9 and 9-12 classrooms. We will examine elements of structuring, elaboration, character and place, revision, and author techniques. Note taking and writing for research will be included in an information writing session.\nDay 2: Sunday 14th September\nCome prepared to share your collective wisdom while we align NZC History curriculum to what we do in our classrooms to ensure that everything is covered. By September we will also have a better idea of where the conventional system is headed with the new-look maths coming out. We will spend time unpacking the the WHY we do what we do.\nThis is an opportunity for you to discuss, share ideas and gain ideas for ways forward. ",

Dame Anne Salmond writes of \u2018competing cosmologies\u2019 and \u2018ontological collisions\u2019 \u2014 European missionaries arriving in Aotearoa in the early 19th century brought a Biblical cosmology that began such a collision.

Walk through the gates of Rathkeale College on 1st November and be welcomed by a diverse range of colourful stalls, the aroma of freshy cooked food and plenty of festive inspiration.\n\nNow in its 22nd year, the Christmas F\u00eate has become a must-do event on the Wairarapa spring calendar. Stallholders travel from around the North Island to sell their wares and offer Christmas shoppers loads of inspiration. From festive decorations, clothing, arts and crafts, to flowers, toys and plants \u2013 there is something for everyone.\n\nGourmet food is always a highlight at the F\u00eate - think freshly made gourmet burgers, lamb & mint sausages, wraps, curry, salads, and the ever-popular berries & ice-cream - there is always a huge variety of flavours to tempt the taste buds. Devonshire Teas and home baking served in the Rathkeale Homestead rose garden is a time-honoured tradition while refreshing cold drinks can be sipped on as visitors listen to live music performed by students at various times throughout the day. The popular Christmas cake stall features again this year - but visitors are encouraged to get in early as the cakes often sell out by midday.\n\nThe beauty of this F\u00eate is that it\u2019s a day out for the whole family. In addition to the 120 plus stalls, there is plenty to entertain the children including facepainting and magic shows throughout the day.\n\nVisitors can also explore the beautiful, expansive grounds of Rathkeale College including the school gardens designed by Alfred Buxton, the Greek Amphitheatre and the 3km eco-trail which weaves through large stands of native trees, including ancient kahikatea.\n\nEftpos is available, but we strongly recommend that visitors bring cash.\n\nKoha/gold coin entry.\nRathkeale College is a five-minute drive north of Masterton in the Wairarapa.",

Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub ",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, 2025 Taiwan Update Lectures\nJoin us for three talks by experts on different aspects of Taiwan\n\nAbout this Event\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\n\n\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\n\n\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 01:00 PM - 02:00 PM\nTaiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nInfo: In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:00 PM - 02:15 PM\nCoffee Break\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:15 PM - 03:15 PM\nWhat does Taiwan's two-level politics tell us?\nInfo: This presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:15 PM - 03:45 PM\nAfternoon Tea\nInfo: Please join us outside AM103 for some light refreshments\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:45 PM - 04:45 PM\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nInfo: This talk explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games.

    "description": "Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal International Order, Abstract\nOver the last decade, China has punished countries that undermine its territorial claims and foreign policy goals with measures such as restricting trade, encouraging popular boycotts, and cutting off tourism. These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods.

(Burst blood vessels in the brain).\n-Blood thinning medication. (Unfortunately, the blood thinners used to prevent such blood clots can increase the risk of bleeding in the brain, a cause of hemorrhagic stroke).\n-Pregnancy or possible pregnancy\n-Asthma\n-Mental Contraindications\n-Substance dependence & addiction (Deep breathwork journeys are not always appropriate for those who are still addicted to a substance, as it tends to raise suppressed or repressed material for processing. However, if you\u2019re currently in recovery, this can be extremely healing, and help you discover the deeper patterns that gave rise to this addiction. (Grof, 1985: 267 \u2013 268).\n-Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or psychosis\n-Hospitalisation for emotional crises in the last 10 years\n-Psychological conditions and diagnoses, which preclude safe emotional release.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the above, please inform Sarah.\n\n*Tickets are non-refundable, but are transferrable with 24 hours notice required.\n\n",

Leave inspired.\n\nInvestment\n$75 (includes all drawing materials, yoga, mat hire, drinks & nibbles)\n\nAll supplies & props provided \u2014 wear comfortable clothing to move in!",

While there\u2019s no obligation to stay for dinner, sharing a meal together offers a meaningful way to strengthen connections. Andre and Sri Jiva co-host this circle with a shared passion for creating authentic, supportive spaces where men can connect deeply\u2014offering this gathering simply because they believe in its importance.\n\nThe Men\u2019s Circle provides a safe and nurturing environment where men can share openly, express their feelings, and encourage personal growth\u2014free from societal pressures to be stoic or self-reliant.

That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\n\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling.

This workshop is being held in Wellington so for those living outside the region, why not make it a weekend away to learn, explore new ideas, fresh inspiration and make lasting connections \ufffd\nLink to sign up below. Be quick as the venue has limited spaces!\n[https://forms.gle/Rm42pgFLCadBZFVQ7](https://forms.gle/Rm42pgFLCadBZFVQ7)\nWe probably don't say this enough - but we truly believe our work as ECE educators matters. It matters because the formative years of a child is very important- it influences their mental and emotional wellbeing.

Whether you are single or partnered, whether your past experiences were harmonious or painful, each relationship reflects the inner dance of the masculine and feminine within us.\n\nThroughout history, these sacred energies\u2014Yin and Yang\u2014were meant to complement and support each other. Yet, distortions, suppression, and separation have created wounds that echo through generations. Many of us carry beliefs such as:\n\nMen cannot be trusted.\nWomen are not safe.\nLove must be earned.\n......\n\nRarely do we pause to sit with these wounds and meet the unhealed parts of our inner feminine and masculine. These energies may hold not only personal pain but also ancestral imprints passed down through time\u2014shaping the way we experience love and connection today.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f In this mini workshop, you will be guided through a shamanic journey to explore and heal your inner archetypes. Together, we will:\n\n\u2728 Release old wounds and limiting patterns carried by the inner feminine or masculine.\n\u2728 Make peace with the shadow side of our psyche.\n\u2728 Embody the wholeness of the Divine Masculine and Feminine within.\n\nWe will close our circle with a sacred forgiveness ritual, bridging the separation and returning to a state of balance, wholeness, and love.\n\nThis journey is open to everyone\u2014whether you are new to shamanic work or have walked this path before. All that is required is an open heart and willingness to connect deeply within.\n\n\ud83c\udf38 You\u2019ll leave with:\n\nA renewed sense of love and harmony within yourself.\nGreater balance between your inner masculine and feminine.\nA deeper connection to spirit, self, and the essence of oneness.\n\nEvent Details\n\ud83d\udcc5 Saturday, September 27th\n\ud83d\udd52 3:00\u20136:00 pm\n\ud83d\udccd Lotus Yoga Centre \u2013 Sanctuary, Paraparaumu\n\ud83d\udcab Energy Exchange: $55 per person\n\ud83c\udf3f Limited to 12 participants\n\n\u2728What to bring:\nA water bottle, journal, cushion or blanket for comfort.\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Rides from Wellington may be arranged\u2014please contact me if needed.Contact: 0272541272\n\nAbout Your Guide - Fery Qiu\n\nI am a Shamanic Healer who is committed to the healing path that help people heal from the core of their being. From suicidal depression to shamanic path, my spirituality is not based on how many trainings, meditations, and ceremonies I have done, it\u2019s coming from a deep embodied experience to transform pain into wisdom and empowerment. The shamanic path is a way of being; we allow ourselves to go deeper within to connect all things that come from oneness. I loved my work, which has been proven to help people really change their lives. If you are curious about what this mini workshop could bring, having an open mind and open heart, you will be surprised by how much can be done just in this brief journey within.\n\n\n\nWith love,\nFery Qiu\n\n",

When triggered, these unconscious \u201cprograms\u201d hijack our reactions, leaving us feeling stuck even when we want to move forward. In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore how trauma influences the nervous system and why awareness alone isn\u2019t enough to create lasting change.\n\nIn this 75 minute workshop, you\u2019ll discover how trauma impacts the nervous system and learn FasterEFT tools to release triggers, reframe old memories, and reset your stress response. You\u2019ll walk away with simple, science-backed practices you can use every day to build resilience and emotional freedom.\n\n\u201cThis is an interactive workshop where you\u2019ll connect with others.

Each Tuesday is a new event. Most will try for fortnightly.\nSmall groups: 8 men + 2 experienced hosts\nInclusive: all ages, backgrounds and identities (18+)\nIt's about connection and showing up, instead of going it alone.

No fixing, preaching, or pressure. It\u2019s not a crisis service or a substitute for professional care. The sign-up form explains this in more detail.\nYou can expect to:\nPractice listening and learn communication skills for life\nDiscover greater integrity and self-accountability\nBe supported in building your emotional intelligence\nBecome a part of a hearty and diverse community\nHave a good time - it\u2019s often uplifting and inspiring.\nJoseph and your team of hosts have all been in regular men's groups for many years.

It\u2019s also just a different & cool way of meeting new people by getting a bit out of your comfort zone and skipping the small talk!\nJoin us for games, talks, and connections with friends you haven\u2019t met yet. Join if you get annoyed after being asked what you do, where you are from, and how long you have been in Wellington every single time you meet someone. If you feel that there are better questions in life then this is the place for you.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nWe start with a short & sweet intro talk followed by a few light-hearted group games to warm up. Don't worry, nothing too awkward! After that, we split you up into small groups and start with the conversation rounds (with 3-4 people). We'll have awesome question cards that will guide the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll never have to speak in public if you don\u2019t want to!\n\nHOW TO JOIN?\nTake 2 minutes to fill out our form\n\nhttps://lu.ma/ftstwellington6\nOur events are limited to 30 handpicked guests to ensure a cozy atmosphere. We prioritize a balance in gender and cultural diversity, making each gathering a unique blend of perspectives! If you're invited you'll receive an invite with a special link via our ticketing platform Luma\n\nHOW MUCH IS IT?\nThe cost to attend is NZD 23 (early llama) - NZD 25 (general llama) and includes the following:\n3 hours of facilitated and curated activities\nLight snacks to keep the energy going (only if outdoors)\nA space to meet new people in the least boring way possible\nSupporting our mission to slowly eliminate small talk around the world\nAlso includes those pesky ticket fees!\n\nWHERE IS IT?\nWe host our events in awesome cafes, rooftops, and bars across the city. We only reveal the location to ticket holders 24 hours before the event.\n\nWHAT THEY SAY\n\u201cGreat way to connect with people in a more meaningful way. Get to the heart of the matter, dive straight into what really counts!\u201d - Matthias\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of activity humanity needs every weekend. Thank you for all.\u201d - Sonya\n\n\u201cF*ck the Small Talk changes the narrative from \"Where are you from?\" to \"When was the last time you laughed uncontrollably?\" and I think that's beautiful.\u201d - Monika\n\n\u201cI loved F*ck the small talk, I was a little bit nervous at first but they are pros at making you feel comfortable with the rest of the group, the activities are really fun and I enjoyed every second (consider that the one who's saying this is very, very shy). Give it a try!\u201d - Brenda\n\n\"it\u2019s a wonderful experience, it\u2019s like being a kid again, when you were at the park, playing with other kids, and just decided you were going to be best friends for the next hours. Maybe you\u2019ll never see those kids again. But that hour was amazing because you both opened up and trusted each other.\" - Sara\n\n\u201cLively, interesting, introspective, completely open and no judgement. Everyone that joined was ready for great conversation and helped with different perspectives. So much fun! I can't wait for the next one! \u201c - Yaz\n\nCheck out our 100+ Google reviews: https://goo.gl/maps/TpZy77bfPFkGoikn7\n\nFAQ\n\u2022 Can I come alone?\nOf course, in fact, we encourage it! 99% of people do.\n\n\u2022 I signed up but never got an invite. Why?\nWe usually get a high volume of sign-ups yet we like to keep it cozy & only about 30 people. We believe this is a good number to ensure an awesome experience! Please try again next time if do not receive an invite - no hard feelings\n\n\u2022 Why do you charge?\nWe value our time and put a lot of love, planning, and effort into creating & designing these experiences.\nThis is our project/business and what we give to the world and we think everything should be a fair exchange! However, money should never be the reason for people not to attend. If you can\u2019t afford it simply get in touch with us\n\n\u2022 I'm digging this! Can I get involved somehow?\nSure thing, send us a message!\n\n\u2022 Can I bring my cute dog/llama?\nIt depends on where the event is! Message us to make sure.

Over the past seven years, his research has focused on developing a site-specific and responsive approach to photographic interventions within the landscape.\nDrawing inspiration from scientific 'fieldwork,' Kay\u2019s practice involves close observation and data collection, using these methods to uncover new insights into specific environments. However, his approach extends beyond the typical scientific framework by leveraging the unique possibilities of the photographic medium. This process enables him to move beyond the traditional, idealized representation of landscapes, offering deeper, more complex interpretations.\nSeptember 25, Tararua Tramping Club (4 Moncrieff St, Mt Victoria), Doors Open at 7pm\nIf you\u2019re curious about the Wellington Photographic Society, you\u2019re welcome to attend two meetings for free before deciding whether to join.

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\n$7.50 each or multiples of 3 $20\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

Experienced Christchurch based musos - Tim Kent (vocals, acoustic guitar); Justin 'Rusty' White (lead guitar); Jo-Anne Davern Fuller (vocals, keyboard); Chiara Lowe (violin, vocals); Adam Lowe (bass); Mark Newburn (drums, percussion).\nThe members of BANDIT QUEEN are passionate about this project and invite you to come experience and enjoy the eclectic music of USA indie-rock band THE DECEMBERISTS.",

O vast and silent peace!\nSo tief im Abendrot So deep in sunset glow,\nWie sind wir wanderm\u00fcde- How weary we are with wandering-\nIst dies etwa der Tod? Could this perhaps be death?\n\nFor this special premiere performance, Salina Fisher has arranged the 'Four Last Songs' for NZTrio and celebrated Australian soprano Emma Pearson.",

A skilled guitarist, Saali rarely plays straight ahead chords, and an\neducation in jazz has informed his ear for harmony, the beauty of dissonance, tension and\nresolution, with unconventional song structures, alternate tunings and intriguing melodies.\nAlthough not adverse to penning the odd love song, most of Saali\u2019s lyrics tend to focus on\nother aspects of the human condition, from religion and politics to our relationships with the\nenvironment and our own minds.

We\u2019ve traded bands and tunes across the Tasman. The team of famous Kiwi musicians at Come Together are now putting it all to the test. Kiwi vs Oz Rock Big End of Year Bash 2025 packs the biggest hits from both sides of the ditch onto one stage. Some of New Zealand\u2019s most iconic rock musicians will tear through these legendary antipodean tracks in an all-out rock fest. You can decide who truly owns rock. Is it the swagger of Aussie pub rock or the grit and heart of Kiwi anthems? Perhaps it\u2019s both. \nGet ready to hear the biggest tunes from AC/DC, Split Enz, Cold Chisel, The Datsuns, INXS, DD Smash, Silverchair, Australian Crawl, and Hello Sailor. That\u2019s just for starters, so the showdown is set to be epic. Here\u2019s the kicker \u2014 you help shape the setlist, and when the amps power down, you vote for which nation takes home the crown. \nThis is more than a concert \u2014 it\u2019s a massive celebration of the music we grew up to, the songs that built us, and the riffs that still get us moving. Grab your mates, grab your tickets, and get ready to make some noise.",

Before adopting the moniker in 2023, Ryan Connaghan had been prolifically writing music that communicated their experiences in life, love, and loneliness. These themes are all approached on songs like \u201cLast One\u201d and \u201cMe & My Friends\u201d \u2013 the first offerings from First Reserve\u2019s debut EP set for release in late 2025. On stage, their sound is both intimate and larger-than-life, combining influences from alt-rock, indie-folk, and pop.\n\nDropper combines intuitive songwriting sensibilities with wall-of-sound, guitar.  Blending noise and melody, Dropper is dynamic, song-centred, high-energy indie rock. Often compared to Bob Mould\u2019s work with H\u00fcsker D\u00fc or Lou Barlow's early Sebadoh, they\u2019ve been described by one review as having a \"high energy stage performance punctuated by flawless musicianship and songwriting skills that seems beyond the years...Honestly, it\u2019s hard to overstate how impressed I was with Dropper and am eagerly awaiting my next chance to see them live.\u201d\n\nElly Mae's music encapsulates the bittersweet complexities of growth, relationships, time escaping, and the nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, shoegaze and whatnot.\n\nGrab your general release tickets online for just $15! Or, even better, grab an early bird ticket for only $10 and secure your spot for a night of unforgettable live music. Doors at 8pm, first act on at 8:30pm. ",

Playing Wellington\u2019s San Fran on Saturday 11 April, followed by The Powerstation in Auckland on Sunday 12 April. \nTickets on sale Thursday 2 October 12pm from helmetmusic.com\nHelmet has built a reputation as one of the most commanding forces in the underground scene. Born at the dawn of the rage-filled 90\u2019s, Helmet fiercely holds space for multiple generations of alternative fans seeking the vital energy of hostile riffs and inventive metronomic groove. With a refusal to fit neatly into a genre, Helmet\u2019s music creates an atmosphere best known live; part industrial, part hip-hop, part existential sermon. \n\nFormed in 1989 in NYC by Page Hamilton, Helmet has been crushing stages for over three decades. In that time they have only come to Aotearoa / NZ a handful of times, most recently in 2023 during their sold out Best of Helmet 1989-2023 tour, with 13th Floor declaring \u201ca complete evening of essential music from one of heavy music\u2019s most essential bands.\u201d With 35 years of rocking behind them, Helmet are at the top of their game.

Italian pianist and composer Ludovico Einaudi is returning to Wellington with a new album to explore with audiences. The Michael Fowler Centre will be filled with Ludovico\u2019s special mix of neo-classical, pop, ambient, rock, and experimental styles. His modern soundscapes are renowned for being able to cross artistic and generational boundaries. Because of this, he has become one of the world\u2019s most-streamed classical music artists. \nLudovico began composing in the 1980s for theatre and ballet. He has since gone on to write for film and television and produce multi-million-selling albums. His most recent is \u2018The Summer Portraits\u2019. Written in 2025, it is the result of a cascade of personal memories triggered by sun, summer, and family holidays. Here, he returns to the lush full-band textures of earlier works.

He is joined in Wellington by drummer extraordinaire Isaac Levi Tucker, producer-performer-poet Miss Leading, Raiatea synth artist Gotal Bournier and dancer Tokyo dancer Misako Kikuchi.\n\nPeter Hobbs\nKnown for his award-winning cinematic and emotional body of work in recordings and immersive art works, Hobbs' new album Panpsychism is a vehicle for his masterful songwriting driven by experimental beats on a highway of immersive synth soundscapes, through an immersive visual-reactive world.\nHe is performing his modular synths and immersive AV show alongside legendary percussionist and drummer Isaac Levi Tucker.\nMiss Leading\nAn electronic music producer, singer and poet. Her music aims to widen your mind while moving your body with a mix of pop, hip-hop, spoken ambient and dance tracks with a conscious perspective in relation to race, feminism, sexuality and environment. Her debut album Minor Thing received five-star reviews and gained critical acclaim by independent music magazines across the UK, Brazil, Germany and the USA, including being labelled UK Artist of the Week by The Vinyl District.\n\nGotal Bournier\nGotal Bournier is a French electronic musician living between Tahiti and Tokyo. Between 2012 and 2017 he released four albums in Japan with the band Lo-shi. Since 2018 he has been based on the island of Ra\u02bbi\u0101tea, working on solo recordings and various live collaborative projects. His current solo project is a playful and wryly nostalgic live soundtrack to a video collage of Cold War Era science fiction films using the spectral, alien tones of twin modular synthesisers.\n\nMisako Kikuchi\nAfter studying classical ballet at an early age, Tokyo-born dancer Misako Kikuchi went on to explore modern ballet, contemporary dance, street dance and flamenco, while refining her own improvisational approach. Her performances create uncontrived moments of beauty that make you feel that being alive is not irreconcilable with being free\n\n",

The lyrics paint loathsome, frightening images of pitch-black self-hatred and the frailty of the human experience. These musical manifestations only serve to cement their already legendary status. Having not been in Australia and New Zealand since 2008, PIG DESTROYER\u2019s long overwaited return has just one goal. To unnerve the unprepared with a deranged, grisly intensity which very few, if any, can match.\nRecently reforming to the original line-up, Singapore\u2019s WORMROT resume their genius in unleashing exquisite noise together, with the announcement of a new album 'TNT'. Grinding faces with the best of them, their performances are intense, spectacular, furious, with a barrage of unrelenting, head-caving abuse, honed by a singular determination to destroy the competition.\nwww.facebook.com/TheRealPigDestroyer\n\nwww.facebook.com/wormrot\n\nwww.swdpresents.com ",

    "description": "Raven Mavens Quartette in concert, Raven Mavens Quartette\nSuppose you can imagine the sound of the blues, spiced by flavours of the American songbook, folk, country, and even the rock and roll of Jerry Lee Lewis, driven by the unmistakable sound of boogie woogie piano. In that case, you have the Raven Mavens Quartette.  \n\nIt is both an accident and it isn\u2019t that this is an all-female group. The group had its genesis a decade ago when piano player and singer-songwriter Cindy Muggeridge encountered the singing and clarinet skills of Marian Carter. They formed the Raven Mavens as a duo that included a core of folk and blues, and exploited the singing talents of the pair through finely crafted harmonies.  \n\nThe success of their combination in playing local gigs and folk festivals opened up opportunities with other musicians, and the next step was the inclusion of drummer Anje Glindemann, who has played in a list of local bands, including Tin Pan Alley, Hen Picked and more recently the Salty Hearts. Anje can also be seen performing with Kapiti Coast singer-songwriter icon Andrew London.  And finally, the addition of multi-instrumentalist Kate Marshall. \u201cKate is an amazing player\u201d, Cindy says. \u201cShe can move as easily from piano accordion, to fiddle or flute, depending on what the song calls for - or she feels like playing!\u201d And of course, like the other members of the group, she sings.  \n\nThe instrumental diversity of the line-up was now established, but what also distinguishes this group is the addition of Cindy Muggeridge\u2019s original songs to the set. \u201cWriting my own songs has been part of the musical journey for me\u201d, says Cindy, \u201cand it just led naturally to offering some of them to the other singers in the group\u201d. The \u201cfun\u201d of their music and the unmistakable presence of four female musical masters is what they will be sharing when they play at The Offering as part of Greytown ArtTown.\n\nBuy tickets in advance here or txt bookings to 02102361951.\n\nPlease note The Offering is fully licensed and will be serving snacks and drinks. Please note this concert replaces Bob McNeill and Emily Roughton due to illness.",

Located on the eastern side of Antananarivo, the capital, the orphanage was founded by the incredible Madame Hary in 2012. What started as a humble project from her own home has grown into a haven for 54 children, some of whom were rescued from areas where twins are sadly believed to be cursed.\nDespite the challenges, the orphanage continues to thrive, relying entirely on the kindness of visitors. They grow their own rice, maintain a small chicken farm, and have a vegetable garden to sustain themselves. But their greatest need is for ongoing support and resources to continue providing for these beautiful children.\nBy attending our concert, you\u2019ll be helping make a direct impact on the lives of these children.

Releases have landed on global and regional editorial playlists. His EPs\u2014Fantasy, Monarch, SugarCoated and now F.O.M.O \u2014have consistently showcased his range and evolution as an artist.\nSig Wilder & Friends blend kiwi authenticity with American grit, bringing you a well-worn handwritten journal of lived experiences rendered through metaphor, poetic prose, and the stylistic conventions of folk, alt-country and late-night heartbreak radio.\nJosh Glennie is a soulful singer/songwriter based in Wellington, New Zealand. He's made a name for himself playing in bands around Wellington and is now striking out with his own solo material. Together with Tarn, they have produced a new EP of songs that cut to the bone, focused around acoustic guitar and Josh's striking vocals. His New EP is expected late 2025/early 2026. ",

What if swamp rock wasn't born in Louisiana, but in Takaka you ask? What if Iggy Pop and the Stooges had been Marlborough dairy farmers? What if Hendrix had settled in a Tukurua art gallery selling homemade jewellery crafted from shells and bone? The answer to all these questions and more can be found at a Cowpokers gig: a raw, barn-storming, rural-rock-and-roll sensation that 23 years of gigging has utterly failed to hone, polish, or refine.\nTYSON SMITH: Wellington-based guitarist/singer/songwriter Tyson Smith will be bringing his unique, original music combining elements of rock, blues, folk, world music and freeform improvisation.\nTyson has worked as a guitarist with acts ranging from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to vocalist Hollie Smith, before focusing on his own music in the last few years.\nIn 2024 he celebrated 10 years since the release of his album The Hollow Tree with Rick Cranson and Ed Zuccollo, and released his new single Wolves. Tyson has been performing regularly around various New Zealand venues and festivals with his raw and exciting sound both with the trio and solo (utilising multiple amps and a bass drum). ",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.

Playing two exclusive shows only at Auckland\u2019s Tuning Fork and San Fran in Wellington on the 11th and 12th respectively.\nAfter initially calling it a day in 1999, the Jesus Lizard officially return full time to save us from the current state of musical mediocrity with their latest album, Rack. A blistering resurgence of the so-called \u2018noise rock\u2019 they helped define alongside contemporaries Big Black, Flipper, The Birthday Party, with their previous and most noted albums Head, Goat and Liar. For those of us who live in fear of the reunion album and subsequent tour, the Jesus Lizard thankfully display not only the same chaotic and dark nihilism of their earlier careers but also the maturity and seasoning of a band riding a wave of renewed and reinvigorated form.\nOnce slated by famed engineer Steve Albini as \u201cthe greatest band I\u2019ve ever seen\u2019 the Jesus Lizard not only lived up to this lofty praise in their prime but continue to do so in their advancing years. David Yow still leads the charge as the maniacally possessed frontman entering crowds with reckless abandon and a stamina that much younger vocalists would kill for. The original rhythm section of David Wm Sims and Mac McNeilly further continue to prove why they were and are the best bass & drum combo since Jones and Bonham, anchoring the ship as Captain Yow and first mate Denison navigate the wild seas of their songs. And while he may not always feature (as he rightly should) on many modern music journalists \u2018best guitarists lists\u2019, Duane Denison could perhaps be the most innovative and idiosyncratic punk rock guitarist EVER. However, each member is a sum of their parts but combined they are as Albini also once said \u201cthe purest melding of the sublime and profane.\u201d\nWhether you are a longtime disciple of the Jesus Lizard, seeing them when last here in \u201898, or perhaps your fandom is more recent and have only seen videos of their legendary live performances, you will know that these shows are not to be missed.\nTickets available Thursday 8TH May at 12pm from:\nSaturday 11th October 2025 - The Tuning Fork, Auckland (All ages):\nhttps://moshtix.co.nz/.../the-jesus-lizard-nz-tour.../180227\nSunday 12th October 2025 - San Fran, Wellington (R18 unless accompanied by your legal guardian)",

With a string of releases on Berlin-based PHTM, T\u0101maki Makaurau-based Gypnotica, and an impressive catalog of self-releases, he consistently showcases his singular and original interpretation of dance music.\nInstagram.com/e.li\nelihoff.bandcamp.com\nabyssalsoundworks.bandcamp.com\n\nHUNTER \u2014 Hang the Saints / Haven\nRaised in Kaik\u014dura, Aotearoa, Hunter's dark and atmospheric sound often contrasts the beautiful environment she grew up in. Her direct approach to techno draws influence from heavy percussion, bold rhythm and industrial soundscapes. After spending two years finding inspiration in clubs overseas, she has returned to \u014ctautahi with a refined style that\u2019s ready to make people dance. As the co-founder of \u201cHang The Saints\u201d and resident of \u201cHaven\u201d, Hunter is all about creating safe, inclusive spaces for people to connect through the music she loves.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sspoonsnake/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hunter-mccrory-334790608\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/bC3qeA6pUxBoMo7P9\n\nLUDUS & RIZZO \u2014 Tonic Collective\nTonic Collective is the recent endeavour of Ludus and Rizzo, inspired by the people, places and spaces of their experience touring China with BIRDPARTY and Vera Ellen. Both acts are individually known for their versatile and innovative sound, bringing a wide range of influences and inspirations to the dancefloor. In the short time since establishing the collective, they\u2019ve already hosted Kaishandao and Bone Chapel, established a space, and debuted a monthly radio show on Mouthfull that explores sound from across the genre spectrum, both in the club and out.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ludus.etc/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alicerizzoofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tonic.collective/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/l-s.../416life-support-cl1n1c-chengdu\nhttps://soundcloud.com/racquetclub-info/mix-series-016-ludus\n\nSHLI \u2014 Echo Train Records / Warehouse Rave / Holding Hands\nShli is the alias of \u014ctautahi-via-P\u014dneke DJ and Producer Tim Ward. Steadily releasing works over recent years through local labels like Echo Train and the Big Fresh Collective, he is carving out a sound of his own.\nStitching together infectious rhythms layered over low-end pressure, Shli\u2019s sets draw influence from across the hardcore continuum and beyond. Creating dancefloor moments from trippy rhythmic states to unleashing sheer bass weight.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/____shli/\nhttps://echotrainer.bandcamp.com/.../ech009-bracing-set...",

The Aeronaut is currently still a work in progress; this evening offers keen punters a chance to watch Vorn and his frighteningly good band (Nick Brown - Drums; Charley Davenport - Bass, Thomas Liggett - Violin) iron out the final kinks on a future Kiwi classic.

We have secured the one and only COKI for an intimate warehouse rave at an inner city location.\nThis legend of bass needs no introduction, but we\u2019ll give him one anyway. As one half of DIGITAL MYSTIKZ, Coki has made sine waves move like no other, architecting much of the sonic blueprint that modern dubstep has become known for. Alongside Mala, he helped forge the DMZ sound and is now making his way to Wellington for a rare showcase of pure low-frequency warfare. Expect heavyweight pressure, bone-rattling subs, and that unmistakable Coki wobble - this is dubstep in its rawest form.\nOn support we have drawn for the best of the best.

    "description": "Wendyhouse / DSLB / vegetable.machine.animal, Wendyhouse are Bryce Galloway and Daniel Powell (AKA Mr Pudding and EE monk). The pair met at the Elam School of Fine Arts. Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995. Wendyhouse output has been somewhat sporadic ever since, but with EE monk\u2019s recent return, the pair have returned to performing live.\nWendyhouse music was initially played on toy musical instruments, the kind that fit inside a Wendy house. Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo. Guitar, toy keyboard and vocals are the Wendyhouse instruments of choice.\n---\n\nDSLB\nDSLB is the solo project of Chrissie Butler (the shouty bass playing half of the now sleeping duo, mr sterile Assembly). An offshoot from Chrissie's other band Ditzy Squall, DSLB (Ditzy Squall's Lunch Box) is a showcase for a love of long endings and the hum things make when you hold them close to your ear. Performed live, DSLB is an improvised mash-up of ancient record players, purring keyboards, kitchen utensils and found objects. Soundtracks for short films and hand drawn comics are also residents in the lunch box. Recordings are released by skirted Records.\nhttps://skirtedrecords.com/dslb/\n---\nvegetable.machine.animal\nNew solo project courtesy of Mr Sterile, in which living fungal and plantlife inform a modular synthesiser with biofeedback. This signal acts upon the synth changing the pitch, tone, rate and more in the delivery of sound. These \u2018curated\u2019 sounds are then responded to with percussion. VMA explores the intersections between spontaneous playing, electronic music, and science-informed inter-species collaboration.\nhttps://mrsterileassembly.bandcamp.com/.../my-daughter...\n",

Off the back of a monstrous summer, which saw them play 19 shows up and down the country, the pair have spent most of 2025 in the studio finessing their own brand of audio alchemy and preparing to release their label, also named XCOMMUNICATE.\nUsually XCOMMUNICATE is a 6 hour journey though decades and sonic realms, however as Heylady is still recovering from a mighty dose of burnout they\u2019ve roped in a couple of their good friends, who happen to be some of Wellington\u2019s finest, to join them as they lay down four hours of four to the floor. \nHalo is a mainstay on Wellington dancefloors and it was a no brainer asking her to be on this lineup. A DJ since 2000, she has played festivals across the country and never fails to rock her slot. Her set at Taniwha\u2019s Den last summer was a big highlight and one of the best of the festival. Halo\u2019s ability to drive forward thinking sound and her clever construction of sets are just two reasons you need to be on her floor.\nDJ Coda is the godfather of techno in New Zealand.

Be prepared to drop into a deep space.\nDoor sales will be available if there is space. Advanced booking is recommended.\n\nSika's Sound Journeys are truly unique. They are sonic explorations that feature didgeridoos, drums, flutes, voice and orchestral elements. A collection of foraged sounds from objects he has recorded in nature, add even more textures. Many of his sounds are completely unrecognisable and abstract. Immersed in this cocoon of abstract sound, we can find ourselves in the most surprising places in our mind. In this timeless realm, beyond the normal limitations of rational reality, anything is possible.\n\nAn epic adventure deep inside yourself.\n\nJourney to worlds within worlds on incredible sound waves.\n\nSika creates a safe space to relax deeply and connect with our inner guidance. This Sound Journey begins and ends with a short guided visualisation.\n\nThere will be two journeys with an interval. Most people choose to lie down, so once again, please bring a yoga mat, pillow and blanket to get really comfortable.\n\nA journal is also recommended.",

After being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition at the age of eleven that left him paralyzed from the waist down, Wes experienced a miraculous recovery for which the doctors themselves had no medical explanation.

He spent his high school years in Northern Ontario and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and three children.\nWesley is currently the Central Canada Director for Apologetics Canada and has been a guest on a variety of public platforms, from The Joe Rogan Experience and Piers Morgan Uncensored, to Apologia Radio and Daily Dose of Wisdom. He has participated in numerous public dialogues, debates, and interfaith events on issues of belief and religion globally.\nHe holds a BA in sociology from York University, a Masters of Theological Studies from Tyndale University, and is currently doing a PhD in New Testament at the University of Toronto\u2019s Wycliffe College.
