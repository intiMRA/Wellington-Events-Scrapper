The National War Memorial and FPC Martin Square are both undergoing major refurbishment - join us for a look behind the scenes!\nNational War Memorial: Refurbishing a Wellington Icon\nStep behind the scaffolding and witness the National War Memorial Project \u2013 a complex seismic strengthening project where heritage sensitivity is of utmost importance. With construction works being carried out by Maycroft Construction, join us for the rare opportunity to explore a significant piece of the capital\u2019s cultural fabric.\nKnown to many as the backdrop of ANZAC Day commemorations, this national memorial is undergoing a meticulous refurbishment to ensure its legacy endures for generations to come.\n What\u2019s Happening On Site:\nSeismic strengthening of the tower and bell frame \nStone remediation to preserve its historic fa\u00e7ade\nAsphalt roofing works\nThe real challenge? Balancing modern engineering with heritage preservation. Every upgrade is being carried out with deep respect for the building\u2019s historical significance.\n\nThen, just around the corner, we will move on to another refurbishment project \u2013 at a much different scale and for a very different purpose!\n FPC Martin Square: from Workshop to Office Space\nLeading industrial design-and-build specialists First Principles Constructors are celebrating seven years of innovation with a bold move - into a brand-new headquarters in central Wellington. Take a look inside the transformation of a former engineering workshop into the new HQ for FPC. With exposed services, raw materials, and an industrial aesthetic, this compact yet clever refurbishment shows how much can be achieved in a small urban footprint. Construction is well underway by Aoraki Construction, with completion coming up in September.\nWhat\u2019s Happening On Site:\n\u2022 \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002Structural steel installation, new roofing, cladding, a new concrete mezzanine slab\n\u2022 \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002Interior fit-out works\n\u2022 \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002Full building services upgrades\n The Details:\n\ud83d\udd52 DATE and TIME: Wednesday, 20th August, meet at 2.45pm for a 3.00pm start at the National War Memorial\n\ud83d\udccd LOCATION: Meet at the National War Memorial (19 Buckle Street) to explore this site first. We will then walk over to 21 Martin Square as a group, for the next site visit.\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f COST: Free to NAWIC members, with a maximum of 18 people on the tour, so please book your space consciously. Get in quick! You can join NAWIC here.\n\ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2640\ufe0fPPE: Hard hat, hi-vis, steel-capped boots. (Spare hard-hats/hi-vis are available if required, please make sure you advise us of what you need on your RSVP.)\n \ud83c\udf89 After the site visits, unwind with drinks and nibbles sponsored by First Principles Constructors at a nearby venue (TBC) \u2013 a chance to connect, reflect, and chat all things design and construction.\n\ud83e\udde1 Huge thanks to Studio of Pacific Architecture, Aoraki Construction, Maycroft Construction, and First Principles Constructors for teaming up to make this event possible.\nPlease note: NAWIC is a voluntary organisation, committed to its obligations as a PCBU under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.

    "description": "Social Animal, Created by Stephen Papps and Damon Andrews. Performed by Stephen Papps.\n\nYou can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks... can you? Biting satire and theatre wizardry fuse in a comically inventive roller-coaster about the fear of irrelevance and the healing power of an animal. Award-winning actor, writer, and solo performer, Stephen Papps, plays twelve characters with beguiling virtuosity, in this gloriously funny solo tour de force about a man who loses face in a desperate attempt to regain his relevance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive for a performer to embody a big range of characters ... well-written and full of humorous insights and revelations ... glorious!\u201d \u2013 Cate Prestige, Theatreview.\n\nAudience care: Recommended for audiences aged 13+",
