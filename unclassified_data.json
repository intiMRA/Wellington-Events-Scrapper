Last month was intense, and we love intensity, but felt the need to bring it down. The focus for this month is calm. Chill. Relaxation. This is truly going to be the most gentle Airhorn you have seen.\nThere will be no flashing lights or threat of epilepsy. There will not be loud noises or gross out humour. There will not be airhorns! This is not a bit. We are sincerely concerned that folks are going to come to think this is a goof and expect the usual madcap, abrasive chaos of our comedy show.\nThere will be no abrasion. There will be no chaos. We are wanting to do the most experimental show we can do, which in our case is a low-key, cozy, warm-hearted hour of quiet reflection and gentle comedy.This is going to be a soft show for everyone who needs a minute to just breathe. You will laugh, but not enough to hurt your side or upset your neighbor. It will be a laugh held in the liminal space between a deep breath and a long sigh.\nFor folks in which this amount of calm is too stressful, we will also have a Stimulation Booth (provided by Wattie's) available at any time to provide the classic Airhorn jolt they need.

He can't seem to find joy in anything these days, not even the donuts he used to take such pride in making by hand. Vandals armed with spray paint, predatory landlords, and that nefarious Starbucks down the road all threaten to unceremoniously snuff out the only thing he's got left.\nThat is, until an upstart, ambitious young man shoulders his way into becoming a Superior Donuts employee, and an unlikely friendship (or is it a rivalry?) develops, inspiring both to face the demons they've been hiding from all this time.\nThis is a sharp-witted, heartfelt comedy by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts (\u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d) offering a warm and wry take on depression, diversity, and bravery that will leave you feeling all fluffy and sugary on the inside. Plus, who knows, you might get a donut!\nGo to the Stagecraft website to book your spot!\nhttps://www.stagecraft.co.nz/auditions\nAUDITIONS:\nAuditions will be on Saturday 13th & Sunday 14th September, with callbacks the evening of Monday 15th September.\nTo book an audition, please fill out the form by 10th September - we'll be in touch to confirm your audition date, time and location.

[Has a scene involving some violence]\nFranco Wicks [Male, African-American, 20s]\nYoung, idealistic, a little pushy, and full of attitude and energy. Franco believes that good things will happen to him despite all odds, and evidence, to the contrary. A former employee of Luther.\nMax [Male, Russian, 40s - 60s]\nOwner of the DVD shop next door, Max is interested in buying Superior Donuts to expand his (tiny) capitalist empire. Fancies himself a self-made man. [Speaks in a Russian accent, along with some dialogue in Russian]\nRandy [Female, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nRaised in the middle of 7 brothers and working as a cop in the Chicago Police Department, Randy\u2019s always been \u2018one of the boys\u2019. Big hockey fan. Has a soft spot for Arthur.\nJames [Male, African-American, 30s - 40s]\nAnother cop with the Chicago Police Department and Randy\u2019s beat partner. Well-respected in the community and [not so] secretly a giant Star Trek nerd. [Will consider any and all BIPOC actors for this role]\nLady [Female, Irish-American, 60s - 70s]\nLikely homeless and definitely a little hard-of-hearing, Lady is a well-known as a confusing-but-likeable, perhaps even mascot-like figure in the Uptown community. Well past the point of giving a crap about what other people think.\nLuther [Male, Irish-American, 30s - 40s]\nLocal bookie and crime-syndicate everyman, Luther has scratched out his living taking money from gambling addicts, which he finds troubling because he\u2019d like to consider himself a good, fair man. Has a stomach ulcer which is probably somehow representative of this inner conflict. [Has a scene involving some violence]\nKevin [Male, Irish, 20s]\nAnother of Luther\u2019s employees, Kevin\u2019s probably fallen into the wrong crowd as a young man, but it doesn\u2019t seem to trouble him that much. Seems to care mostly about getting paid and drinking Coca-Cola.\nKiril [Male, Russian, 20s - 30s]\nA shy man of few words (mostly \u2018hello\u2019), Kiril is an intimidating figure with a big soft heart beating beneath his tall muscular frame. Brought into the fold to be a construction worker and bodyguard, he\u2019s mostly interested in falling in love with the local bartender. [Most dialogue is in Russian] ",

These are lives shaped by love and politics, motherhood and memory, constraint and defiance.\nFrom girls raised in the garden of Plunket founder Truby King, to a queer university student at a mid-2000s Berlin rave, to a mother facing the cost of her son\u2019s climate rebellion, the women of All Her Lives are complex, resilient and deeply human. Shadowing their stories is the early feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, whose journey of grief and revolution will become a vessel for what endures \u2013 and for finding hope.\nVast and intimate, All Her Lives explores the layered selfhood of women \u2013 all that they inherit, sacrifice, imagine and carry forward \u2013 and the power found in unravelling and reweaving those selves on their own terms.\n'A wonderful collection that swims in and out of women's lives across time, exploring the struggle for freedom and love.

Peter is reluctant to stay with nanna in the school holidays because she lives in the country and doesn't have a TV but Nanna finds ways to engage Peter in her love of the forest, especially the precious manu, when they build a nesting box for Ruru together. Peter is excited to see if Ruru will make her home in the box, waiting patiently while many other birds arrive to check out the box first! And after all that waiting, Nanna takes Peter on an exciting night time forest walk to find Ruru - in the dark! The bird characters are all familiar New Zealand locals, such as piwakawaka, kereru, tui and ruru, and the story highlights the importance of supporting them and the different needs they may have. Teachers and Parents have been ecstatic about this show and hundreds of New Zealand children have been transfixed by it.\nAs quoted by Theatreview: \u201cThis is truly a New Zealand show for New Zealand children and all those young-at-heart\u201d.",

    "description": "Heathers the Musical, It\u2019s Westerberg High, where popularity is a matter of life and death. Welcome to \u2018Heathers the Musical\u201d. Based on a movie with the same name, the show is a coming-of-age story dealing with love, heartache, defying expectations, and being true to yourself. It originally premiered in Los Angeles in 2013. Since then, the musical has had record-breaking seasons across the globe. It now makes its professional New Zealand debut in 2026, and Wellington is in line to join the school assembly. Described as a high-octane, black comedy rock musical, Heathers is packed with a mix of ballads and showstoppers. The catchy tunes are written by Kevin Murphy (Desperate Housewives) and Laurence O\u2019Keefe (Legally Blonde: The Musical). \nThe 1989 film starred Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. It quickly achieved cult status among audiences. Both the movie and musical follow high school student Veronica Sawyer. Veronica is just another nobody until she\u2019s unexpectedly taken under the wings of the beautiful and cruel Heathers. When mysterious teen rebel J.D. arrives, Veronica learns that it might kill to be a nobody, but it's murder being a somebody. \nThis special production will feature a stellar Australasian cast. So grab your scrunchies, break out the Corn Nuts and wait for the bell to ring.",

A lot has happened to Wayne over the last 10 years. He has retired, his son has moved to London with his grandchildren and Maggie, his wife of 49 years, passed away suddenly a year ago. For Wayne, his family and his work were his life. They were the source of his life's pleasure and purpose and now he is having to cope with the loss of both.\n\nThe only thing left to take his mind off the pain is cycling with his MAMIL friends, especially Bryan, the central character of MAMIL. But a panic attack mid-ride and a crash with catastrophic consequences leads to a crisis of cycling confidence and the inability to do the thing he loves the most.\n\nLike MAMIL, it takes an array of characters to help the central character rediscover what is truly important when their life seems adrift and meaningless. A relentlessly positive Scottish counsellor, a philosophical Romanian personal trainer, Wayne\u2019s new arch-enemy in the form of an ocker Ozzie retirement village owner who grinds his gears and yes, even Pinarello -- the Italian bike of Bryan\u2019s and Wayne\u2019s nightmares -- all wittingly and unwittingly help Wayne get back on the bike and realise he still has something to offer, he still has a purpose and most importantly a reason to get out of bed every morning aside from going for a piss.\n\n\u201cAn engaging and earnest work of art, packed with",

Following the phenomenal popularity of MAMIL (Middle Aged Man in Lycra), which played to over 70,000 people across the country, comes its laugh-out-loud sequel: GOMIL \u2013 Grumpy Old Man in Lycra. And this time, it's going national.\n\nFrom the comedic genius of writer and director Gregory Cooper (MAMIL, That Bloody Woman) and starring Kiwi acting royalty Mark Hadlow ONZM (King Kong, The Hobbit, SNAG), GOMIL is primed to bring a fresh wave of laughter, Lycra, and life\u2019s mid-life absurdities to 14 cities throughout New Zealand in a major national tour kicking off this September.\n\nAfter a critically acclaimed, sold-out debut season in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, GOMIL is shifting gears and going full speed ahead across Aotearoa. Audiences who laughed (and winced) along with the unforgettable antics in MAMIL will now follow the journey of our favourite cyclist as he faces a new life stage: grumpier, greyer, and still clad in way too much Lycra.\n\nHadlow, one of the country\u2019s most beloved performers, reprises his role with impeccable comic timing and emotional depth, bringing to life a story that\u2019s not only hilarious, but also touching, timely, and unashamedly relatable.\n\nWhether you're a weekend warrior, a reluctant spouse, or just someone who enjoys watching others sweat the small (and stretchy) stuff, GOMIL is a must-see. This show digs deep into the world of ageing men, fragile egos, friendship, family, and the undeniable need to keep moving\u2014no matter how creaky your knees may be.\n\nGet ready to laugh, reflect, and maybe even wince in recognition as GOMIL pedals its way across the country this spring. It\u2019s more than a show\u2014it\u2019s a celebration of growing older (and slightly wider) with humour, heart, and a healthy dose of spandex.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next chapter in this iconic Kiwi comedy saga. GOMIL is coming to a theatre near you - lycra, laughter and all.\n\n--\nFor accessibility seating information and wheelchair space bookings please email kiaora@teraukura.nz or call 04)9740535 during office hours.",

    "description": "Opening - Slipping through your fingers, grasping, Meanwhile invites you to the opening of \u2018Slipping through your fingers, grasping\u2019 by Justine Fletcher, Christine Brimer andRita Takeuchi\n_____\nThe text Sounding the Event, by artist and writer Yve Lomax, raises the question \u201cWhat does it mean to grasp something by letting it slip through your fingers?\u201d\nSlipping Through Your Fingers, Grasping explores the paradoxical ways in which everyday experiences can be apprehended\u2014through their fluid, malleable qualities rather than rigid, unyielding structures. The installation brings together the practices of Justine Fletcher, Christine Brimer, and Rita Takeuchi to draw attention to the fleeting essence of daily life, the interplay of absence and presence, and the ever-changing nature of time and memory.\nExperience is always slipping away; time, memory, or an event can only be grasped in their passing, in their trace, or in their absence. Short, intermittent chimes highlight this ephemerality, making duration palpable through moments of presence and absence. Paintings emerge from an attunement to everyday encounters and their emotional resonance, while sculptural and woven forms unravel and shift, emphasising process not as a means to an end, but as a state of becoming. Together, the works suggest that sometimes the only way to \u201chold\u201d something, whether a moment, time, or an atmosphere, is by revealing its impermanence.\n",

Countless emotional potholes\nAlong the way, we get a rare look into the gritty, heartfelt, and often-overlooked life of one of Aotearoa\u2019s essential workers \u2014 the truck driver\nIs the open road calling \u2014 or is the stage his true destination?\nBuckle up. This is verbatim theatre with serious mileage.\nCreated and Performed by Jackson Burling\nDirected by Simon Leary | Produced by Tom Smith ",

What follows is an improvised journey of chaos, corporate jargon, and an earnest attempt to prove they\u2019re more than just the diversity checkbox.\nFrom the chaotic minds of Wellington improv duo Mo and Ralph, D.E.I.\u2019s is a sharp, satirical, improvised workplace comedy about tokenism, identity, and the conundrums of modern day allyship. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what happens when the diversity quota starts talking back \u2014 this is it.\nAs the Sohn Zone is improvised, we cannot guarantee the presence or absence of specific content or themes beyond what is in the description above. The show may contain mature themes and language, but not gratuitously. D.E.I.'s contains strong language and adult themes, and discussions of topics like racism, queerness, and tokenism. Some material may touch on lived experiences of marginalisation and may be confronting for some audience members.\nBoth shows may contain voluntary audience interaction, such as giving a suggestion for a scene.\n",

These talks are held in the National Library in Wellington and on Zoom. Some of these talks will be repeated in Auckland. The public programme highlights the work of researchers who draw on Turnbull material for their projects and staff who care for and research the collections.\nAbout the speaker\nNick Bevin practised as an architect from 1984 to 2024 and was made a Distinguished Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Architects in 2022.\nIn 2006, Nick first became involved with the Futuna Chapel Trust. He was drawn in by an early childhood memory, triggered by a black and white image of the opening of the Chapel on 19 March 1961, where he remembered accompanying his parents to the opening of the chapel. Since then he has developed a growing admiration for the chapel\u2019s architect John Scott, and was involved in the gifting process of the John Scott Drawing Archive to the Alexander Turnbull library in 2020.\nNick chaired the Chapel Trust from 2009 to 2024 and remains a trustee. With fellow trustee Greg O\u2019Brien, Nick co-edited the book Futuna \u2013 Life of a Building published in 2016. In 2024, Nick participated in the organisation of an exhibition at Futuna Chapel that included a number of John Scott\u2019s drawings from the Turnbull Collection.",

It's not just another course; it's a transformative experience that will empower you to become a more confident and persuasive speaker\" Alex Goryachev, New Zealand Green Building Council\n\u201cThis course not only met my expectations, but it completely exceeded them. This has been one of the most transformative courses I\u2019ve attended. Jane totally revolutionised the way I now approach presentations. Having felt fear in the past each time I have to present to large groups, for the first time I now feel like I have the tools, understanding and ability to approach presentations and conquer my fear. I can\u2019t thank Jane enough.\u201d Nadia Marsh, Head of Bids, Tonkin & Taylor\n\"I have never been in such a well-run course (I've done a lot) Jane was amazing she held our attention from start to finish each day. I feel we all learnt so much and I will definitely be taking her advice on how I can improve myself. This course was well above what I expected, Jane had a great way of communicating. Typically, people tune out or lose interest by the end of the day. This was not the case for us. I honestly thing it\u2019s the best course I\u2019ve been on in my 4 years with WCC.\" Joshua Harding, Team Leader Consents, Wellington City Council\n\n\u201cThe course is awesome. The balance between talk time, practical learning and feedback is perfect. The trainer really made the course for me - she is sensitive and responsive to people\u2019s needs and is genuine in her approach to give the learners as much out of the time as possible.

It is designed for advanced students and focuses on teaching a range of claw setting techniques, along with straightforward construction methods to securely hold gemstones of various shapes and sizes. The emphasis is on mastering the techniques rather than creating polished, finished jewellery pieces.\nStudents are encouraged to bring along their own particular tools, metal and stones if they would like to. They can also bring their own half made ring shanks or other projects to set into.\nThey will start by creating claw settings for flat-bottomed stones on plate to gain an understanding of how claws work.\nStudents will then move on to faceted stones and be shown how to construct their own settings in a number of styles, and how to secure their stones in settings. Finally, they will be taught the dos and don\u2019ts of finishing settings to a salable level.\nThe workshop will also look at how to use pre-made claw settings to best advantage.\nWorkshop fee $245, Early bird $221 till 27 July.

Both these structural approaches contribute greatly to the success of your drawing.\n\nGeometric shapes can simplify a subject, unify a drawing and make compositions dynamic. Geometric solids will help render any subject in three dimensions and transition to perspective.\n\nA good working knowledge of the concepts of perspective will help you draw any subject with correct dimensionality. It can also help in your realist drawing, painting and invented subjects and environments. These concepts are also used in most two dimensional art because it enables us to realise great spatial effects, making it an invaluable tool to add to your skill set.\n\n8 x weekly morning or afternoon sessions.

She takes inspiration from all the wonderful artists she encounters in the real world and online. She noticed that this particular type of fluid art hadn't really been done the way she does it, so she has developed her own unique style utilising blacklight reactive and glow-in-the-dark paints. Let her colour your world and explore the possibilities of fluid art together.",

    "description": "Jewellery-making in 4 weeks - Saturday Mornings, Level 2+, This class is for students at level 2 or higher and is not open to beginners. This advanced class is ideal for those who are already competent at soldering simple joins, annealing, and basic tool use on their own. Students must have completed a minimum of two 4-week blocks or one 6-week block. If you are unsure of your level, please contact us for advice.\n\nAn advanced set of students means that your tutor can support you to take on more exciting and complex challenges. They will work with the group to find appropriate projects. Each 4-week block may focus on a particular skill topic, rather than covering many different topics for each student.\n\nLevel 2 students will learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project to hone their skills. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet, or a more complex bezel setting.\n\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple, self-directed projects to work on in class.\n\nPlease note that this class fee does not include materials. All metals and stones, as well as quality findings and chains, are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it in future projects. If you need to arrange an alternative payment plan, please contact us.",

    "description": "Jewellery-making in 8 weeks - Tuesday Eve Mixed Level, This class is mixed level, allowing beginners to work alongside advanced students. It starts on Tuesday, 14 October and runs for 8 weeks till Tuesday, 2 December, 5.30pm - 8pm.\nOur popular weeknight classes are the best way for beginners to get into jewellery making in a lively, warm and friendly environment.\nBeginners start with basic ring-making and stone-setting in copper or brass. Students will learn measuring, texturing, shaping, cutting and soldering. Then we move on to making a practice-ring set with a Cabochon stone (cabochon means it has a flat bottom and a smooth domed top) in a Bezel Setting. The stone-setting process teaches you many fundamental techniques in one project! As you work through your practice-ring and setting, you can move onto working in silver and produce another ring with a cabachon stone that you really love. This way you will learn the basics as you go on your practice-ring, before taking the next step in costly silver.\nLevel 2 students learn to solder more competently on their own using chainmaking as a way to develop their fine soldering skills. They may create a simple stone setting or ring alongside this challenge project so they have something to hone their skills that they are familiar with, as well as taking on a new skill. Their silver project could be a pendant on a handmade chain, a charm bracelet or a more complex bezel setting - for example a teardrop or soft square stone to take on bezels with corners!\nLevel 3 and above students are encouraged to work on their design skills and try new and challenging techniques. They should prepare to have one or two simple projects they can work on self-directed in class: more chains or simple bezel settings are ideal - to help them strengthen their soldering skills - alongside a challenge project that might be a shelf setting (an adaptation of a bezel setting that can take faceted stones), a tube setting or a larger bezel setting for a box or brooch. Our tutors will work with you to discover your passions in the world of making, and to support your skills so you grow your understanding with each block you take. We recommend that students from level 3 and up take the occasional Technique class (for example - claw setting, enamelling, flush setting) and then bring those techniques into their projects in their block class to be supported in their practice and skill by their regular tutor.\nThis class fee does NOT include materials for any student.\nBeginners should expect to spend at least $60 on materials for their ring making project.\nAll metals and stones as well as quality findings and chains are available for purchase each week in the studio. Students are encouraged to keep their silver scrap and find ways to use it thriftily in future projects!\nCourse fee $395, Early bird $355 till 21 September.\nOur booking system asks for payment to be made via credit card, Afterpay or PayPal on booking.

Krav Maga has proven to be highly empowering for women all around the world. We offer this course to women to learn to deal with women-related challenges, encouraging every woman to overcome anxiety or fear, with confidence, skills, strength.\nIn an ideal world, women would not need to learn to protect themselves. However, until some deeply ingrained societal problems are resolved, it is smart and necessary to have some skills to be able to look after yourself and loved ones with. In the meantime, we encourage every women to approach this training with personal development, personal growth, enjoyment and empowerment being the motivating purpose.\nWe understand women often prefer to train in a women's class. This is our Women's (13+) class called ROAR.\nBeginning in 2018, this program was created to provide a safe, holistic and supportive class where women can experience empowerment through training. You will learn to find your voice, inner strength and resolve, while learning physical skills such as how to escape and overpower an assailant, counter grabs, abduction attempts, chokes, hair grabs, pushing and shoving, being hit, being pinned to the ground and sexual assault attempts. We will help you unleash your protective feminine fighting spirit.\nThe Intro Night is the ideal time for women interested in the Women's Class to try a class first, see how we train, who we are, and gain some valuable basic skills, before deciding to join the full course. (Note: School Term 4, 2025 is 11 weeks long). No cost to attend the Intro Night.\nPlease email contact@tacticalsurvival.co.nz to enquire or book your spot.\nMore Info: www.tacticalsurvival.co.nz/womens\nAfter Intro, classes run every Wednesday night 7:00pm - 8:00pm (Thistle Hall Cuba St) ",

The fund supports NGO's and UN partner organisations on the frontline of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza - more information here https://crisisrelief.un.org/en/\n\nIt's an opportunity to give back and to share kai, and spend time with community. We have immense privilege in Aotearoa, and cooking and sharing food is a way that feels important (to me - Nicole) as a way to bring people together for a good cause, in the face of what often feels like endless global and local injustice, oppression and catastrophe.\n\nAll ticket sales from this fundraiser will go to the OPT Fund, to support the people most in need when they need it.\n\nIncluded in the ticket sales are:\n-a three course family style meal (menu released closer to the date, vegetarian and vegan option)\n-tunes from some of Wellington's local musicians\n-discounted beverages on the bar (with sales going directly to the Fund)\n\nInvite your friends! Bring your colleagues!\nTickets here: https://events.humanitix.com/an-evening-for-palestine\n\nDoors open 5:30, music from 6, dinner from 7.\n\nWe're currently sourcing donations from local sponsors to make the event possible.

The Crop Swap team will distribute any koha crop and left over crops to local food pantries.\n2.

    "description": "Dia de los Muertos - Day of the Dead Celebration with Claudio Escutia, Dia de los Muertos - Day of the Dead Celebration with Claudio Escutia\nJoin Claudio for this special occasion we will be celebrating one of the most important holidays in Mexico, the day of the dead or \u201cDia de los Muertos\u201d.\n\nThe Day of the Dead is one of the traditions that has remained alive throughout the centuries; the main holidays are November 1 & 2, which UNESCO designated and cataloged as an Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2003.\n\nThis special celebration dates back to prehispanic times before the arrival of Europeans to America, and has been alive and widely celebrated over the years.\n\nAbout the Day of the Dead\nThe Day of the Dead tradition dates back to pre-Hispanic times, when a tribute was paid to death; the tribute took place from the last week of October to the first days of November.\n\nPrehispanic Mexicans conceived Death as the beginning of the journey to Mictl\u00e1n (the Place of the Dead), during which the soul of the deceased had to overcome various obstacles before reaching Mictlantecuhtli (the Lord of the Dead) and Mictecac\u00edhuatl (the Lady of the Dead). Upon reaching the gods of Mictl\u00e1n, an offering had to be made to them in order to obtain eternal rest.\n\nWhat to Expect\nClaudio will explain why it is important to celebrate and take the time to honour and remember the members of your family, ancestors and loved ones who have passed away. He will also explain the mysticism and spirituality around the Day of the Dead celebration.\n\nWe\u2019ll also learn how to set up your ofrenda, or altar, and which elements are important for it (as well their meaning).\n\nIt's very common for an ofrenda of the dead to be placed inside Mexican homes, decorated with papel picado, food, traditional sweets, and photos of loved ones. Candles and marigold flowers are also placed as a sign of welcome for our loved ones.\n\nFeel free to bring photos of your beloved ones that have passed away, fruits and flowers for the altar and anything that your beloved ones valued / loved when they were here with us. We will place those on the altar.\n\nThe Evening\u2019s Schedule\nCleansing copal and herbal welcoming.\n\nAn opening ceremony to acknowledge the Tlalmanalli (offering and altar) with the deep sound of the conch shell in the four directions and drums sounds.\n\nHistory of the day of the dead celebration.\n\nExplanation of the altar, and the main elements for an ofrenda.\n\nStorytelling: learn of Mexican legends like Catrinas and Xoloitzcuintle (the Mexican dog that helps the dead to find their way to Mictlan, the Aztec underword).\n\nRemembering and sharing histories about the loved ones that passed away (optional but encouraged)\n\nTraditional Mexican chants for remembering the loved ones\n\nAtole de Chocolate, a traditional prehispanic drink - amazing in flavour, consumed cold or hot\n\nMusic to invoke emotion and imagery of contemplative natural and mystical environments\n\nFinish with a shamanic atmosphere of relaxation and traditional chants.\n\nDetails\nWhen: Saturday 1 November, 7pm -9pm\n\nWhere: AWHI Yoga & Wellbeing - Level 2, 15 Johnston Street, Wellington CBD.\n\nInvestment: $55 (first 5 enrolments - $45!); Children under 16 years old - $35\n\nHaere Mai!\nEveryone is welcome including kids (see special pricing).

The recent cold months enraging Miro's spirit, he has returned to the light to present his new thinking. The ordinance is about stopping the nullifying wishwash, and getting everyone back to listening to each other! We will swing, dance, we will blow that's sure. There is a tendency for fiction in art that goes often ignored here, but not today! It will be bold and hopefully we will all (you included) be talking to each other, before, after, and during the gig. I think everyone in the band has lots to say and it would be a bummer if you missed out. Come!\n\nMusicians: Miro Holland, Evie Patterson, Ateo Buhne, Nico Buhne and Isaac Randel.",

Richie and his friends play the slowest, sleaziest, spookiest, sweetest, swinginest old records they can find, and people dance real slow in a haze of smoke and dim red light. It's a good time.\n\nIn the last few years Richie has taken Slow Grind Fever on the road, with regular dances in Sydney, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs. They post up a monthly Slow Grind Fever mix in the week before the party every month, and have collaborated with Stag-O Lee Records in Germany on a series of Slow Grind Fever LPs and CDs.\n\nEnjoy the music and if you feel so inclined, get down to Slow Grind Fever - Wellington at Meow on Friday 17th October.\n\nListening to the MP3 mixes is nice, but when you\u2019re in the room all\nwrapped up in smoke with the music sizzling right off the old records, through the speakers and into your brain, well, there's nothing quite like it\u2026\n\nhttp://www.slowgrindfever.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/slowgrindfeverclub\n\n",

After revealing that one of her life goals is to have her portrait painted by Lucian Freud, the enigmatic artist invites Moss to his studio.\n\nInfamously private and fiercely guarded, Freud begins to unravel Moss\u2019 hidden depths, and as the two British cultural icons converge, a lasting bond is formed.\n\nAs their mesmerising rapport develops, Kate discovers her true self, and Freud finds his eternal muse.\n\nBamber and Jacobi wonderfully portray these iconic figures, enabling audiences to witness the personal interaction that took place behind closed doors.\n\nThis impressive feature debut from Oscar-winning New Zealand writer/director James Lucas (the film is a UK/NZ co-production) is a tender portrait of self-reflection and an unexpectedly transformative friendship.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the gorgeous visuals, elegant writing and captivating performances of Moss & Freud!\nDirector\nJames Lucas\nCast\nEllie Bamber, Derek Jacobi",

English journalist Ian Bailey was investigated by Irish authorities, but never faced trial in Ireland - despite the fact he was tried and convicted in absentia by the French government.\n\nRe-Creation directors Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot, In the Name of the Father) and David Merriman have constructed a fascinating mix of fiction and reality that explores the question: what if Bailey had been tried in Ireland?\n\nThe film skilfully brings audiences into the room as a fictional jury sorts through the facts, inconsistencies and inconvenient truths that make the case so intriguing to this day.\n\nWith spectacular performances from the ensemble cast, headed by the remarkable Vicky Krieps (Phantom Thread), Re-Creation is an unmissable entry in this year\u2019s line-up.\nRating\nOffensive language & content that may disturb\nDirector\nJim Sheridan and David Merriman\nCast\nVicky Krieps, Jim Sheridan, Aidan Gillen, Colm Meaney",

Following the West Highland Way and The Cape Wrath Trail, they spend 30 days together in nature - hoping to rekindle their once-powerful friendship.\n\nBut while Chris remains preoccupied with work and life back at home, Lluis is determined to finish the trail to prove he can do it. The solitude and silence of the Highlands forces them to confront harsh truths about themselves, their friendship, and what it truly means to stand still and listen.\n\nSet against the pace and demands of long-distance hiking, The North depicts the intricacies and challenges of both friendship and internal human struggles against the backdrop of the beautifully stark landscapes of the Highlands.\n\nDirector Bart Schrijver was inspired to make the film after walking New Zealand\u2019s own Te Araroa hike.\nRating\nOffensive language\nDirector\nBart Schrijver\nCast\nBart Harder, Carles Pulido",

When Hayung, the patriarch of an Atayal family, and the senior knowledge-keeper, dies, his oldest son Payang decides to run for election as head of the local district. The film Gaga follows this election, in its raw democratic, and occasionally corrupt, form and the ways \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes hilarious \u2013 that it affects the extended family. A groundbreaking film, Gaga is mostly in Atayal language and presents the life and social interactions of these contemporary indigenous Taiwanese people unsentimentally, with humour, with compassion, and with the sharp eye of a brilliant film-maker.\nGaga won Best Director and Best Supporting Actress at the 59th Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2022. Beyond Taiwan, it won the Best Director at the 2022 Singapore International Film Festival - Asian Feature Competition and has been screened at film festivals in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Auckland and New York.\nQ&A with Film Director Laha Mebow\nWe are delighted that Film Director Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first indigenous female director, will be attending the screening and take part in Q&A afterwards.\nLaha Mebow is the first female director from Taiwan to win Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards, the most prestigious film award in the Chinese-speaking world. An Indigenous filmmaker of the Tayal people, she is also the first Indigenous woman in Taiwan to direct a narrative feature. Her films explore spiritual inheritance, family trauma, and Indigenous identity through a deeply personal yet cinematic lens.\nShe has directed three feature films. Finding Sayun (2011) reimagines a colonial-era legend from an Indigenous perspective. Lokah Laqi! (2016), a coming-of-age tale of three Indigenous boys, was selected as Taiwan\u2019s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Her third feature, Gaga (2022), won Best Film at the Singapore International Film Festival and delves into generational shifts and cultural survival within an Indigenous family.\nLaha\u2019s body of work continues to break new ground for Indigenous representation in Asian cinema. Her unique voice bridges traditional storytelling and contemporary filmmaking, making her one of the most important and anticipated directors from Taiwan today.",

    "description": "2025 Taiwan Update Lectures, 2025 Taiwan Update Lectures\nJoin us for three talks by experts on different aspects of Taiwan\n\nAbout this Event\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nProfessor Chyungly Lee\nA stable and reliable energy supply is essential for a nation\u2019s economic growth and development. In selecting fuel sources, nowadays almost all countries have taken climate change into account, adopted sensible clean energy transition plans, and designed a schedule to meet the goal of Net Zero. While pursuing a 3-E (energy-economic-environmental) balanced energy supply strategy, Taiwan, lacking indigenous resources, faces unique challenges of supply disruptions from over dependence on energy imports and possible blockade, quarantine, or invasion from Beijing. Any disruption of power supply or surge of energy costs could not only threaten Taiwan\u2019s competitive edge in the global high-tech market but also undermine Taiwan\u2019s internal stability and the nation\u2019s survival. In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\n\n\nWhat does Taiwan\u2019s two-level politics tell us?\nProfessor Alex Tan\nThis presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century. Arguing that Taiwan serves as a \u201ccanary in the coalmine,\u201d the analysis highlights how the island\u2019s early and persistent political polarization\u2014rooted in identity politics and the legacies of authoritarian rule\u2014prefigures trends now visible in established democracies worldwide. The research explores how deep divisions between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reinforced by institutional and social factors, have led to legislative gridlock, declining trust in political institutions, and a \u201cdemocratic ceiling\u201d that constrains further democratic development. Taiwan\u2019s precarious geopolitical position, facing constant pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China, intensifies the dilemma of balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties. The presentation analyzes Taiwan\u2019s innovative responses to disinformation, foreign interference, and public health crises, illustrating both the resilience and fragility of democratic systems under external and internal stress.\n\n\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nAssociate Professor Chia-rong Wu\nThis research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games. Far from mere entertainment, these games draw on tribal traditions, ancestral stories, and deep connections to the land to create meaningful digital experiences. By blending oral storytelling with interactive gameplay, Taiwanese Indigenous game developers are preserving cultural memory while challenging colonial legacies. Titles like Princess Baleng, Tayal, VuVu, and Gadvia show how games can empower communities and pass down wisdom to younger generations in innovative and engaging ways. Gamers not only play a game but also immerse themselves in digital environments shaped by Indigenous perspectives and values. This study encourages all engaged audiences, including educators and students, to consider video games as powerful tools for cultural resurgence and learning. Focusing on Indigenous Taiwan, it highlights how digital games integrate historical consciousness and interactivity to reimagine the past and future of the island.\n\n\nAgenda\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 01:00 PM - 02:00 PM\nTaiwan\u2019s Multidimensional Energy Security Challenges\nInfo: In this talk, Dr. Chyungly Lee will first present fact sheets on Taiwan\u2019s energy status, summarize Taiwan\u2019s current energy strategy, and then discuss dilemmas and vulnerabilities that Taiwan might face in the next few years.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:00 PM - 02:15 PM\nCoffee Break\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 02:15 PM - 03:15 PM\nWhat does Taiwan's two-level politics tell us?\nInfo: This presentation examines Taiwan as a critical case study for understanding the evolving challenges to democracy in the 21st century.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:15 PM - 03:45 PM\nAfternoon Tea\nInfo: Please join us outside AM103 for some light refreshments\n\n\n\ud83d\udd51: 03:45 PM - 04:45 PM\nGaming Taiwan: Indigenous Epistemologies in Play\nInfo: This talk explores how Indigenous knowledge systems in Taiwan are being revitalized through video games.

    "description": "Taiwan\u2019s Economic Statecraft and the future of Liberal International Order, Abstract\nOver the last decade, China has punished countries that undermine its territorial claims and foreign policy goals with measures such as restricting trade, encouraging popular boycotts, and cutting off tourism. These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Australia. This talk focuses on Taiwan\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic sanctions, highlighting the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power.\nThe second part of this presentation will propose a common understanding of the liberal international order in which state and non-state actors follow rules, norms, and legal procedures in conducting international affairs. This rule-based practice is an essential part of the Asian regional order. If Taiwan were integrated into the multilateral institutions in Asia, the chance of conflict would be greatly reduced. The future of Taiwan also depends on the resilience of the liberal international order and other middle-power states in the Asia Pacific.\nBio\nChristina Lai is an Associate Research Fellow in the Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Dr. Lai received her Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown University. In 2015-2016, she was a post-doctoral fellow in China and the World Program at Princeton University. She is interested in U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, Chinese Foreign Policy, East Asian politics, and Qualitative Research Methods.

One person shares, the other simply listens. No interruptions. No fixing. No judgment. Just the rare experience of being fully seen and fully heard.\n\nThe twist? You\u2019ll be blindfolded.\nBy closing our eyes to the outer world, we drop our guards and tune into something deeper. This creates space for vulnerability, openness, and raw connection that we don\u2019t often experience in daily life.\n\nExpect an evening that\u2019s real, grounding, and surprisingly freeing \u2014 a chance to connect with yourself and with others in ways that go beyond sight.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to bring a partner or a friend \u2014 in fact, coming on your own is part of the experience. Everyone will be paired up on the night, so it\u2019s all about connecting beyond familiar circles.\n\nAfterwards, we\u2019ll share reflections over a nourishing plant-based dinner, keeping the conversation alive in a relaxed space.\n\nMeet Andre, your host\nAndre has been exploring the art of authentic connection since his teens, when a rite of passage in Golden Bay first sparked his passion for circle work. Since then, he has been creating spaces that invite honesty, vulnerability, and depth \u2014 guiding people into experiences of being truly seen and heard. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and breathwork facilitator, Andre brings creativity and presence to all his offerings, inspired by the question of what it really means to be human.",

We'll open with mindfully drinking \"Cacao Ambassador\" Cacao to bring awareness to our hearts & bodies.\n\nThe Movement - Easy to follow choreography with modifications.

My love is supporting people to feel good in their bodies and to remember that health can be both deeply healing and beautifully simple.\n\n\nAbout Kae-Lynn\nHello I\u2019m Kae-Lynn!\n\nI lead The Movement because, I believe everyone deserves a non judgmental space to catch their breath and, be reminded of their spark.\n\nWhen Mel first shared The Movement with me I was so I was burnt out, numb, and deeply disconnected. I was busy trying to love and please everyone else that I completely lost myself.\n\nDuring my first class something shifted. The music \u2014 the movements \u2014 Reminded me of that spark within me. It felt like my soul finally had permission to shine again. For that one hour, I could breathe. No pressure, no expectations, no noise from the world or my mind. Just movement, music, and freedom to be me.\n\nI believe fitness should be intentional, empowering and fun.\n\nCome give it a go!\n\n",

(Burst blood vessels in the brain).\n-Blood thinning medication. (Unfortunately, the blood thinners used to prevent such blood clots can increase the risk of bleeding in the brain, a cause of hemorrhagic stroke).\n-Pregnancy or possible pregnancy\n-Asthma\n-Mental Contraindications\n-Substance dependence & addiction (Deep breathwork journeys are not always appropriate for those who are still addicted to a substance, as it tends to raise suppressed or repressed material for processing. However, if you\u2019re currently in recovery, this can be extremely healing, and help you discover the deeper patterns that gave rise to this addiction. (Grof, 1985: 267 \u2013 268).\n-Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or psychosis\n-Hospitalisation for emotional crises in the last 10 years\n-Psychological conditions and diagnoses, which preclude safe emotional release.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the above, please inform Sarah.\n\n*Tickets are non-refundable, but are transferrable with 24 hours notice required.\n\n",

He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\n\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives.

So invite your friend/s and come along! This workshop is being held in Wellington so for those living outside the region, why not make it a weekend away to learn, explore new ideas, fresh inspiration and make lasting connections \ufffd\nLink to sign up below. Be quick as the venue has limited spaces!\n[https://forms.gle/Rm42pgFLCadBZFVQ7](https://forms.gle/Rm42pgFLCadBZFVQ7)\nWe probably don't say this enough - but we truly believe our work as ECE educators matters. It matters because the formative years of a child is very important- it influences their mental and emotional wellbeing. What you do as ECE educators shape our next generation and our future society.\nSo.. in a way, this is our way of expressing our gratitude and saying thank you for all that you do. We'd love to see you there! \ufffd ",

Whether you are single or partnered, whether your past experiences were harmonious or painful, each relationship reflects the inner dance of the masculine and feminine within us.\n\nThroughout history, these sacred energies\u2014Yin and Yang\u2014were meant to complement and support each other. Yet, distortions, suppression, and separation have created wounds that echo through generations. Many of us carry beliefs such as:\n\nMen cannot be trusted.\nWomen are not safe.\nLove must be earned.\n......\n\nRarely do we pause to sit with these wounds and meet the unhealed parts of our inner feminine and masculine. These energies may hold not only personal pain but also ancestral imprints passed down through time\u2014shaping the way we experience love and connection today.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f In this mini workshop, you will be guided through a shamanic journey to explore and heal your inner archetypes. Together, we will:\n\n\u2728 Release old wounds and limiting patterns carried by the inner feminine or masculine.\n\u2728 Make peace with the shadow side of our psyche.\n\u2728 Embody the wholeness of the Divine Masculine and Feminine within.\n\nWe will close our circle with a sacred forgiveness ritual, bridging the separation and returning to a state of balance, wholeness, and love.\n\nThis journey is open to everyone\u2014whether you are new to shamanic work or have walked this path before. All that is required is an open heart and willingness to connect deeply within.\n\n\ud83c\udf38 You\u2019ll leave with:\n\nA renewed sense of love and harmony within yourself.\nGreater balance between your inner masculine and feminine.\nA deeper connection to spirit, self, and the essence of oneness.\n\nEvent Details\n\ud83d\udcc5 Saturday, September 27th\n\ud83d\udd52 3:00\u20136:00 pm\n\ud83d\udccd Lotus Yoga Centre \u2013 Sanctuary, Paraparaumu\n\ud83d\udcab Energy Exchange: $55 per person\n\ud83c\udf3f Limited to 12 participants\n\n\u2728What to bring:\nA water bottle, journal, cushion or blanket for comfort.\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Rides from Wellington may be arranged\u2014please contact me if needed.Contact: 0272541272\n\nAbout Your Guide - Fery Qiu\n\nI am a Shamanic Healer who is committed to the healing path that help people heal from the core of their being. From suicidal depression to shamanic path, my spirituality is not based on how many trainings, meditations, and ceremonies I have done, it\u2019s coming from a deep embodied experience to transform pain into wisdom and empowerment. The shamanic path is a way of being; we allow ourselves to go deeper within to connect all things that come from oneness. I loved my work, which has been proven to help people really change their lives. If you are curious about what this mini workshop could bring, having an open mind and open heart, you will be surprised by how much can be done just in this brief journey within.\n\n\n\nWith love,\nFery Qiu\n\n",

At Wellington Classic Literature Group we read novels that have stood the test of time, whether they were written in 1780, 1880 or even 1980. The group has been running for more than a decade and we have a great bunch of regulars as well as readers that come along for particular books or simply when it suits. We meet on the first Tuesday of the month.\n\nOur November book, and first work of poetry, is Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet (1923). Born in Lebanon in 1883 and later emigrating to the United States, Kahlil Gibran bridged East and West. His writings, poetry and art explore themes of love, spirituality and humanity.\n\nThe Prophet, his classic work of prose poetry, has been translated into more than 100 languages and is one of the best-selling books of all time. It has never gone out of print.\n\nProject Gutenberg link for those e-reading:\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/58585\n\nVENUE\nWe meet in the \u2018Games Room\u2019, The Library bar's private area overlooking Courtenay Place.

His work explores the intersection of art and science, using photography to reveal the unseen and challenge conventional notions of landscape. Over the past seven years, his research has focused on developing a site-specific and responsive approach to photographic interventions within the landscape.\nDrawing inspiration from scientific 'fieldwork,' Kay\u2019s practice involves close observation and data collection, using these methods to uncover new insights into specific environments. However, his approach extends beyond the typical scientific framework by leveraging the unique possibilities of the photographic medium. This process enables him to move beyond the traditional, idealized representation of landscapes, offering deeper, more complex interpretations.\nSeptember 25, Tararua Tramping Club (4 Moncrieff St, Mt Victoria), Doors Open at 7pm\nIf you\u2019re curious about the Wellington Photographic Society, you\u2019re welcome to attend two meetings for free before deciding whether to join.

Night sky in October\n2. Astronomy News\n3. Main talk at 7:50 pm\nTitle: The Science of Science Fiction - Professor Jan Eldridge\nFrom Lost in Space and The Jetsons to Interstellar, the science behind science fiction films and television series is pretty variable, ranging from rubbish to \u2026 quite interesting. Much of it is simply an adjunct to the special effects.The great writers (Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, Robert Heinlein, Ursula le Guin, Richard Morgan, William Gibson, and Neal Stephenson) have expanded our views of what could be. Often their work did not survive contact with Hollywood.\nA few films and TV series are truly memorable: 'Beam me up, Scotty!\u2019; \u2018The red pill\u2019; 'Exterminate!\u2019; and \u2018It\u2019s life, Jim \u2013 but not as we know it.\u2019 But the books are better.\nThis month\u2019s speaker is an esteemed astrophysicist (and neither a replicant nor a sleeve) who can provide a detailed rationale for her views.",

Brush up on your Tequila knowledge and your Salsa recipes because the next Wellington Cocktail Competition is just around the corner!\nAs to the theme for this WCC, it is \u201cTequila and Salsa food pairing\u201d The hero spirit this time around will be a surprise tequila on the night, but I can tell you it will be a reposado. The catch is, you have to pair it with a salsa that you make yourself. There are no limits on the style of cocktail you want this time around, so get creative!\nIf you would like to participate, get in touch with me or Dan ASAp as we were running low on time to organize this time around.\nMinimum 30ml of Tequila must be used in the drink and as always must be the hero spirit of the night.\nYou will be making two drinks for the judges to try and 5 minutes to make two servings of your cocktail and serve your salsa.\nThe judges may also be coerced with bribes and favours during your presentation.\nThe event will be on 28th of September and the competition will start at 6pm.\nIf you have any questions about the competition, please ask either me or Dan.\nThe main aim of this cocktail competition is to help those who may not have entered comps before, gain a bit of confidence and experience, or for people who haven\u2019t entered a comp in a while, to shake off those cobwebs.\nIt also a chance to meet new people and introduce newcomers to the Wellington bar scene. Most of all the idea is to have fun!\nEach competitor will have 5 minutes to make and present two servings of their drink.\nAll Tequila and corn chips for your salsa will be provided, but you will have to source your own ingredients including citrus and sugar syrup. Glassware and ice will be provided, you are more than welcome to bring specialty equipment and ingredients, however you will be marked on how easy your drink is to replicate.\nThe competition will be judged by a panel of 3 judges. While knowing your stuff is important, brand knowledge is not the key here. This comp is to engage bartenders in a fun comp environment, so drink and personality are just as important.\nCompetitors will be first come first serve, so message either me or Dan if you want to be entered, there are 10 spots for the night and there will be prizes for the winner.\nThere will be drink deals on the night, and make sure you bring your friends, workmates, parents ect ect to cheer you on and heckle the other competitors\u2026\nSee you all there!\n\n",

    "description": "Plant Sale, I have had great success with NZ and imported seed propagation this year so we have a wonderful range of plants ready to go in the ground now.\nSome varieties are extremely limited due to the cost of the imported seed and the tiny amount of seeds per packet (only 5 in some cases).\nWe will be accepting preorders by messenger so get in quick if you don't want to miss out on these special plants.\n$7.50 each or multiples of 3 $20\nPlease note: Our garden will not be open during the plant sale. We aim to open in approximately 5 weeks but it depends how the tulips progress.\nAs other plants reach maturity we will make them available for sale on our open days. We have decided to have a pre season sale to make room for more beauties.\nAbutilon - a range of mixed colours including peach, rose and lemon.\nDwarf Agapanthus - a fine leaved pale blue variety. Great for edging paths and beds. Will not take over.\nAubretia - Lavender trailing plant for rock walls and garden edges.\nArabis - White blooming Spring groundcover\nAjuga - Pink and purple varieties. Great November blooming groundcover for damp areas.\nAster - Early summer flowering variety in blue/lavender\nCalamintha - new for us so I shall borrow the Chiltern seeds description. This is a most pleasant plant for your border or herb garden. Heavily scented with a fragrance described as pennyroyal-like, it is an erect perennial with small, somewhat hairy leaves. In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

Gemma Hoskins is Am\u00e9lie\u2019s mother, and William Duignan plays the pop icon Elton John. A cast of thirteen takes on many roles, from greengrocers to goldfish. Produced by WITCH Music Theatre, the show captures the whimsy of the film that made Am\u00e9lie a global favourite. It features a Grammy-nominated score by Daniel Mess\u00e9 and Nathan Tyson, as well as a witty book by Craig Lucas.

    "description": "Enemy of the State, Enemy of the State\nEnemy of the State spans new music, Romantic lyricism, and one of the most incendiary works in Shostakovich\u2019s career, performed by outstanding guest artists.\n\nThe concert opens with the NZ premiere of John Psathas\u2019 Next Planet. Commissioned and premiered by the Tonhalle D\u00fcsseldorf GmbH (management company for the Tonhalle D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany) and the D\u00fcsseldorf Symphony as part of their Green Mondays project, Next Planet was premiered in June 2024 as part of a cycle of twelve \u201cGreen Pieces.\u201d Read more about the project and John's work here.\n\nThe programme continues with Alexander Glazunov\u2019s Violin Concerto in A minor, a Romantic masterpiece notable for its warmth and lyricism. Composed in 1904, the concerto weaves together heartfelt themes across its uninterrupted movements, culminating in a brilliant solo cadenza leading to to the trumpet calls heralding the final Allegro. Orchestra Wellington is delighted to welcome back Benjamin Baker, violinist and Artistic Director of At the World\u2019s Edge Festival, to perform this remarkable work.\n\nLady Macbeth of Mtsensk, Suite for Soprano and Orchestra, featuring internationally acclaimed lyric soprano Madeleine Pierard, will close the evening. Premiered in January 1934 as a massive success, in early 1936 the Russian newspaper Pravda denounced the opera in an article titled \u201cMuddle Instead of Music,\u201d sending Shostakovich\u2019s life into a tailspin. The work was banned in the Soviet Union for almost thirty years, until 1961. Orchestra Wellington Music Director Marc Taddei has crafted a suite tracing the journey of the opera\u2019s protagonist, Katerina, from isolation and passion to betrayal and despair, combining arias and orchestral interludes into a concentrated symphonic portrait. Alongside the forces of Orchesta Wellington, complemented by one of Wellington's very own A-grade brass bands, Pierard\u2019s powerful voice brings Shostakovich\u2019s heroine vividly to life, illuminating both the work\u2019s humanity and the reasons it provoked such outrage.\n\n",

Join us for an extended party session at Parrotdog, with special guest DJ Audit from Auckland. The last time we teamed up at The Yotty (RIP) in Raglan, it was the stuff of legend. Let\u2019s make it happen again - see you on the dancefloor!\n\nFUNKIN\u2019 DONUTS is a celebration of all things funky on the 7\u201d 45 vinyl format. The brand\u2019s name comes from the records themselves - small, round, and with a large hole in the middle, they\u2019ve long been nicknamed \u201cdonuts.\u201d Founded by Flex Webster in 2022, FUNKIN\u2019 DONUTS began as a jam session with fellow 45 heads before evolving into a platform for original edits and future vinyl releases. With an ultimate vision of putting out 7\u201d records, Flex has already released six albums of party edits under the brand, with plans for the first physical release coming soon. Now based in Bali, FUNKIN\u2019 DONUTS is going global - relaunching with a fresh, dancefloor-focused energy.\n\nJoining us from T\u0101maki Makaurau: DJ Audit\n\nSince 1998, Audit has been crafting an eclectic sound that transcends genres while staying rooted in Hip Hop culture. A lifelong record collector and open-format DJ, his sets seamlessly weave Disco, Hip Hop, Soul, Cumbia, and Latin rhythms into vibrant journeys. With decades of experience, a deep appreciation for musical diversity, and an instinct for reading the crowd, Audit creates electric atmospheres that keep the audience moving.\n\nHost with the most: Flex Webster\n\nFlex Webster lives and breathes music. A DJ, producer, and record collector with a career spanning almost three decades, his journey has taken him around the globe. Flex\u2019s sound blends Afrobeat, Latin, Funk, Hip Hop, Reggae, Disco, and House, reflecting the soulful rhythms of the African diaspora. Don\u2019t miss this rare B2B with old mate Audit - your last chance to catch Flex for a while, as he returns to Bali to bring his magic back to the Island of the Gods.\n\n",

This will be an evening to feast your ears on a diverse soundscape of angular guitars, melodic goodness, and glorious noise.\n\nHere\u2019s the lo-down:\n\nFirst Reserve is inevitable. Before adopting the moniker in 2023, Ryan Connaghan had been prolifically writing music that communicated their experiences in life, love, and loneliness. These themes are all approached on songs like \u201cLast One\u201d and \u201cMe & My Friends\u201d \u2013 the first offerings from First Reserve\u2019s debut EP set for release in late 2025. On stage, their sound is both intimate and larger-than-life, combining influences from alt-rock, indie-folk, and pop.\n\nDropper combines intuitive songwriting sensibilities with wall-of-sound, guitar.  Blending noise and melody, Dropper is dynamic, song-centred, high-energy indie rock. Often compared to Bob Mould\u2019s work with H\u00fcsker D\u00fc or Lou Barlow's early Sebadoh, they\u2019ve been described by one review as having a \"high energy stage performance punctuated by flawless musicianship and songwriting skills that seems beyond the years...Honestly, it\u2019s hard to overstate how impressed I was with Dropper and am eagerly awaiting my next chance to see them live.\u201d\n\nElly Mae's music encapsulates the bittersweet complexities of growth, relationships, time escaping, and the nostalgia embedded within. Her music is an amalgamation of folk, dreampop, shoegaze and whatnot.\n\nGrab your general release tickets online for just $15! Or, even better, grab an early bird ticket for only $10 and secure your spot for a night of unforgettable live music. Doors at 8pm, first act on at 8:30pm. ",

    "description": "LEAO and Romi Wrights, This October, two of Aotearoa\u2019s brightest talents come together for a one-night-only double headline show in Te Whanganui-a-Tara.\nOn Saturday, October 18th, 60s soul, funk, and R&B revivalists Romi Wrights & the Commotions join forces with fellow \"niu-wave\" sonic explorers LEAO for their debut headline performances in the capital.\nDon\u2019t miss this celebration of era-blending, electrifying Pacific journeys through sound.\nTickets on sale Friday August 1 at meow.nz\n\nLEAO\nFormed from a Pacific heart, LEAO is a Samoan musical project led byguitarist/vocalist David Feauai-Afaese, joined by bassistNavakatoa Tekela-Pule, Hawaiian-steel guitarist Levi Gemmell, and drummer Larsen Tito-Taylor.\nWith a deep adoration for Pacific musical reference points and a desire to explore new sonic ground, LEAO synthesises non-traditional tonalities with a fa\u2018asamoa spirit, creating\nwhat some have called \u201cniu wave\u201d and \u201cPacific neo-psychedelia.\u201d\nA creative enigma and phenomenal live act since the release of their critically acclaimed debut GHOST ROADS in 2019, LEAO has continued to expand its vision with the 2024 single TAEAO / MEA UMA - a sparkling glimpse into a significant body of alternative Pacific music currently in development. The group is now actively\nworking towards the release of a new full-length album, deepening their bold contribution to contemporary Pacific sound.\n\nRomi Wrights\nAlthough she grew up on the sensibilities of US RnB and Hip-hop, when the Tokelauan singer-songwriter Romi Wrights shares her voice, it\u2019s hard not to feel transported back to the spirit of the late 1960s soul/funk era by her incandescent melodies and stirring\nstories of love, loss and the confusion that lies in between. Raised between Porirua and the Hutt Valley, Romi started writing diaristic poetry at age eight before beginning to set her words to music during her teenage years.\n\nAfter finishing high school, she moved to T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland) to study music at the EXCEL School of Performing Arts and pursue her dreams of being a singer. Several years later she formed the gospel, funk and soul band The Elected, who spent three years performing at venues like Portland Public House, Kings Arms and Golden Dawn.\n\nSince 2021, she has been working alongside M\u0101nuka Recordings co-founder Kenny Sterling and a cast of session musicians and backing vocalists, including Julien Dyne, Cory Champion, Olivia Wilding, JY Lee. In December 2023, Wrights opened for soul legend Lee Fields, at the Hollywood Avondale, and has since performed twice at P\u014dneke\nfestival CubaDupa. Via M\u0101nuka Recordings, she has released 3 singles; Bring It Back, Without You and Capsized and has an album scheduled for release\nmid to late 2025.\n",

This grassroots music series is built for the people, by the people, shining a spotlight on bands who grind it out, carve their own paths, and keep live music alive.\n\nNui Hui 7 is a one-night-only collision of sounds and scenes, bringing together rock, reggae, punk, grunge, and soul against a true blue-collared backdrop. No industry machines, no corporate gloss \u2013 just raw, rising talent backed by the passion of locals and volunteers who believe in the power of music.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup is stacked with unsigned and upcoming artists from across the region and beyond:\n\n4PM \u2013 Munkiez\n\nWith a sound as cheeky and chaotic as their name suggests, MUNKIEZ is a bluesy, funk-rock explosion that proves good times and great grooves go hand-in-hand. Hailing from Upper Hutt, this crew is all about embracing the raw energy of rock and roll while slathering on a thick coat of soulful, slinky funk.\nThey're not here to reinvent the wheel, but to make it spin faster, dirtier, and with a whole lot more swagger. With a dash of that no-nonsense, straight-outta-the-garage Kiwi attitude. MUNKIEZ are a band you feel in your bones, a sound that gets your head nodding and your feet moving before you even realize what's happening. They play it like they mean it, because they do.\n\n5PM \u2013 The Groundsmen\n\nScott Paddock and Shane Martin formed The Groundsmen back in the heady days of 2017 and went through various drummers and bass players before finally finding stability with drummer Rowan Carlyle in 2018.\n\nSince then they\u2019ve played numerous gigs (one supporting Head Like A Hole in Gisborne at Smash Palace 30th anniversary) and released 3 singles on Spotify and other streaming platforms - Black Car, Supanova and Achtung Baby (check them out!).\n\nThey\u2019ve recorded their debut album and are just about to mix it and release it.\n\nPlaying only original earthen rock punk, we always, always, perform at 110% energy levels and put on a great show with hooky uptempo toons!! With songs commenting on contemporary society and life at large all 3 members throw themselves fully into their performance and leave no energy unused. You will leave one of their shows changed.\n\nSee the excerpt from a review of a in Whanganui July 2020:\n\n\u201cAfter a quick change of equipment, The Groundsmen were next on the agenda. Proclaiming themselves to be Taranaki\u2019s premier rock punk band, the trio wasted no time in belting out a hard and fast set of original, classic punk-inspired tunes that were lapped up by the growing gathering of punters. Bass player Scott Paddock is a tour-de-force; full of noise, energy and an appropriate rock-punk swagger. Along with guitarist Shane Martin and drummer Rowan Carlyle, The Groundsmen powered their way though and energetic set, and it was immediately evident that they were ecstatic to be back on stage and performing again after the recent enforced hiatus. The trio powered through a set of classic, no-frills, original punk inspired tracks that had almost everyone in the room either on their feet or gyrating in their seats. Definitely a crowd-pleaser, there is no doubt whatsoever that The Groundsmen were in their element, and clearly love what they do.\u201d\n\n\u2026.from Ambient Light, author Bridget Herlihy, 4th July 2020\n\n6PM \u2013 Kaletta Band\n\nKaletta is a Latin rock band that brings together the rhythms of ska punk and gypsy sounds in Spanish. With musicians from Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Italy, the UK, and New Zealand, our sound is a blend of different beats and roots. We've had the privilege of being two-time national finalists in the Battle of the Bands (BOTB 2024 and 2025) and have performed at festivals like Island Bay and toured the top South Island. We're excited about our upcoming tours in New Zealand next year.\n\nWhat we're passionate about is creating music that's true to ourselves. Each song is a journey, moving from calm to energetic moments that we hope will keep you engaged. Our lyrics touch on social and political themes, and we hope our performances will inspire thought and conversation. We're looking forward to sharing our music with you and creating memorable experiences through our dynamic sound and energy.\n\n7PM \u2013 Burning Embers\n\nAccustomed to breaching anything that requires sociable etiquette they still manage to pull off their unique brand of Wainuiomata rock.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, they regroup, drink a few, set a plan, and do the complete opposite in tasteful fashion. Burning Embers have an uncanny habit of pulling off a great set, usually unscripted but full of the essence that is Rock n Roll. We're not here long enough to care, but we do love a great audience\nReminiscent of Days of the New and Alice in Chains they're definitely genuine entertainment\n\n8PM \u2013 Stretch to Mould\n\nStretch to Mould is a rock band from Wellington New Zealand who formed in 2012. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Darrell Vickers, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line up changes. Since 2024 the line up has consisted of Vickers alongside Chris Fursdon (bass guitar) and Thomas Fuller (Drums). Stretch to Mould are known for their high energy, hard hitting riffs, powerful vocals and all-round solid musicianship. The band released their debut album Shadows in 2012, EP Painting Faces in 2014 and are currently working on their next release.\n\n9PM \u2013 Ras Judah and the Culture Embassy\n\na 10-piece NZ band of varying cultural backgrounds, hence the name.\nThe cultural diversity of the band is reflected in the sound of the music\na fusion of African styles, Reggae/Ska, Jazz and Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nWe describe our sound as Afrocentric-World Music as much of what we play is based on African rhythms and songs, which is where our lead-singer \u2018Ras Judah\u2019 and two of our master drummers come from (Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania respectively), plus Roots Reggae. Though everyone contributes their own culturally inspired sound, with other band members from Cuba, England and Japan, and others with Greek, Kiwiana and jazz backgrounds. Not just a musical treat representing many parts of the world, but also a visual one; a carnival of ethnic diversity and collaboration on stage!\n\n10PM \u2013 The Fabulous Pakehas\n\nWere first conceived in London England, way back in the early 90s whilst on O.E's. Currently working on a album, & after 33 years, still in no rush.\nWith two of us having roots in WOA TFP are honoured to be playing a set of our originals for NUI HUI 7\nThe T.F.P original line up are, Antony Maddock, Scott McGill, Leslie Tearne, &\nBevan Ritchie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom soul-stirring grooves to fist-in-the-air anthems, Nui Hui 7 is more than just a gig \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of musicians who hustle, create, and share their art on their own terms.\n\nNui Hui: supporting local, celebrating original, and keeping the fire of live music burning\n\nhttps://www.undertheradar.co.nz/tour/30764/Nui-Hui-7.utr\n\n",

Bookings are essential with payment on the night in cash please. Admission is a modest $20 pp so if you have the means and have enjoyed the night, there is a red box for any koha you may wish to give. Bookings are to Dale at , and a small supper contribution is appreciated, byo is also welcomed.\n\nBecause there may be self-contained folk travelling to Wellyfest, please consider coming and staying over in the paddock.

He is joined in Wellington by drummer extraordinaire Isaac Levi Tucker, producer-performer-poet Miss Leading, Raiatea synth artist Gotal Bournier and dancer Tokyo dancer Misako Kikuchi.\n\nPeter Hobbs\nKnown for his award-winning cinematic and emotional body of work in recordings and immersive art works, Hobbs' new album Panpsychism is a vehicle for his masterful songwriting driven by experimental beats on a highway of immersive synth soundscapes, through an immersive visual-reactive world.\nHe is performing his modular synths and immersive AV show alongside legendary percussionist and drummer Isaac Levi Tucker.\nMiss Leading\nAn electronic music producer, singer and poet. Her music aims to widen your mind while moving your body with a mix of pop, hip-hop, spoken ambient and dance tracks with a conscious perspective in relation to race, feminism, sexuality and environment. Her debut album Minor Thing received five-star reviews and gained critical acclaim by independent music magazines across the UK, Brazil, Germany and the USA, including being labelled UK Artist of the Week by The Vinyl District.\n\nGotal Bournier\nGotal Bournier is a French electronic musician living between Tahiti and Tokyo. Between 2012 and 2017 he released four albums in Japan with the band Lo-shi. Since 2018 he has been based on the island of Ra\u02bbi\u0101tea, working on solo recordings and various live collaborative projects. His current solo project is a playful and wryly nostalgic live soundtrack to a video collage of Cold War Era science fiction films using the spectral, alien tones of twin modular synthesisers.\n\nMisako Kikuchi\nAfter studying classical ballet at an early age, Tokyo-born dancer Misako Kikuchi went on to explore modern ballet, contemporary dance, street dance and flamenco, while refining her own improvisational approach. Her performances create uncontrived moments of beauty that make you feel that being alive is not irreconcilable with being free\n\n",

The lyrics paint loathsome, frightening images of pitch-black self-hatred and the frailty of the human experience. These musical manifestations only serve to cement their already legendary status. Having not been in Australia and New Zealand since 2008, PIG DESTROYER\u2019s long overwaited return has just one goal. To unnerve the unprepared with a deranged, grisly intensity which very few, if any, can match.\nRecently reforming to the original line-up, Singapore\u2019s WORMROT resume their genius in unleashing exquisite noise together, with the announcement of a new album 'TNT'. Grinding faces with the best of them, their performances are intense, spectacular, furious, with a barrage of unrelenting, head-caving abuse, honed by a singular determination to destroy the competition.\nwww.facebook.com/TheRealPigDestroyer\n\nwww.facebook.com/wormrot\n\nwww.swdpresents.com ",

    "description": "Raven Mavens Quartette in concert, Raven Mavens Quartette\nSuppose you can imagine the sound of the blues, spiced by flavours of the American songbook, folk, country, and even the rock and roll of Jerry Lee Lewis, driven by the unmistakable sound of boogie woogie piano. In that case, you have the Raven Mavens Quartette.  \n\nIt is both an accident and it isn\u2019t that this is an all-female group. The group had its genesis a decade ago when piano player and singer-songwriter Cindy Muggeridge encountered the singing and clarinet skills of Marian Carter. They formed the Raven Mavens as a duo that included a core of folk and blues, and exploited the singing talents of the pair through finely crafted harmonies.  \n\nThe success of their combination in playing local gigs and folk festivals opened up opportunities with other musicians, and the next step was the inclusion of drummer Anje Glindemann, who has played in a list of local bands, including Tin Pan Alley, Hen Picked and more recently the Salty Hearts. Anje can also be seen performing with Kapiti Coast singer-songwriter icon Andrew London.  And finally, the addition of multi-instrumentalist Kate Marshall. \u201cKate is an amazing player\u201d, Cindy says. \u201cShe can move as easily from piano accordion, to fiddle or flute, depending on what the song calls for - or she feels like playing!\u201d And of course, like the other members of the group, she sings.  \n\nThe instrumental diversity of the line-up was now established, but what also distinguishes this group is the addition of Cindy Muggeridge\u2019s original songs to the set. \u201cWriting my own songs has been part of the musical journey for me\u201d, says Cindy, \u201cand it just led naturally to offering some of them to the other singers in the group\u201d. The \u201cfun\u201d of their music and the unmistakable presence of four female musical masters is what they will be sharing when they play at The Offering as part of Greytown ArtTown.\n\nBuy tickets in advance here or txt bookings to 02102361951.\n\nPlease note The Offering is fully licensed and will be serving snacks and drinks. Please note this concert replaces Bob McNeill and Emily Roughton due to illness.",

    "description": "Shawn James - Wellington, Shawn James \u2013 New Zealand Tour October 2025\nChristchurch \u2022 Wellington \u2022 Auckland\nFor the first time ever, acclaimed American singer-songwriter Shawn James is bringing his powerful, soul-stirring music to New Zealand. Known for his raw vocals, heartfelt lyrics, and a genre-defying blend of folk, blues, rock, and soul, Shawn has captivated audiences around the globe.\nFollowing a massive international tour and the rise of his hit song \"Through the Valley\" -featured in the critically acclaimed The Last of Us series - Shawn is thrilled to announce his debut run across Aotearoa.\nCatch him live this October for three unforgettable shows:\nWednesday, October 15 - Loons, Christchurch\nThursday, October 16 - San Fran, Wellington\nFriday, October 17 - Double Whammy, Auckland\nTickets are on sale this Friday the 30th of May at 1:00 pm\nPre sale starts tomorrow, Thursday the 29th of May at 1:00 pm\nDon't miss this rare chance to experience the intensity and emotion of Shawn James in an intimate live setting. Tickets are expected to move fast - secure yours now!\n\"Hey there, this is Shawn James. I\u2019ve had way too many writers think they could sum me up & relay what I\u2019m about from an hour long conversation so they could write my \u201cbio\u201d but I\u2019ve had it. Screw that. I\u2019ll tell it in my own words.\nI was born & raised in Chicago, Illinois. I grew up on the south side of the city where I attended a gospel church. I was always around a lot of heartfelt soulful music & hardworking, real, down to earth people. Although I no longer abide by any religion, I value the times I had and how they shaped me to be what I am now. I\u2019ve moved around quite a bit living in all different parts of the US.\nWhile absorbing all sorts of different cultures from here & around the world, I\u2019ve developed my own sound. I started releasing my own music in 2012 and haven\u2019t stopped since. I play a wide range of music from folk to blues, r&b, Gospel to rock, metal & alotta things in between. The main constant amongst all the genres would be that it\u2019s all done with emotion, feeling, heart & a lotta soul. I mean what I say & deeply feel what I play.\nI play covers of songs I dig sometimes and although some people may only know me because of those, I\u2019m hardly just a cover artist.\nIf you come see me play live and expect just one style or aspect of what I do, you may be disappointed to learn that our shows are a roller coaster of emotions, musical styles, intensity & energy. I get bored easily & love to mix things up. Be ready & bring your ear plugs just in case..\nI\u2019ve always been the underdog so to speak since I\u2019ve never had the backing of a large record label, big marketing firm or massive PR company & I truly like it that way. I feel as though I\u2019ve earned what I have through hard work, determination, a good bit of luck & the great relationships with people I\u2019ve made along the way. I\u2019ve learned a lot of lessons the hard way being in this \u201cmusic business industry\u201d and that\u2019s alright by me.\nI\u2019ve seen that with your support (the listeners out there) I can make my wildest dreams come true.\nIf you want to listen to an artist that\u2019s authentic, genuine & original then you\u2019ve come to the right place. I hope you enjoy the music & will join me on this journey that I\u2019m so extremely grateful to be on.\nThank you all so very much.\nLove,\nShawn James\" ",

It draws inspiration from urban isolation and the weight of expectations. Tracks from the EP have landed on major Spotify and Apple playlists. Reflecting the office environment, familiar to many, this performance will bring to life the themes from the EP in a host of ways.\nWith over 2.2 million streams across platforms and 1.8 million on Spotify alone, his impact is growing. Releases have landed on global and regional editorial playlists. His EPs\u2014Fantasy, Monarch, SugarCoated and now F.O.M.O \u2014have consistently showcased his range and evolution as an artist.\nSig Wilder & Friends blend kiwi authenticity with American grit, bringing you a well-worn handwritten journal of lived experiences rendered through metaphor, poetic prose, and the stylistic conventions of folk, alt-country and late-night heartbreak radio.\nJosh Glennie is a soulful singer/songwriter based in Wellington, New Zealand. He's made a name for himself playing in bands around Wellington and is now striking out with his own solo material. Together with Tarn, they have produced a new EP of songs that cut to the bone, focused around acoustic guitar and Josh's striking vocals. His New EP is expected late 2025/early 2026. ",

What if swamp rock wasn't born in Louisiana, but in Takaka you ask? What if Iggy Pop and the Stooges had been Marlborough dairy farmers? What if Hendrix had settled in a Tukurua art gallery selling homemade jewellery crafted from shells and bone? The answer to all these questions and more can be found at a Cowpokers gig: a raw, barn-storming, rural-rock-and-roll sensation that 23 years of gigging has utterly failed to hone, polish, or refine.\nTYSON SMITH: Wellington-based guitarist/singer/songwriter Tyson Smith will be bringing his unique, original music combining elements of rock, blues, folk, world music and freeform improvisation.\nTyson has worked as a guitarist with acts ranging from the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to vocalist Hollie Smith, before focusing on his own music in the last few years.\nIn 2024 he celebrated 10 years since the release of his album The Hollow Tree with Rick Cranson and Ed Zuccollo, and released his new single Wolves. Tyson has been performing regularly around various New Zealand venues and festivals with his raw and exciting sound both with the trio and solo (utilising multiple amps and a bass drum). ",

Exploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different sounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, \"it came from this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to track\", explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the band then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in Wellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy Auckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also be playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New York for North American shows this June.\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of mental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song, and more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to a new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the title suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019. Adding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier Man\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that \"striving to be a better and happier person should be a goal for everyone.\" \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019 is an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album closer \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the beast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and touring.\nTickets go on sale 12pm, Wednesday 28 May.

With a string of releases on Berlin-based PHTM, T\u0101maki Makaurau-based Gypnotica, and an impressive catalog of self-releases, he consistently showcases his singular and original interpretation of dance music.\nInstagram.com/e.li\nelihoff.bandcamp.com\nabyssalsoundworks.bandcamp.com\n\nHUNTER \u2014 Hang the Saints / Haven\nRaised in Kaik\u014dura, Aotearoa, Hunter's dark and atmospheric sound often contrasts the beautiful environment she grew up in. Her direct approach to techno draws influence from heavy percussion, bold rhythm and industrial soundscapes. After spending two years finding inspiration in clubs overseas, she has returned to \u014ctautahi with a refined style that\u2019s ready to make people dance. As the co-founder of \u201cHang The Saints\u201d and resident of \u201cHaven\u201d, Hunter is all about creating safe, inclusive spaces for people to connect through the music she loves.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sspoonsnake/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hunter-mccrory-334790608\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/bC3qeA6pUxBoMo7P9\n\nLUDUS & RIZZO \u2014 Tonic Collective\nTonic Collective is the recent endeavour of Ludus and Rizzo, inspired by the people, places and spaces of their experience touring China with BIRDPARTY and Vera Ellen. Both acts are individually known for their versatile and innovative sound, bringing a wide range of influences and inspirations to the dancefloor. In the short time since establishing the collective, they\u2019ve already hosted Kaishandao and Bone Chapel, established a space, and debuted a monthly radio show on Mouthfull that explores sound from across the genre spectrum, both in the club and out.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ludus.etc/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/alicerizzoofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tonic.collective/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/l-s.../416life-support-cl1n1c-chengdu\nhttps://soundcloud.com/racquetclub-info/mix-series-016-ludus\n\nSHLI \u2014 Echo Train Records / Warehouse Rave / Holding Hands\nShli is the alias of \u014ctautahi-via-P\u014dneke DJ and Producer Tim Ward. Steadily releasing works over recent years through local labels like Echo Train and the Big Fresh Collective, he is carving out a sound of his own.\nStitching together infectious rhythms layered over low-end pressure, Shli\u2019s sets draw influence from across the hardcore continuum and beyond.

The Aeronaut is currently still a work in progress; this evening offers keen punters a chance to watch Vorn and his frighteningly good band (Nick Brown - Drums; Charley Davenport - Bass, Thomas Liggett - Violin) iron out the final kinks on a future Kiwi classic. Be there so you can say you were!\nhttps://vornpowertool.bandcamp.com/\nThagomizer is the dino synth project (dinosaur themed dungeon synth) of Caspar Kneale (yes, he is related, in fact mr Birchville Cat Motel is Caspar's Dad).

These works reflect a compositional approach shaped by both the harmonic and improvisational sensibilities of contemporary jazz pianists such as Brad Mehldau, Robert Glasper, and Aaron Parks, and the rhythmic, melodic, and resonant qualities of indigenous Samoan music, drawn from my own cultural heritage. This synthesis seeks to articulate a distinctly Pasifika jazz sound. This performance marks the live debut of the full suite of compositions, which have been recorded and are set to be released later this year.",

    "description": "Wendyhouse / DSLB / vegetable.machine.animal, Wendyhouse are Bryce Galloway and Daniel Powell (AKA Mr Pudding and EE monk). The pair met at the Elam School of Fine Arts. Wendyhouse got their name from debut performances at Art Space (T\u0101maki Makaurau) where they sang songs set in the year 2032 from inside a Wendy house (Soundwatch \u201992). A prolific creative period followed before EE monk relocated to Europe in 1995. Wendyhouse output has been somewhat sporadic ever since, but with EE monk\u2019s recent return, the pair have returned to performing live.\nWendyhouse music was initially played on toy musical instruments, the kind that fit inside a Wendy house. Real instruments were added as the band moved out of the house and onto the stage.\nThe music is best described as lo fi inverted pop music, with lyrics about unlikely topics. For example, the two newest songs in the Wendyhouse are an existential treatise on real estate and a love/hate ode to Futurist Luigi Russolo. Guitar, toy keyboard and vocals are the Wendyhouse instruments of choice.\n---\n\nDSLB\nDSLB is the solo project of Chrissie Butler (the shouty bass playing half of the now sleeping duo, mr sterile Assembly). An offshoot from Chrissie's other band Ditzy Squall, DSLB (Ditzy Squall's Lunch Box) is a showcase for a love of long endings and the hum things make when you hold them close to your ear. Performed live, DSLB is an improvised mash-up of ancient record players, purring keyboards, kitchen utensils and found objects. Soundtracks for short films and hand drawn comics are also residents in the lunch box. Recordings are released by skirted Records.\nhttps://skirtedrecords.com/dslb/\n---\nvegetable.machine.animal\nNew solo project courtesy of Mr Sterile, in which living fungal and plantlife inform a modular synthesiser with biofeedback. This signal acts upon the synth changing the pitch, tone, rate and more in the delivery of sound. These \u2018curated\u2019 sounds are then responded to with percussion.

    "description": "XCOMMUNICATE, The formidable powerhouse duo COMMUNICATE return to Wellington in November with their clubnight, XCOMMUNICATE, for one night only.\nKnown for their long sets that incorporate decades of sound, Cyril Orson and Heylady have been punishing dance floors across Aotearoa since they joined forces 3 years ago. Off the back of a monstrous summer, which saw them play 19 shows up and down the country, the pair have spent most of 2025 in the studio finessing their own brand of audio alchemy and preparing to release their label, also named XCOMMUNICATE.\nUsually XCOMMUNICATE is a 6 hour journey though decades and sonic realms, however as Heylady is still recovering from a mighty dose of burnout they\u2019ve roped in a couple of their good friends, who happen to be some of Wellington\u2019s finest, to join them as they lay down four hours of four to the floor. \nHalo is a mainstay on Wellington dancefloors and it was a no brainer asking her to be on this lineup. A DJ since 2000, she has played festivals across the country and never fails to rock her slot. Her set at Taniwha\u2019s Den last summer was a big highlight and one of the best of the festival. Halo\u2019s ability to drive forward thinking sound and her clever construction of sets are just two reasons you need to be on her floor.\nDJ Coda is the godfather of techno in New Zealand. With a career that spans decades, he isn\u2019t just a DJ but a dedicated promoter and one of the owners of NZ\u2019s longest running student radio station, Radioactive. Part of the COMMUNICATE family from the get go (and a longtime collaborator of Heylady\u2019s), DJ Coda is a master of his craft and never fails to deliver. Armed with knowledge , taste and a hefty love of Detroit, DJ Coda is the man when it comes to rocking the dance floor.\nFirst release tickets are on sale now, grab yours before they are gone and come and dance the evening away with four of the best. We recommend arrive early so you don\u2019t miss out on any of the sets, they are all going to be killer.\nIMPORTANT INFO:\nOur event is a safe space for all. If you or someone you know is feeling unsafe or harassed, please approach one of the DJs or bar staff. If you are behaving badly and impacting others ability to have a good time safely, you will be removed. Please act with respect and care for your fellow attendees at all times, no means no and this goes for conversations as well as more intimate requests. ",

Be prepared to drop into a deep space.\nDoor sales will be available if there is space. Advanced booking is recommended.\n\nSika's Sound Journeys are truly unique. They are sonic explorations that feature didgeridoos, drums, flutes, voice and orchestral elements. A collection of foraged sounds from objects he has recorded in nature, add even more textures. Many of his sounds are completely unrecognisable and abstract. Immersed in this cocoon of abstract sound, we can find ourselves in the most surprising places in our mind. In this timeless realm, beyond the normal limitations of rational reality, anything is possible.\n\nAn epic adventure deep inside yourself.\n\nJourney to worlds within worlds on incredible sound waves.\n\nSika creates a safe space to relax deeply and connect with our inner guidance. This Sound Journey begins and ends with a short guided visualisation.\n\nThere will be two journeys with an interval. Most people choose to lie down, so once again, please bring a yoga mat, pillow and blanket to get really comfortable.\n\nA journal is also recommended.",

He spent his high school years in Northern Ontario and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and three children.\nWesley is currently the Central Canada Director for Apologetics Canada and has been a guest on a variety of public platforms, from The Joe Rogan Experience and Piers Morgan Uncensored, to Apologia Radio and Daily Dose of Wisdom. He has participated in numerous public dialogues, debates, and interfaith events on issues of belief and religion globally.\nHe holds a BA in sociology from York University, a Masters of Theological Studies from Tyndale University, and is currently doing a PhD in New Testament at the University of Toronto\u2019s Wycliffe College.
