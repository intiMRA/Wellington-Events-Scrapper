With biting wit, Chloe lays bare the heartbreak of rejection from the world she adores, and turns that pain into power. This is a story of survival, self-discovery, and the ultimate comeback: becoming the best version of yourself when the system says you don\u2019t belong.

For Wayne, his family and his work were his life. They were the source of his life's pleasure and purpose and now he is having to cope with the loss of both.\n\nThe only thing left to take his mind off the pain is cycling with his MAMIL friends, especially Bryan, the central character of MAMIL. But a panic attack mid-ride and a crash with catastrophic consequences leads to a crisis of cycling confidence and the inability to do the thing he loves the most.\n\nLike MAMIL, it takes an array of characters to help the central character rediscover what is truly important when their life seems adrift and meaningless.

Peter is reluctant to stay with nanna in the school holidays because she lives in the country and doesn't have a TV but Nanna finds ways to engage Peter in her love of the forest, especially the precious manu, when they build a nesting box for Ruru together. Peter is excited to see if Ruru will make her home in the box, waiting patiently while many other birds arrive to check out the box first! And after all that waiting, Nanna takes Peter on an exciting night time forest walk to find Ruru - in the dark! The bird characters are all familiar New Zealand locals, such as piwakawaka, kereru, tui and ruru, and the story highlights the importance of supporting them and the different needs they may have. Teachers and Parents have been ecstatic about this show and hundreds of New Zealand children have been transfixed by it.\nAs quoted by Theatreview: \u201cThis is truly a New Zealand show for New Zealand children and all those young-at-heart\u201d.",

While there\u2019s no obligation to stay for dinner, sharing a meal together offers a meaningful way to strengthen connections. Andre and Sri Jiva co-host this circle with a shared passion for creating authentic, supportive spaces where men can connect deeply\u2014offering this gathering simply because they believe in its importance.\nThe Men\u2019s Circle provides a safe and nurturing environment where men can share openly, express their feelings, and encourage personal growth\u2014free from societal pressures to be stoic or self-reliant. Through honest sharing and collective support, participants build resilience, deepen self-awareness, and strengthen their sense of identity and purpose.\nStructure of the Circle\nGathering in a Circle: Participants sit in a circle to symbolize equality and unity.\nA short meditation or moment of silence may be included to help everyone arrive and connect.\nTalking Object: A sharing stick or object is placed in the center. Only the person holding the object may speak, ensuring uninterrupted sharing.\nOpen Sharing: Anyone may choose to share while holding the object. Sharing is optional, and passing is always respected.\nActive Listening: While one person shares, others listen attentively without speaking, interrupting, or offering advice. The focus is on witnessing and being present.\nNo Judgments or Advice: Participants refrain from judging or offering unsolicited advice, creating a safe space for authentic expression.\nClosing: The circle may conclude with a group reflection, a moment of gratitude, or a simple acknowledgment of the shared experience.\nCircle Agreements\nSupportive Environment: We are here to uplift and support one another, fostering trust and brotherhood.\nFocus on the Present: Share what's alive for you now, focusing on your emotions and experiences to deepen emotional awareness.\nUse \"I\" Statements: Speak from your personal perspective using \"I\" statements to promote authenticity and responsibility. Avoid generalizations like \"we\" or \"us.\"\nNo Judgment or fixing: Refrain from judging others sharing or offering unsolicited advice, ensuring a safe and non-critical space.\nConfidentiality: What is shared in the circle stays in the circle. You may discuss your own experience outside the group, but keep others' details private.\nMeet Andre and Sri Jiva, your hosts\nAndre has been immersed in men\u2019s work since the age of 13, when he first experienced a rite of passage in Golden Bay. That formative experience sparked a lifelong connection to circle work, which he later deepened by returning as a mentor. A multi-instrumental musician, poet, and pranayama (breathwork) facilitator, Andre also brings his passion for ecstatic dance, philosophy, and authentic connection into his offerings. He is deeply inspired by the question of what it means to be human\u2014how we can more fully experience our aliveness, our depth, and reconnecting with the beauty of life together.\nSince childhood, Sri Jiva has been fascinated by meaning, purpose, and authentic life fulfilment. This, among other things, led him to join a monastery at the age of 19. After years of monastic training, he chose to marry and pursue a career. He felt called to use his monastic experience to help others understand themselves, and to find wisdom, meaning, and purpose in their own lives. Inspired by this calling, he went to university to study counselling. Now, Sri Jiva and his wife live near Wellington, where he works with a small team of counsellors, supporting clients individually and in groups.\n................................................................................................\nBooking for Thursday is recommended!\nFor more details and to book please go here--\nhttps://bit.ly/eventTickets\n...............................................................................................\nMake Thursdays your night to connect and take a break from your week.

In summer it bears numerous whorled spikes of tiny blue flowers with long purple bracts. The herb can be used for flavouring. Flowers the first year from seed. 1\u00bdft (45cm).\nCampanula glomerata - deep purple\nCerastium - grey trailing leaves smothered in white blooms in Spring. (These have just been cut back)\nCerinthe - By popular demand. Technically an annual but a non invasive self sowing one so once its in your garden you'll have more each year. Glaucous foliage and interesting pendular purple blooms.\nDianthus - Grey leaves and red blooms\nErigeron multiradiatus - A beautiful evergreen groundcover with yellow centred purple/blue daisies from late spring.\nErysimum - a specialty for us as we love them so much. What's not to love? Front to mid border, semi shrubby evergreen perennial, glorious scented blooms and we have individual named colours.\nIvory, Purple bi-colour, Fire King, Vulcan, Ellen Willmott, Primrose, Ruby gem, Siberian allionii and the brand new Tangerine Titan.\nEuphorbia - golden foam. Another newbie for us but we love the the chartreuse euphorbias add to the garden so we had to give it a go.\nEuphorbia characias - the blue leaved evergreen semi shrubs with huge chartreuse heads that grace our garden every spring.\nGeum - Yes, you guessed it, another favourite of ours. We have a good stock of the common types plus some more unusual ones.\nTall - Yellow, Red and Orange (Firestorm).\nDwarf - Deep orange/red, Lemon with hints of pink, blush (very pale pink) and the original geum rivale in a beautiful coppery peach.\nLunaria (Honesty). Two types available. Chedglow the purple leaf version that has taken Chelsea by storm the last couple of years. Variegata - the green leaves become edged in white in their second year before blooming with the typical mauve flowers.\nLysimachia nummularis - yellow creeping jenny. Great lime leaf trailing plant for part shady damp areas. One only.\nOrlaya grandiflora - another favourite among designers. A self sowing annual that will provide weeks of beautiful white lacecap flowers. Perfect for filling in border spaces until the summer perennials fill in or to give a light airy feel to meadows and spring plantings. Seedlings will return year after year.\nPelargonium - Deep red\nPulmonaria - Raspberry splash\nRomulea - small bulbs grow fine grassy leaves before erupting into a mass of deep rosy purple crocus type flowers in late spring.\nScabiosa - another specialty plant for us as they provide such amazing flower power all summer and autumn. They are not frost hardy but are perennial in sheltered spots for at least 3 years. Enjoy the flowers and at the end of the season collect several packets worth of seed to multiply your stock.\nNamed varieties available:\nSnowmaiden - white, Black Knight - deep maroon, Beaujolias Bonnets - a gorgeous blend of pink, white and burgundy on the same flower, Burgundy beau - a new one this year, Salmon Queen - the most delicious shade of salmon pink. Pale yellow Fata morgana, and blue ones will be available later in the season.\nStachys officinalis - dark pink flowered evergreen groundcover. Perfect for the front of garden beds and rock gardens.\nSissyrinchium blue eyed grass. Low grassy leaves burst in to a mass of blue star shaped flowers in Spring.\nSedum mexicana - a bright lime evergreen succulent groundcover. Perfect for supporting bold tulips in spring and bright perennials in summer.\nSedum Mr Goodbud. A slightly pinker version than the well known Autumn joy.\nSparaxia - very special maroon flowers. Couple only.\nSymphytum grandiflora - low-lying evergreen groundcover with medium sized leaves and stunning cream bell flowers all through spring. Excellent spreading plant for difficult to grow areas such as the shade of evergreen trees.\nUrospermum - sown last spring and flowered for the first time in summer. Don't be put off by its dandelion looking leaves. This is a beauty with huge lemon flowers ( yes again like a dandelion but oh so much more beautiful). It has survived a wet winter in our gravel garden and also in soil. Definitely not a weed!\nViolets - green leaf with white scented flowers and the later flowering purple leaved Viola labadorica with purple flowers.\n\n\n\n",

The story involves a 'child' (L'enfant) whose awful behaviour brings an unexpected response: first the furniture rebels, the grandfather clock, the broken china cup, then the mathematics tutor and the Princess in the fairy tale book come to life, and eventually all the animals in the garden - squirrels, dragonfly, birds rise up - all of whom have good reason to 'teach the child a lesson'. It's a fabulous journey that we go on with the child who is confronted by all of these and indeed learns...\nThis is a project involving the whole of the Classical Performance programme: the voice students sing all the roles, each performing several roles, the NZSM orchestra will play for the performances, and the piano students are taking part as rehearsal pianists (r\u00e9p\u00e9titeurs) and playing in the orchestra.",

But since I have to write something in this box and you seem compelled to read it, let\u2019s both reflect on the wonder of a 25-year career spent labouring in prolific obscurity, across 9 albums of songs which veer from sublime to ridiculous, often within a single verse.
