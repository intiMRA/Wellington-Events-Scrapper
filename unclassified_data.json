    "description": "Jazz Orchestra Composer Series Presents Louisa Williamson, The ninth concert in this series of Aotearoa composers features the multi-talented saxophonist/composer Louisa Williamson.\n\nSince completing a Masters of Music in Composition in 2020, she has released two albums of original music (What Dreams May Come and Groundwork). In 2023 Louisa won the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award for her piece Dream Within A Dream, and in 2024 Louisa received a composition commission from the Wellington Jazz Festival and headlined the festival with the new work, The Chasm Where We Fall Into Each Other.  Louisa has worked with L.A.B, Bret McKenzie, AJA, The Rodger Fox Big Band, Royal NZ Air Force Band, Trinity Roots and Lord Echo.\n\nThis commission opportunity has come at a perfect time for me to process some recent grief and pain that\u2019s inhabited my circles. Whilst composing this music, I\u2019ve thought about ideas around mental health, specifically with youth in Aotearoa, and also honouring some friends who have passed. I think artists have the ability to turn heartbreak into beauty, and this music is an attempt at that. Although the inspiration which generated the music is heavy, the performance itself will hopefully feel light and reflective (turning heartbreak into beauty = darkness into light!), and will embrace and celebrate the talents of the musicians who are playing. I\u2019ve brought together a beautiful group of people who I know will handle this music with care and fortitude\n\nBryn van Vliet - alto/flute\nTyaan Singh - alto sax\nLouisa Williamson - tenor/flute\nEilish Wilson - baritone sax\nSylvester Green - trumpet\nKaia Johnstone - trumpet\nKaito Walley - trombone\nJakob Elijas - trombone\nAnna Lee - euphonium\nSam Zhu - tuba\nLeonardo Coghini - piano\nJacob Hurst - bass\nMax Sheehan - drums\n\nThe Jazz Orchestra Composer Series showcases original music for large jazz ensemble by New Zealand composers. Concerts take place every 1st and 3rd Friday of the month, from May to October, from 7pm. Tickets are $15 from Humanitix.com, door sales $20.\n\nThanks to Creative New Zealand for their generous support.",
