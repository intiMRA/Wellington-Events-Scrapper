Her latest Smooch EP, and appearance on the Big Fresh Collective\u2019s Footmahi compilation, show an emerging fun side to her dancefloor arsenal, following the murky weight of 2023\u2019s Everything\u2019s Perpetual. Donnys worldwide have heralded the new release as a \u201cfreshly cooked 3 course meal, served up by Palmy\u2019s premier snack pack herself\u201d. Think wonky hyperpop with plenty of low end.\n\nDiesel Jenny\u2019s (P\u014dneke\u2019s Josh Finegan) live set will blend brain-breaking breaks with sugar-rush synths and 3D club energy years.

    "description": "TICKETS: https://meow.flicket.co.nz/\nTHE SUPERJESUS - A long career in the music industry is much of a rarity these days but Adelaide rockers The Superjesus have managed to hold their place as one of Australia\u2019s most respected live bands for almost 30 years.\n\nEmerging in the late 90\u2019s and signing to Warners worldwide they released 3 classic albums, Sumo, Jet Age and Rock Music, two of which went platinum. The 3 x Aria award winners took a hiatus in the mid 2000\u2019s to work on solo projects and re-emerged in 2013 to test the waters. Pleased to have found themselves well received by the public they headed back into the studio for 2016\u2019s EP Love And Violence followed by a double live album.\n\nThe South Australian Music Hall Of Fame inductees have a strong work ethic and an ear for a good hook. With hits such as \u2018Gravity\u2019 , \u2018Secret Agent Man\u2019, \u2018Down Again\u2019 & \u2018Now And Then\u2019 under their belt their songwriting has always remained their strong point. It has been 20 years since The Superjesus have released a full-length album of new music. In 2025 the band released their first self-titled album \u2018The Superjesus\u2019. After 30 years of crafting their sound, the songwriting partnership of Sarah McLeod & Stuart Rudd has truly found its sweet spot.\n\nRudd say\u2019s \u201cour writing partnership together has blossomed into a fantastic place to be creative. McLeod backed this up with \u201cWhen you find a great creative writing partner, stick with it\u201d From the opening bars of \u2018Starlight\u2019 we hear classic TSJ, tipping the hat to the 90\u2019s sound they are known for while surging forward lyrically & melodically to create something really special.\n\nThis is the new Superjesus, a more soulful engaging version of the band we know and love where song writing is king. To date 5 singles have been released from the forthcoming self-titled album \u201cMoney (We\u2019re Only In It For Love), \u2018Lights Out\u2019, \u2018We Won\u2019t Let Go Until It\u2019s Over\u2019, \u2018Something Good\u2019 & a cover of Generation X\u2019s \u2018Dancing With Myself\u2019. All 5 singles have gained national airplay, setting the mood for this highly anticipated release.\n\nThey have kept the beautiful ballad \u2018Diamonds\u2019 to accompany the release. Here we see The Superjesus like never before, a beautiful emotive stirrer written on the piano showcasing how far the band has come musically, coupled with Sarah McLeod's classic rich vocals. The Superjesus are back stronger than ever and according to Rudd \u201cnot going anywhere anytime soon\u201d . McLeod said \u201cFor us the magic is in the creation of the music & as a band we have found this process very soul enriching, I truly feel it\u2019s our best work yet, I love every song on this record \u201d.\n\nSupporting TSJ on the NZ shows is NZ\u2019s THE AFTER.\nThe After are a pop/rock band blending moody grooves, gritty guitars & soaring melodies into emotionally charged soundscapes. Already two massive Asia Pacific tours under their belt, a string of NZ tours, significant airplay & video successes; The After are a well-oiled live act with a fast-growing international reputation. At the helm is the magnetic Ruby Fraser, whose powerhouse vocals and searing guitar work channel raw emotion & rebellious spirit. Founding member Andrew Featherstone lays the groundwork on bass with tight, tasteful songwriting. Behind the kit, Gareth Scott delivers versatile, thunderous rhythms, while Bruce Madden\u2014a true Hammond organ virtuoso\u2014elevates the band\u2019s sound with lush swells & soul-soaked textures rarely heard in modern pop/rock.\n\nSingles co-produced & mixed by Steve James (Screaming Jets, Sex Pistols), latest track \u201cMesmerised\u201d mastered by Leon Zervos (INXS, AC/DC, Pink). \u2022 \u2018Mesmerised\u2019 radio & TV in NZ & the Philippines \u2022 \u2018Clear to Me\u2019 (feat.

From his soulful early ballads and hard bop classics to the boundary-pushing spiritual intensity of his later free jazz works, this performance traces the full arc of Coltrane\u2019s musical journey.\n\n\n\nLed by drummer Oscar Garvie, the group is anchored by the expressive and deeply studied playing of saxophonist Isaac Randel, whose sound channels the fire and depth of Coltrane\u2019s voice. Randel brings a commanding front-line presence and a profound connection to the material, making him the perfect interpreter of Coltrane\u2019s vast and evolving musical language.\n\n\n\nThe band also features Jack Harris on bass and Tane Kelly on piano \u2014 a dynamic rhythm section that navigates the full emotional and sonic range of Coltrane\u2019s music.\n\n\n\nTogether, this quartet dives into every era of Coltrane\u2019s work \u2014 from the lyrical beauty of Naima and the modal mastery of Impressions, to the raw, transcendent fire of Ascension and Interstellar Space. This tribute isn\u2019t just a look back \u2014 it\u2019s a living, breathing expression of what Coltrane\u2019s music still means\n\nMusic from 9pm, FREE ENTRY"

    "description": "The next concert in our series presents a new project by Dave Wilson titled Free, Free: Meditations on Liberation. This project brings together a collective of musicians from across the music communities of P\u014dneke in an invitation to explore the expansive possibilities for what liberation might sound like.\n\nFree, Free draws from legacies of musical collectivity, and celebrates a commitment to both collaboration and the distinct expression of each individual.\n\nRanging from contemplative minimalism to ecstatic ensemble energy and body-moving grooves, the music of Free, Free invites musicians and other listeners to tend to each moment, making their own offerings to shape the collective sound.\n\nDave Wilson is a saxophonist, clarinettist, composer, producer, and interdisciplinary scholar. His music bridges avant-garde and experimental music with various groove-oriented styles from the worlds of jazz, R&B, electronic music, and more. With his 2023 album Ephemeral, described as \u201cquite spiritually intense music\u201d by The Guardian, he was a finalist for Te Manu Taki Tautito o te Tau | Best Jazz Artist at the Aotearoa Music Awards, and for the APRA Best Jazz Composition Award. Before relocating to Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington in 2016, Dave grew up in the Chicago area, lived for a decade in Los Angeles, and spent several stints living in Skopje, North Macedonia.\n\nFree, Free: Meditations on Liberation\nDave Wilson, Tyaan Singh \u2013 alto saxophone\nLouisa Williamson \u2013 tenor saxophone\nMonique Lapins, Mana Waiariki \u2013 violin\nKen Ichinose \u2013 cello\nKaito Walley, Natania Ngawhau \u2013 trombone\nBen Hunt \u2013 trumpet\nDaniel Hayles, Andrew Faleatua \u2013 piano and keyboard\nPhoebe Johnson \u2013 bass\nCallum Allardice \u2013 guitar\nHikurangi Schaverien-Kaa \u2013 drums\n\nThe performance will begin with an opening set by Flute Journeys, an offbeat mass flute ensemble with the self-described playing abilities of 5\u201312-year-olds, embodying a form of liberation in music.\n\nThe Jazz Orchestra Composer Series showcases original music for large jazz ensemble by New Zealand composers. Concerts take place every 1st and 3rd Friday of the month, from May to October, from 7pm. Tickets are $15, door sales $20.\n\nThanks to CNZ for their generous support. See less"

When? No-one knows!\n**This event also features the multi-faceted talents of 'Bottom Bunk Club' and 'The Rugs'\n***Doors will open by 8pm, and the performances will commence soon after!"

A few post-punk covers are thrown in for good measure, but their focus is on time-honoured song craft with a good measure of wit and wisdom.\n\nInterlopers are as yet unrecorded, but you can check out their little live music video of 'Bachelor Wine' for a wee taster..."

His voice too isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019d expect. More smooth, more pronounced, and more powerful than his rough exterior may evoke. Chris grew up in rural New Zealand and likes to tell tales about the little things, as those are what make our lives rich and full. He\u2019s mostly performed with award-winning indie-folk band Albi & The Wolves but has written songs in many different projects, including a collaboration with Mt Eden Dubstep that has amassed over one million streams, or his side project Sneakers which has a single with over 750,000 streams.\nWhether it\u2019s on the stage or off, Chris is known for his work ethic and as he sets out on a new journey, quietly creating new solo music, he\u2019s excited to see where that leads. For this show, Chris will be joined by the accomplished musician Hannah Morrell on the violin and maybe even the banjo. She is a seasoned touring musician who hails from Tasmania, Australia and has performed with the likes of The Dead Maggies (TAS), Claire Anne Taylor (TAS), Looking For Alaska, Finn Johanson, Holly Arrowsmith, and Jess Bailey (Fables).\nNot for profit, supporting our dedicated musicians.

Princess Chelsea\u2019s Midwinter Ball returns, this year with a new theme: SWORDS AND SORCERY - Fantasy on The Big Screen. With your esteemed host comedian Tom Sainsbury, and live performances from Princess Chelsea & The Dream Warriors in both centres, with Auckland guests The Circling Sun & Golden Axe, while Wellington will be treated to sets from Grecco Romank & Luke Buda.\n\nIn the shimmering and VHS-heavy age of the early 1980s, a treasure trove of cinematic fantasy was thrust upon us. Gleaming swords and potent spells in Excalibur, the ethereal beauty and terror of Legend, valiant quests of The Sword and The Sorcerer, Ladyhawke, The Beastmaster, Willow, Dragonslayer, and the mighty & muscular quests of Conan The Barbarian. And let us not forget the timeless enchantments of pure fantasy with The Neverending Story, the delightful Princess Bride, the poignant Last Unicorn, and the unforgettable shape of Labyrinth.\n\nSo, brave adventurers, will you join us to celebrate this golden age? How will you dress to impress as visions of enchanted lands and heroic feats conjure a costume fit for fantasy?\n\nCalled by many as \u2018the show of 2024\u2019, last year\u2019s Twin Peaks themed Midwinter Ball was a revelation, and a dress up party for the ages. A sold out Wintergarden heaved with 650 guests dressed as Log Ladies, Agent Dale Coopers, and even a giant slice of cherry pie\u2026 and oh, so much more.\n\nPrincess Chelsea and her band The Dream Warriors delighted the audience with a blazing set of originals alongside covers of Julee Cruise, Angelo Badalamenti and In Heaven from Lynch\u2019s Eraserhead. This wild and unforgettable night has been lovingly captured and presented as a four song tribute to David Lynch, due for imminent release.\nFor 2024\u2019s Twin Peaks-themed ball, no expenses were spared on transforming the venue into the quaint town of Twin Peaks. Decoration which featured lasers, an indoor pine forest, a shrine to Laura Palmer and a replica of the infamous Red Room, we can only expect magic and mystery from 2025\u2019s fantasy- themed ball.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving too much away but obviously we will need a medieval sword fight\u201d - Princess Chelsea\n\nIf last year\u2019s ball was anything to go by, I don't think she is joking - and further shenanigans will undoubtedly ensue. Expect the Civic and Meow Nui to be transformed into a world of fantasy.\n\nEarlybird tickets are on sale Friday at 10am. Book your evening, and swan down the red carpet dressed in your favourite fantasy-inspired outfits. Portraits will be taken on the night, and prizes for best dressed."

Monaghan responds in real time, creating a feedback loop between human, organism, and machine.\n\nTheir debut album, GUEST, was recorded during the 2024 Sonic Artist Residency (Creative New Zealand / NZSM / Toi P\u014dneke) and emerged through open-ended, intuitive sessions. A diverse group of collaborators was invited to join the process, including Kedron Parker, Nico Buhne, Bill Wood, Ruby Solly, Indigique Brown, David Long, Andrew Faleatua, Andy Wright, Gemma Thompson, Timothy Morel, Mo H. Zareei, Tae Kyung Seo, Issac Smith, and Chrissie Butler.\nRather than guiding the music, contributors were invited to follow it\u2014adding their voices to a living, shifting ecology of sound. The result is an album that is rhythmic, irregular, immersive, and alive.\n\nGUEST is co-released by Audio Foundation Records (T\u0101maki Makaurau) and skirted Records (Te Whanganui-a-Tara).\n\nKIERAN MONAGHAN\nKieran Monaghan is a self-taught multi-instrumentalist, writer, recording artist and sound bogan based in Te Whanganui-A-Tara.

    "description": "Wellington\u2019s iconic Old St Paul\u2019s (OSP) will play host to a transcendent new series in August, partnering with the Pyramid Club to present Altared States, a unique electronic music experience. Set beneath the exquisite stained-glass windows of one of Te Whanganui-a-Tara\u2019s most exquisite landmarks, this series promises an immersive sonic experience that invites audiences to explore sound in a deeply personal and transformative way.\n\nAltared States is inspired by Brian Sweeney\u2019s New York-founded Ambient Church, an initiative dedicated to collaborating with artists to create transformative audio performances in architecturally significant spaces. This series will immerse attendees in soundscapes that transcend the ordinary, offering a chance to disconnect for a moment from the modern world.\n\nEach of the evenings will bring a different electronic vibe, conjured by some of Wellington\u2019s most innovative artists. The series lineup includes:\n\nAugust 1: Ludus\nAugust 8: Stephen Gallagher with David Long and Jules Desmond\nAugust 15: Oghum\nAugust 22: Dream Chambers\n\nSet within the chancel at the altar of the venue, each artist will perform a 60-minute immersive sound experience that redefines ritual in a contemporary light.\n\nTickets are available now, with limited capacity of 50 for each show of this intimate series.\n\nAbout the Artists\n\nLudus\n\nis the captivating musical venture curated by Emma Bernard. Her creative inspiration spans across the worlds of electronic music, audio engineering, sound design, and the written word. Bernard\u2019s artistic journey explores the deep connection between soundscapes and the natural world, with a focus on evoking emotional responses to the environments we inhabit. She is also co-founder of the P\u014dneke-based collective Tonic.\n\nStephen Gallagher\n\nis an Emmy award-winning composer and music editor who has worked on an extensive range of projects, from global blockbusters to television and contemporary dance. Most recently, he completed the score for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Gallagher\u2019s work spans collaborations with Peter Jackson, Brian Eno, Ed Sheeran, Nick Cave, and many more.\n\nDavid Long\n\nis a composer, performer, founding member of The Mutton Birds, and member of easy listening noise band, Teeth. His career has spanned over 40 years and seen him work on numerous projects to commercial and critical acclaim. In his own words he likes to \u201cmash shit up\u201d, creating orchestral scores that utilise \u201cnot only classical instruments but all sorts of things\u201d.\n\nJules Desmond\n\nis an experimental musician from Wellington who has played in bands including Letterbox Lambs, 1/3 Octave Band, Bachelor of Architecture and Black Boned Angel.\n\nOghum\n\nis the interstellar duo of Nell Thomas (Orchestra of Spheres, Cookie Brooklyn and the Crumbs) and Jonny Marks (All Seeing Hand, Mean Bones), performing on Synthi AKS, theremin and other assorted items. Oghum blends electronic sounds from times past with an array of acoustic and found sounds, using nuanced improvisation to create detailed and tangible sonic environments, invoking memory and transporting the listener through narrow gaps into wide open otherworldly spaces.\n\nJess Chambers\n\nis a composer, musician, and educator currently based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and working under the moniker Dream Chambers. From her beginnings as a folk singer to her current explorations in electronic music, she experiments with sound as a practice of attention: to a room, an outer world, an inner feeling. It\u2019s in that space of beholding where transformation and connection occur, and Chambers is a master alchemist, likening that stretch of attention in music to growing a garden: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of searching, reaching and eventual blossoming in my music \u2013 it feels like coming up from underground, like a tulip bulb.\u201d\n\nAbout the Venue\n\nBuilt in 1866, Old St Paul\u2019s is a prime example of timber Gothic Revival architecture and one of Aotearoa\u2019s most important historic places. Managed and operated by Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, it is a venue steeped in history and beauty.\n\nThe Pyramid Club, located on Taranaki Street, is an artist-run space dedicated to experimental music and sonic arts, providing a home for innovative sound exploration."

    "description": "Indie-folk artist Ben Chavasse is making his first trip to Wellington to celebrate the release of his first two singles. This set will feature stripped back arrangements of his songs accompanied with string arrangements performed by Karen Hu (cello), and Hijiri Yamamoto (violin).\n\nBen Chavasse is a 26-year-old singer-songwriter based in T\u0101maki Makaurau. His lyric-forward approach embraces the indie-folk genre while incorporating rock, punk, and jazz influences. He explores themes of adolescence, mental health, and reconciliation through an introspective, reflective and vulnerable lens. Ben continues to thrive in collaboration with local musicians he met during his studies at the University of Auckland Jazz School.\n\nBronwyn Wilde grew up across the road from Vogelmorn and can remember performing at the Hall as early as age six (she sang the national anthem at the Ridgway school talent quest - it was not a winning song choice). Today, she is a trustee of the Vogelmorn Community Group and occasionally works behind the bar, where she has been lucky to see so many talented local musicians perform.\nShe has many fond memories of singing with Ben together in their flat in Auckland during the 2021 lockdown. She is thrilled to be joining him on stage at Vogelmorn, her second home."

Carol Bean \u2013 vocals and guitar, Costa Botes \u2013 guitar(s), George Packard \u2013 upright bass, and Andrew Grayson \u2013 drums.\nEnglish-born, California-raised, Carol was influenced by the West Coast music of the 60s and the blues of Mississippi John Hurt, Mance Lipscomb, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, and Doc Watson. At LA\u2019s Ash Grove and McCabe\u2019s Music Store she was taught her picking style from a young Ry Cooder who encouraged her to buy the Martin guitar she still plays today. Carol has fronted several bands in New Zealand and recorded 3 studio albums, all on Spotify. She continues to perform at the Wellington Roomfulla Blues Club and with the Kelburn Viaduct Municipal Ensemble Jug Band.\nCarol\u2019s singing is versatile, vibrant, and delivers an earthy quality to her songs. Tom Villano, LA\n\u2026 when the mood drops she reveals a more intimate, reflective side\u2026. Graham Reid\nThe first three songs of Next Bus Out perfectly set the album up for the interesting journey that is to come. Nick Bollinger.\nCosta is a veteran independent filmmaker with several award winning short films and feature length documentaries to his credit, including the notorious \u2018mock doc\u2019 Forgotten Silver, which he made with Peter Jackson. For the last two decades he has created a run of films celebrating individuals who are quirky, creative, passionate, and above all, persistent (Struggle No More, The Last Dogs of Winter, Act of Kindness, Angie, When The Cows Come Home). These films have included studies of musicians (Paddy Burgin's Wooden Box Band, Nigel Gavin\u2019s Circus, and The Shot Band/ Hobnails @ The Paramount Theatre) because Costa has been a persistent closet musician himself. He has had stints with Chris and Eva Prowse, and Carol Bean's Mount Misery String Band. When he was younger, Costa wanted to move his fingers really fast. Now he just tries to put them in the right place, song by song, and man - does he ever. \u201cTasty\u201d, \u201cAmazing\u201d, \u201cGreat playing\u201d.\nCosta Botes | NZ On Screen & Costa Botes Lone Pine Films (vimeo.com)\nGeorge is a professional musician and tutor on Whitireia Polytechnic\u2019s Music Programme, trained classically on the cello. George\u2019s first improvisational experiences were playing ukulele along with the Rolling Stones, John Mayall and The Band (in his bedroom). With little market for improvisational ukulele he took up the double bass.\nGeorge enjoys playing in bands that push the envelope and give expression to the human soul. He has played extensively in many Wellington groups (including currently with the Rag Poets band), appearing a number of times for the Wellington International Festival of the Arts, undertaking national tours for Chamber Music New Zealand, and backing overseas artists in New Zealand. His playing ranges from classical to jazz, to Latin, to ethnic fusion to Americana and country. He believes - at a fundamental level - that music is about human beings making sense of the world and themselves, and about helping heal the world.\nAndrew is also the drummer for the band Ghostplane (Beneath the Sleepy Lagoon; Panther Valley Country Club (Arch Hill Records), which includes Phoenix Foundation members). Not only has he joined our team, but his passion is surfing - so let's say he's the youngest and the fittest.\nNot for profit, supporting our dedicated musicians. Suggested donation $30\nCome along and enjoy this gig in our special space, up close and personal.\nTeas, Coffee and Snacks provided. You're welcome to bring anything you'd like to eat or drink.\nParking available in the Coupon zones of Upland Rd & Glasgow St free after 6pm weekdays, and free all through the weekends.

Her last album \u2018Tug of War\u2019 included the pivotal release of the 2022 APRA NZ Best Country Song \u2018Trouble Finds a Girl\u2019 and was described by Rolling Stone as an album, \u201cworthy of every award it will inevitably collect.\u201d\n\nNo stranger to the road, Jenny was recently awarded a scholarship to perform at Nashville\u2019s iconic AmericanaFest and has toured Australia and New Zealand extensively over the last decade - supporting artists including Fanny Lumsden (AU), Tami Neilson (NZ) and Nadia Reid (NZ) along the way. Her most recent touring project, The Bush & the Birds Tour, travelled throughout NZ in support of conservation organisation; Forest & Bird. An ode to her late Grandfather\u2019s love of the land, the tour generated over $2000 in donations for Forest & Bird.\n\nJenny grew up in a home and family of music and often tours with her sisters, The Mitchell Twins, and country music loving Dad, Ron Mitchell. After growing up with a musical diet of The Chicks, Hank Williams and Dolly Parton, Jenny penned her first songs at the age of 11 after a trip to Ireland where she connected with her Irish heritage and explored the immigration story of her Irish born Grandparents. A few years down the track, Jenny performed original work on the TV show New Zealand's Got Talent, was placed 3rd and went onto crowdfund and release her first album at the age of 15. In 2017, she was crowned the overall winner of the NZ Gold Guitar Awards which kickstarted the professional chapter of her career, leading to her Aotearoa Music Award Winning album 'Wildfires\u2019 produced by Tasmania\u2019s Matt Fell.\n\nWith a sound that No Depression describes as, \u201cpoetry that dominates a beautiful melody,\u201d Jenny Mitchell is comfortable with a country twang or softly spoken ballad and is rapidly capturing fans across the globe."

    "description": "Ready to take these new tracks on the road, The Grogans new album Stagger is\nout, plus the band are excited to announce a headline tour across New Zealand.\nExploring another side of The Grogans' music, Stagger is a patchwork of different\nsounds and sonic inspirations that all come together in the one album, it came\nfrom this idea that it was a jagged and stylistically different album track to\ntrack, explain The Grogans.\nKicking off their tour at Loons in Christchurch on Wednesday 3 September, the\nband then head to Yonder in Queenstown on Thursday 4 September, San Fran in\nWellington on Friday 5 September before wrapping up at Double Whammy\nAuckland on Saturday 6 September. Prior to their Aotearoa dates, the trio will also\nbe playing a seven date tour throughout Australia along with stops in LA and New\nYork for North American shows this June.\n\nCapturing the magnetic energy of their live shows, Stagger touches on themes of\nmental health, taking care of yourself and your loved ones, the occasional love song,\nand more. As the catchy chorus first single and album opener \u2018Oh Boy\u2019 leads into\nsonic powerhouse of a tune \u2018Come Up (Goes Down)\u2019, \u2018In My Heart\u2019 slows it down to\na new easy listening direction, followed by \u2018Have a Little Dream\u2019 - as dreamy as the\ntitle suggests - and the big open echoed instrumentation of \u2018Once In A While\u2019.\nAdding new textural effects in \u2018Roll Back\u2019 and last single \u2018Roundabout\u2019, \u2018Happier\nMan\u2019 dips into a heavier psych realm with a reminder that striving to be a better\nand happier person should be a goal for everyone. \u2018Worry About Everything\u2019\nis an upbeat tune sure to have you worrying about nothing, and feel good album\ncloser \u2018All My Days\u2019 ends on a more serious note that outlines the beauty and the\nbeast of live music and the personal struggles that come with the lifestyle and\ntouring.\n\nMixing on the road definitely added something different to this album.\nUsually, I\u2019m in the same spot whilst mixing and can come and go from each\ntrack mentally, but this time the album was attached to us at the hip. We would\nbring a set up through most of America and record/mix in green rooms and on\nthe bandwagon. It was definitely worth it, as we had to work with what we had\nto finish the album. Only being able to reference mixes on headphones and\nJBL speakers towards the end of the album process was definitely harder than\nin a studio. However, as a band, we have never really been able to sit still, so it\nworked nicely. Each mix has its own personality, and I guess that\u2019s what we\nwanted for this staggered album. - The Grogan\u2019s Quin Grunden on mixing and\nengineering the album on the road across the US & Canada through June-July 2024.\n\nStream Stagger Album: https://thegrogans.lnk.to/stagger\n\nIncluded in Rolling Stone\u2019s Future of Music 2025 and described by triple j as 'one\nof the most consistently hardworking live acts in the country\u2019, The Grogans\ncommitment to making incredibly varied, distinct music, sharing good experiences at\ntheir live show and genuine elation on playing together is clear to see and explains\nwhy they are one of Australia\u2019s brightest bands. In recent years, they have delighted\ntheir international fans with a headline 2024 tour across Europe, Ireland, and the UK,\na stop at the Netherlands\u2019 Misty Fields Festival, joining Ocean Alley on their North\nAmerican Summer Tour, and more. Never ones for slowing down, 2024 was filled\nwith local shows, sharing the stage with Teen Jesus and The Jean Teasers for their\n\u2018Fix It With Salt\u2019 tour, and a 5th anniversary tour of their LP \u2018Just What You Want.\n\nTickets for all dates go on sale Wednesday 28 May at midday."

    "description": "Hailing from the music-filled streets of Melbourne, Australia, Shaun Kirk is an award-winning blues and soul troubadour recognized for his exceptional talent as a born entertainer. His unique talent has not only earned him many accolades but also much praise from fellow artists, such as three-time Grammy Award Winner Fantastic Negrito, who has declared his show as One of the best one-man shows he\u2019s ever seen!\n\nKirk's vocals exude a gritty, soulful depth that seems to transcend far beyond his years, with critics continually acclaiming him as one of the finest blues voices Australia has ever heard (Buzz Mag). Complementing his vocal artistry, Kirk's vintage guitar tones and raw grooves pay tribute to the timeless influences that have shaped his musical journey, resulting in a distinctive sound fast becoming his own.\n\nShaun\u2019s musical journey has taken him to stages all over the world, where he's not only performed but consistently sold out shows, leaving audiences enthralled by his magnetic presence.

Now sixteen years into an extraordinary career, it seems our heroine has fully accepted her mantle as one of the world\u2019s great rock stars, fronting her gothic-tinged new outfit to widespread awe and acclaim, Devra Hoff on bass guitar and backing vocals, Teeny Lieberson on keys, guitar, and backing vocals, and Jorge Balbi on drums.\n\n\u201cThe Attachment Theory are a tight unit, woven together by Devra Hoff\u2019s inventive, intelligent bass lines... this show was less about [Sharon\u2019s] past and more about her future, which appears to lie with The Attachment Theory - a band who, on this evidence, are bringing the very best out of her.\u201d \u2013 Manchester Evening News\n\nAlso performing at The Others Way, and playing support in Wellington and Christchurch, American songwriter Shannon Lay is much of a punk as she is a folk singer, citing both The Ramones and Nick Drake as influences. As a member of garage rocker Ty Segall\u2019s Freedom Band, Lay can certainly make a racket, but for these shows, she will be opening as a solo act. The Guardian were quick to assure us that \u201cThis is no mere indie-folk musician,\u201d and Pitchfork said her most recent studio album \u201cpresents a quiet, lovely, undramatic rendering of the dramatic\u201d.\n\nWe truly could not be more excited to be welcoming Queen Shazza back to Aotearoa for these shows, and with the addition of both her band The Attachment Theory and Shannon Lay\u2019s opening spot, you should be dang well excited too!\n\n\u201cSharon Van Etten and The Attachment Theory\u2019s self-titled record is an early Album of the Year contender\u201d - www.independent.co.uk"

    "description": "Valhalla Touring are proud to announce direct from Canada, one of the worlds most brutal Death Metal bands, the mighty CRYPTOPSY, headlining 2 shows to close out the year of 2025, on their ALL SO VILE tour!!!\n\nMore than 30 years into their storied career, Montreal Death Metal innovators Cryptopsy return with their ninth studio album, An Insatiable Violence, set for release on June 20, 2025 on Season of Mist.\n\nRevered in extreme Metal circles for such groundbreaking classics as 1994\u2019s Blasphemy Made Flesh and the 1996 magnum opus None So Vile, Cryptopsy find yet another gear on An Insatiable Violence, which further solidifies the band\u2019s place in the upper echelon of Death Metal.\n\nComing out of the pandemic, the band dedicated themselves to staying on top of their game more than ever before, with the intention of consistently putting out a new record every two years. That started with 2023\u2019s acclaimed As Gomorrah Burns, which WON them a CANADIAN GRAMMY, and continues 21 months later with An Insatiable Violence.\n\nCRYPTOPSY will destroy December 2025 in Auckland/Tamaki Makaurau and Wellington/Te Whanganui-a-Tara"
