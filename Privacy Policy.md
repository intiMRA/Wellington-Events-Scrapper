**Last Updated:** July 11, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how What's On Welly ("we," "our," or "us") handles information when you use our mobile application, "What's On Welly" (the "App").

**We want to be absolutely clear: What's On Welly does not collect, store, or transmit any information about you, personal or otherwise.** No login is required to use the App, and we do not ask for your name, email address, location, device information, usage data, IP address, or any other data.

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

What's On Welly is designed to provide event information without collecting any data from its users. Specifically, we do not collect:

* **Account Information:** No user accounts are created or managed by the App.

* **Location Data:** We do not collect or track your precise or approximate location.

* **User-Provided Content:** We do not collect any content you might generate within the App, as there are no features for user input beyond basic searches or preferences that are processed locally on your device.

* **Device Information:** We do not collect information about your device, such as hardware model, operating system version, or unique device identifiers.

* **Usage Data:** We do not collect data on how you interact with the App, such as features used, events viewed, or how often the App is opened.

* **IP Address:** Your device's IP address is not collected or stored by us.

### 2. How We Handle Information

Since we do not collect any information, there is no data for us to use, analyse, or share. The App functions by accessing publicly available event data directly from external sources.

### 3. How We Share Information

As we do not collect any information, we do not share any data (personal or otherwise) with third parties.

### 4. Data Retention

Since we do not collect any information, there is no data to retain.

### 5. Your Choices and Rights

Since we do not collect any information, there is no data for you to access, update, or delete from our systems.

* **Notifications:** If the App offers push notifications, you can manage these directly through your device's operating system settings.

* **Device Permissions:** You can manage any device permissions (e.g., network access, if applicable for fetching public event data) through your device settings.

### 6. Security

Since we do not collect any information, there is no user data for us to secure. The App operates without handling sensitive user information on our systems.
