  "description": "Calligratherapy - Beginners\nMany of us live sedentary lifestyles, sitting for up to eight hours or more a day hunched over our keyboard - all the while rarely taking a proper breath! Even if we wanted to take a deep enriching breath into the lower lobes of our lungs, we are limited due to our posture. Often due to the stresses and strains of a busy work and life balance, our unconscious brain can develop a pattern of holding, irregular and shadow breaths.\nDoes this sound like your experience? \nNot being able to breathe properly is the key cause of many chronic respiratory diseases (Nestor, 2020)\nCalligratherapy combines science journalist James Nestor's theory on proper breathing with the philosophy of ancient Chinese calligraphy to promote a state of optimal wellbeing.\nCalligratherapy has been developed specifically for those who have never practiced calligraphy before and who are interested in deriving the benefits without having to learn the language or all the characters. It integrates the simple and intuitive act of inhaling and exhaling into calligraphy practice with Eastern philosophy behind it.\nA range of different breathing exercises are embedded into each 90 minute session focusing on different calligraphy scripts.  Over the five weeks, you will develop and practice the awareness of healthy breathing, while learning new techniques of Chinese soft brush calligraphy covering five different scripts. \nAll materials included in course fee.\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:\nStart a new creative practice in Chinese soft brush calligraphy\nDevelop your own mindfulness strategy\nBetter manage everyday stress levels and access a calm, empowered and positive state of mind\nFind ways to explore eastern philosophy and develop deeper connections with your spiritual self. \nNote:  Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

Creatives often feel imposter syndrome most acutely. Unlike other industries, those in the creative field produce something new every time, and sharing this with the world can be daunting, even for established artists.\n This pervasive self-doubt, known as imposter syndrome, affects countless artists and creators, often holding them back from realising their full potential. This concise workshop is designed to help you uncover the roots of this inner voice of insecurity and provide you with effective tools to overcome it. Through engaging activities and practical exercises, you will learn how to transform self-doubt into a source of strength, empowering you to confidently share your unique talents with the world.\n What you won't find in this masterclass: This is not a session about general self-growth or self-confidence, and it does not include positive affirmations or self-talk. All the information provided is based on scientific research and is applicable to all creative sectors.\nBring along some examples of your work on the day (eg a painting, a photograph of your work, etc).\n By the end of this workshop, you\u2019ll be able to: \nIdentify and challenge the origins of your imposter syndrome.\nApply practical techniques to silence your inner critic.\nShare your creative work with increased confidence.\nTurn self-doubt into a motivational tool.\nRecognise and celebrate your achievements as a creative professional.\nCourses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

They also confirmed, New Zealand Superannuation is not sufficient to fund the retirement most people want.\nMinistry of Social Development (2020):\n22% of all people receiving New Zealand Superannuation also receive additional support payments, with over 44,000 superannuants receiving additional accommodation support,\nAnd if you needed to obtain Government assisted accommodation, at the end of March 2020, more than 16,300 households were waiting for state or social housing.\nLiving in a motel or boarding house with strangers (who may have other vulnerable backgrounds) is not an ideal or safe location to spend your retirement years.   But for many, it is the only option they can afford.\nIf you have not planned for your retirement, then this course is you! \nThis course has been developed for people in their 50\u2019s or 60\u2019s that are looking at retirement and have no idea if they can financially survive it: what to do, what $\u2019s they need, how or where they can generate additional income, or even where to go to get help. \nIt is targeted towards those that still have some time (for some - not much) to make adjustments, learn some basic financial skills, make some big decisions, and positively influence the quality of their pending retirement. \nYou will be introduced to a simple step by step guide to developing a financial plan for retirement. \nYou will work though a case study in class, and can then go away and repeat the process with your own data/details.  You will be provided with comprehensive course notes to enable you to update the case study information with your own information. \nAt each step, key considerations and financial concepts will be defined, explained and discussed to help you understand the financial requirements of retirement.  \nAre you ready for the retirement lifestyle you hoped or dreamed of?  If not, then this course is for you.\n[A condition of enrolment is that you must provide photo ID when you attend.\nDisclaimer:  The tutors are not financial advisors.  No investments, products nor specific recommendations will be provided.  A step by step planning process will be taught by working through a case study.  Key considerations that should be used by the participants when looking at their own options to bridge the financial gap between what is available through superannuation and what is required to meet lifestyle goals will be provided and discussed.  Product names may be used in examples and explanations to help participants understand the financial concepts and the planning process.\nNote:  Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.

  "description": "Social Media Marketing for Small Enterprises: Visual Impact\nWhether you are just starting out or already running a business, having an online and social media presence is essential. While most of us know in theory that we need a marketing plan, a social media strategy, a consistent post schedule, and engaging reels for TikTok, the reality is that every business is unique, and your approach should reflect that.\n One constant across all online presences is the importance of visuals\u2014photographs, images, and graphics. With attention spans shorter than ever, your audience will move on within seconds if they are not engaged\u2014they see images first and then only start reading the text. If you can't captivate their attention, you risk losing potential customers. Generic and overused stock images, or AI-generated visuals, can do more harm than good, even if they seem like an affordable option.\n In this course, we will explore different types of content suitable for your specific needs and audiences, how to create it or where to source it, how to develop the right visual strategy for your online presence, what tools to use, and how to implement it immediately. By the end of the course, you will have an outstanding online presence.\nA condition of enrolment is that you must provide photo id when you attend the workshop.\n By the end of the four-week course, you\u2019ll be able to:\n Recognise the critical role of visuals in social media marketing.\nChoose the most effective type of visual content for your brand.\nProduce high-quality, engaging visuals using various tools and techniques.\nImplement a cohesive visual strategy across multiple social media platforms.\nAssess and refine your visual strategy to maximise engagement and build trust with your audience.\nNote:  Courses need a minimum number to go ahead so if we don't have enough enrolments a few days before the start date, we have to cancel.
