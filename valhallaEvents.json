Armed with new releases and a reckless lack of MIDI cables, longtime pals Synthetic Children and Diesel Jenny are packing gear into the whip for a trip up and down the motu.\nVia hardware synths and drum machines, Synthetic Children (Te Papaioea\u2019s Celina Goacher) is bringing bubbly synths, auto-tuned vulnerabilities, and sub-rattling beats. \nDiesel Jenny\u2019s (P\u014dneke\u2019s Josh Finegan) live set will blend brain-breaking breaks with sugar-rush synths and 3D club energy years. This tour will celebrate the inaugural release of Diesel Jenny\u2019s white label series with a rock-solid RUC-exempt two-tracker.\nEkho Laliah is an Aotearoa based artist who stitches together elements of dream pop, freak folk, and ethereal electronica into sonic tapestries with experimental production as the backbone.\nTickets $15 through UTR or $20 at the door"
