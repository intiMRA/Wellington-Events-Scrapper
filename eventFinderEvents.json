Both these structural approaches contribute greatly to the success of your drawing.\n\nGeometric shapes can simplifying a subject, unify a drawing and make compositions dynamic. Geometric solids will help render any subject in three dimensions and transition to perspective.\n\nA good working knowledge of the concepts of perspective will help you draw any subject with correct dimensionality. It can also help in your realist drawing, painting and invented subjects and environments. These concepts are also used in most two dimensional art because it enables us to realise great spatial effects, making it an invaluable tool to add to your skill set."

They both love answering questions about space and looking at the stars at night with really large telescopes (make sure you check their Star Safari experience too).\n\nHari and Sam have logged an impressive over 200 school and event visits with the Mars Blueberry since they started in 2022 and have hosted more than 38,000 people through the airlock of the Blueberry.\n\nEach session is a 20-minute live voyage through the universe.

You will be humbly implored not to form an impression of Raybon from this experience."

It starts on Wed 13 August and runs until Wed 17 September, 5.30pm-8pm.\n\nLevel one: Students learn carving in hard wax, texture forming in soft wax, and how to clean up and finish your metal pieces. Course costs include basic materials for the process, but do not include the eventual metal costs for the pieces you choose to cast. As this is subject to each students' choice of size and type of metal, we leave this up to you to decide.\n\nCastings may cost between $5 and $40 depending on whether you cast in Silver or Bronze. Casting in Bronze or Brass will be much cheaper.\n\nLevel two: expand your range of designs and skills with the wax you prefer using. Learn to set stones into your designs and either: Cast them IN the metal (exciting and organic) or, more advanced students can learn to set them in a fabrication class.\n\nClasses fill fast so please book now to reserve your place!"

Released in 1977, the album defined a disco generation. Tribute act Best of the Bee Gees Saturday Night Fever and the George Ellis Orchestra come to The Opera House in August 2025. They\u2019ll play chart-busters from that album plus songs from other bands from the 70s like K.C. & The Sunshine Band, and The Trammps. Special guests Debora McLane (niece of the Bee Gees) and Roslyn Loxton join the tribute band on stage.\n\nIn a two-act orchestrated performance, you\u2019ll hear some of the best songs written by the Gibb brothers. Groove along to tracks like You Should Be Dancing, Stayin\u2019 Alive, Jive Talkin\u2019, Disco Inferno, More Than A Woman, Warm Ride, and so much more.\n\nThe album \u2018Saturday Night Fever\u2019 was the biggest-selling sound recording between 1977 and 1980. It was awarded Album of the Year at the 1979 Grammys and stayed in the Top 200 for 29 consecutive months. It made Barry Gibb the first solo songwriter in history to have three consecutive number ones, and four songs in the top ten simultaneously."

(NZ citizen and residents free with ID, all others pay $109).\n\nIn your middle years, working, retired or somewhere in between? What\u2019s next? Life is about much more than work or leisure, but most of us have given little thought to what \u201cretirement\u201d might mean.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to speculate what may happen in the future \u2013 but we can be proactive and take control.\nThis course offers insights into how to make the most of our time once we\u2019re less focused on career and/or childrearing. It covers many of the issues people face when considering a move from current employment to a different lifestyle that includes more time to do the things we\u2019ve always promised ourselves we\u2019d do \u2013 \u201cwhen we retire\u201d.\n\nAfter the workshop, you\u2019ll be able to identify a number of common issues and potential ways to manage them when considering and planning your \u201crejuvenation\u201d, rather than a retirement. We won\u2019t cover financial planning, but will focus on some of the personal growth opportunities for living and making a conscious contribution to your community.\n\nBy the end of the day, you\u2019ll have:\n- Developed your own perspective on ageing and retirement in the 21st Century and identified what\u2019s important to you\n- Completed a personal life audit exercise and considered your strengths\n- Explored possibilities in the major aspects of your life and identified potential challenges and strategies for overcoming them\n- Developed a blueprint to maximise the best years of your life and developed a \u201cfuture proofing\u201d downsizing plan\n- Considered options to include a sense of purpose and explored and implemented choices that provide you with that sense of purpose\nBring a pen and paper.\n\n1 day, Sat 9:30 AM \u2013 4:00 PM\nWellington High School\nPresented by Angela Robertson"

Written by band members Tess Luff, Elena Saunders and Ellie Stewart, this group of talented musicians invite you into contemplative corners of their brains with a set of gentle and jovial numbers that will entertain and delight.\n\nThey will be joined on stage by their friends the Bidibids.\n\n\nAbout Hihi & The Stitchbirds:\n\nHihi & The Stitchbirds are an exciting five-piece musical experiment, based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Pairing rich vocal harmonies with vibrant original music inspired by the folk and Americana playbooks, this band brings something for everyone.\n\nHihi & The Stitchbirds are:\n\n\nElena Saunders - vocals and vibes\n\nChris Goldsbury - guitar, clarinet and vocals\n\nTess Luff - guitar, banjo uke and vocals\n\nMatt Hutton - bass uke and vocals\n\nEllie Stewart - fiddle and vocals\n\n\nAbout the Bidibids:\n\nWith lush harmonies, intricate arrangements, and beguiling melodies, the Bidibids explore what it means to play folk music in New Zealand. The Bidibids are Sarah August on banjo and guitar, Simon Carryer on cello-banjo, and Brendan Schenk on mandolin and guitar. The trio came together at the 2020 Wellington Folk Festival, where they were each supposed to be playing in different groups. Since then, the Wellington-based band have become regulars at some of the region\u2019s best venues for folk music, including the Mussel Inn, Moon, and the Wellington Bluegrass Society.\n\nDriven by Sarah\u2019s honest, intimate songwriting and Brendan\u2019s blazing musicianship, the Bidibids balance soulful ballads that will tug your heart-strings with upbeat numbers which will get your toes tapping. Influenced by American bluegrass and folk bands like Watchhouse and Nickel Creek, they\u2019re also inspired by local acts like the Eastern and Marlon Williams who are forging an authentic New Zealand folk tradition.

It involves using exercises to optimize energy within the body, mind, and spirit, with the goal of improving and maintaining health and well-being.\n\nQigong has both psychological and physical components and involves the regulation of the mind, breath, and body\u2019s movement and posture.\n\nIn most forms of qigong:\n\nBreath is slow, long, and deep. Breath patterns may switch from abdominal breathing to breathing combined with speech sounds.\nMovements are typically gentle and smooth, aimed for relaxation.\nMind regulation includes focusing one\u2019s attention and visualization.\nDynamic (active) qigong techniques primarily focus on body movements, especially movements of the whole body or arms and legs. Meditative (passive) qigong techniques can be practiced in any posture that can be maintained over time and involve breath and mind exercises, with almost no body movement.\nWear loose, comfortable clothing and bring a bottle of water.\n\n[This is a physical activity that involves an element of risk. While all possible measures are taken to prevent accidents or injury, please note that participation is at your own risk].\n\nDuration 6 weeks"

    "description": "Back after a sold-out season during the 2025 Wellington Pride Festival!\n\nHeritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, Katherine Mansfield House & Garden, and Vixen Temple present The Magic of Her Body: Readings of Katherine Mansfield\u2019s Queer Writing, an immersive theatrical experience in one of Aotearoa\u2019s leading historic house museums.\n\nJoin performance artist Vixen Temple and historian Kerryn Pollock of Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga on a journey through Mansfield\u2019s sensual diary entries and sapphic-coded short stories, moving through the rooms in the home of her birth, Katherine Mansfield House & Garden in Thorndon. Live musical accompaniment will be performed by Ms Weeds.\n\nThe Wednesday performance will be followed by a Q&A session.\n\nKatherine Mansfield (1888-1923) is one of Aotearoa\u2019s most internationally acclaimed writers. Born in Wellington, she lived permanently in England and Europe from 1908 until her untimely death from tuberculosis in 1923. She became a central figure in literary modernism alongside contemporaries such as Virginia Woolf and DH Lawrence. In the words of biographer Gill Boddy, \u2018She sought to capture the transitory vividness of life and to bring ordinary moments and people into focus so that their full significance could be understood\u2019. Her passionate diary entries, beginning when she was a teenager, reveal a sapphic sensibility and identity that carried over into her fiction. Mansfield is a messy, relatable teen, a literary diva, and queer icon whose voice speaks to us beyond time.\n\n\"The evening\u2019s structure flows beautifully: a mix of Mansfield\u2019s writings, historical insights, and Temple\u2019s magnetic performance. She holds the audience in the palm of her hand\u2014drawing laughter, gasps and breathless silence at all the right moments.\" - Theatreview\n\n\"Thank you for weaving together history, performance, place, music and queer pride into such a special, moving, beautiful experience. There\u2019s nothing like it, it was unforgettable.\" - Audience feedback\n\nPlease note: Katherine Mansfield House & Garden is a modestly-sized historic house. This event will take place throughout the house and most audience members will need to stand for the duration of the show. Unfortunately, the house is not wheelchair accessible and we do not have an accessible bathroom."

    "description": "Whether you\u2019re already retired, or planning ahead, this practical workshop will help you to reflect, re-envision and re-vitalise your life and develop a plan for your future, on your own terms. (NZ citizen and residents free with ID, all others pay $109).\n\nIn your middle years, working, retired or somewhere in between? What\u2019s next? Life is about much more than work or leisure, but most of us have given little thought to what \u201cretirement\u201d might mean.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to speculate what may happen in the future \u2013 but we can be proactive and take control.\nThis course offers insights into how to make the most of our time once we\u2019re less focused on career and/or childrearing. It covers many of the issues people face when considering a move from current employment to a different lifestyle that includes more time to do the things we\u2019ve always promised ourselves we\u2019d do \u2013 \u201cwhen we retire\u201d.\n\nAfter the workshop, you\u2019ll be able to identify a number of common issues and potential ways to manage them when considering and planning your \u201crejuvenation\u201d, rather than a retirement. We won\u2019t cover financial planning, but will focus on some of the personal growth opportunities for living and making a conscious contribution to your community.\n\nBy the end of the day, you\u2019ll have:\n- Developed your own perspective on ageing and retirement in the 21st Century and identified what\u2019s important to you\n- Completed a personal life audit exercise and considered your strengths\n- Explored possibilities in the major aspects of your life and identified potential challenges and strategies for overcoming them\n- Developed a blueprint to maximise the best years of your life and developed a \u201cfuture proofing\u201d downsizing plan\n- Considered options to include a sense of purpose and explored and implemented choices that provide you with that sense of purpose\nBring a pen and paper.\n\n1 day, Sat 9:30 AM \u2013 4:00 PM\nWellington High School\nPresented by Angela Robertson"

She\u2019s graced stages with L.A.B., Fly My Pretties, Neil Finn, and countless others\u2014earning her place as one of New Zealand\u2019s most beloved vocalists.\n\nJoining her is the ever-tasteful guitarist Wade Reeve, whose intuitive playing complements Lisa\u2019s voice with elegance and restraint. If you caught their stunning set at CubaDupa, you already know the magic this duo creates.\n\nMaybe you'll hear Dinah\u2019s most iconic songs\u2014What a Diff\u2019rence a Day Made, Cold, Cold Heart, September in the Rain, and of course, Unforgettable. This afternoon promises to be just that.\n\nCapital Blues Members: $10\nGeneral Admission: $20\nMembers also enjoy 10% off at the bar"
