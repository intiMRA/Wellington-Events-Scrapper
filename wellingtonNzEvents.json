  "description": "This isn\u2019t just any Halloween party. The Andy C Halloween Arena Rave is expecting 4000 partygoers. The bass will be up to 10 at TSB Arena on Wellington\u2019s waterfront for a massive lineup of DJs. United Kingdom drum and bass (DnB) royalty Andy C brings his unique sound back to Aotearoa. He is joined by longtime MC partner Tonn Piper and a stacked lineup of international and national DnB heavyweights. You\u2019ll also see Lee Mvtthews (NZ), S.P.Y (UK), IVY (UK), and Latte & Toxinate.\nThis is a one of a kind full-production arena experience. Expect mind-blowing lighting, spooky visuals, and of course, a world-class sound system.\nAndy C arrives with serious momentum. He\u2019s fresh off a string of sold-out headline shows at Wembley Arena, London\u2019s O2 Arena, and a main stage set at EDC Las Vegas. Andy has collected over 40 Best DJ awards and remains one of the most in demand DJs globally."
