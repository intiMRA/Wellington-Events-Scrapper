    "description": "Recreating three entire classic rock albums live is no easy feat. The crew from Come Together are up for the task \u2014 they have been doing it for five years. The group of famous New Zealand musicians has organised a stellar lineup for 2025. First up they aim to capture the raw emotion of Neil Young\u2019s album \u2018Live Rust\u2019. Later in the year, they\u2019ll tackle the atmospheric complexity of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u2018Dark Side of the Moon\u2019, followed by the thunderous power of Led Zeppelin\u2019s album \u2018Led Zeppelin II\u2019. \nEach of these legendary albums will be performed in its entirety \u2014 track by track, back-to-back. There will also be an additional bonus set of deep cuts and classic hits. Some of the most talented musicians in the country pour everything they have into recreating this music with precision and passion. Look out for Reb Fountain, Jon Toogood, Julia Deans, Luke Buda, Jol Mulholland, and many more. Expect extended solos and spontaneous moments of magic. The electrifying energy between performers makes each show unforgettable."

You don\u2019t have to know how to sing to attend. In fact, creator Astrid Jorgensen assumes you\u2019re not going to be the best or worst singer in the world. She wants all the average people to come, laugh, and learn a song en masse. Pub Choir has been running for eight years now, and Astrid regularly fills big venues with happy punters. Singing together creates an enticing sense of community. \nWhat will happen at the show? Astrid says it\u2019s an entirely improvised, comedy music lesson, where you are the main attraction. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no auditions and no homework. Just bring your voice and we\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d You\u2019ll get taught one song in three-part harmony and have a lot of fun on the way. \nBy purchasing a ticket, you are giving your consent to be filmed and photographed during this show."

Audiences can expect timeless hits including Lonely No More, This Is How A Heart Breaks, Her Diamonds, and Street Corner Symphony. He\u2019ll also be performing new singles as well as Matchbox Twenty favourites like 3am and Unwell. \u201cAfter such amazing Matchbox shows in 2024, it\u2019s so great to revisit the solo catalogue, and I can\u2019t wait to come back and share these songs with my Kiwi fans. It\u2019s going to be a very special run of shows,\u201d said Rob."

Despite being 16 years into her rock career, this is the first album with the band. It shows Sharon\u2019s willingness to continually reinvent herself. The Attachment Theory includes Devra Hoff on bass guitar and backing vocals, Teeny Lieberson on keys, guitar, and backing vocals, and Jorge Balbi on drums. \nSharon\u2019s talent doesn\u2019t stop at just musician and singer-songwriter. She is also an actress. She starred as Rachel in Netflix mystery drama The OA and has appeared in the feature films Never Rarely Sometimes Always and How It Ends."

    "description": "In an exciting and unusual twist to operatic tradition, New Zealand Opera is producing a show where amateurs sing on stage with professionals. \u2018The Monster in the Maze\u2019 retells the myth of the minotaur. The groundbreaking work is community-focused and community-driven. In the performance, community singers and instrumentalists stand shoulder-to-shoulder with their professional counterparts.\nWhen King Minos defeats the Athenians, he decides to punish them by destroying their hope for the future. Every year, the king compels the conquered Athenians to send him their youth. He gives them to the minotaur, a terrible beast at the centre of his island\u2019s maze. The youth are not willing to accept their fate. The story is about resistance, justice, and finding power in collectivism.\n\u2018The Monster in the Maze\u2019 has been praised by audiences, participants, and reviewers worldwide. Its Aotearoa debut season is directed by Anapela Polataivao. Anapela is known for directing the feature movie \u2018Red, White & Brass\u2019 (2023), and live theatre piece \u2018Wild Dogs Under My Skirt\u2019."

He\u2019s heading to Wellington\u2019s Michael Fowler Centre to share his music. The tour will come a few months after the release of his next studio album \u2018Fever Longing Still\u2019. Joining Paul on stage is his band, who help bring these new songs to life. The album title comes from a line in \u2018Sonnet 147\u2019 by Shakespeare, whose writing has thrilled and inspired Paul ever since his school days. \nBestowed with the Order of Australia in 2017 and with 17 ARIA awards and five APRA awards, Paul Kelly is a creative powerhouse. Australia is a constant in his song subjects. He regularly references its geographical landscape, its heroes and villains, and hopes and failings. \nFor the Michael Fowler concert singer/songwriter Reb Fountain will open proceedings. The American-born Kiwi blends folk, art-pop, and rock into her act."

The show takes you on a spellbinding journey through three song eras of one of the most famous singers ever. First up: the sound of the 1950s. Louis Brown will capture the audience with the rockabilly sound and signature dance moves of Elvis\u2019 early career. Arron Walker then takes the mic and recreates the role of Elvis in his movie years in the 1960s.  This period incorporates the singer\u2019s famous straight-out-of-the-army look and the black-leather look. Finally, Steve Michaels pays homage to \u2018Aloha from Hawaii\u2019 \u2014 a famous 1973 concert broadcast across Asia and Oceania. All three performers create a magical atmosphere as befits \u2018The King\u2019. \nThe sound, the moves, and the charm of Elvis Presley are lovingly recreated. Go and see it. It\u2019s now or never."

It might have included popular and classical musicians, singers, dancers, magicians, ventriloquists, strongmen, impersonators, or clowns. \nBritish comedian Bill Bailey is familiar to Wellington audiences. He\u2019s toured several popular stand-up shows to the Michael Fowler Centre. His latest will put his musical and humorous skills to the test. \nAs a versatile musician and comedian, Bill is a modern-day vaudevillian.

Playwrights from international heavy hitters to brilliant Kiwi voices are represented. It also includes programming from comedies and cabarets to contemporary dance and pantomime. \nBefore or after your show, visit the on-site caf\u00e9 brasserie and restaurant, Chouchou. It opens out onto a deck, where you can take it views across the harbour. Look up to admire the art installation above. Called \u2018Velarium\u2019, it undulates in the wind mirroring the water in the harbour. \nCirca Theatre began its life in 1976. A breakaway group of actors and theatre practitioners decided that Aotearoa needed a new and innovative approach to theatre. Five decades later it is still pushing boundaries, making people laugh and cry, and creating theatrical memories. \nIf you don\u2019t have your own Circa memory yet, there\u2019s an opportunity to create one nearly every night of the week."

Kevin Bloody Wilson \u2014 Aussie Icon Tour is set to roll into The Opera House in September. He\u2019ll perform a selection of his funniest songs, and irreverent stories \u2014 all infused with his wickedly rude sense of humour. \nKevin\u2019s journey to politically incorrect stardom started in 1977. He began by changing the words to other people\u2019s songs, eventually writing some songs himself. At the time people were still being arrested for using some four-letter words in public. Audiences initially ostracised him for his rude and crude performances. Now, over 45 years later, the reverse applies. He has 350 million TikTok views, 4 million album sales, and 6 million tickets sold around the world. The 78-year-old shows no signs of slowing down. \u201cThere is just too much political correctness to incorrect!\u201d he says. "

South Africa has won the Rugby World Cup a total of four times while New Zealand has brought it home three times.

The annual festival presents over 150 feature films, short films, and documentaries. \nThere\u2019s always a huge and diverse selection of films to choose from. Artistic Director Paolo Bertolin and his team of film curators have scoured the world for independent, quirky, and award-winning movies. These include a politically charged near-future drama from Brazil, an Australian animated queer space opera, and a restored \u201870s horror classic. There\u2019s also a haunting psychological drama set in remote Aotearoa. \nPaolo says these films are indicative of the energy shaping this year\u2019s festival. They provide a taste of the adventurous and memorable stories awaiting audiences. \u201cThese films speak powerfully to the moment we are living in. They ask big questions, take risks, and remind us why cinema matters more than ever.\u201d"
