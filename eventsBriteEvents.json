  "description": "Tuesday Wellbeing Seminars: Peace Over Panic: Rewiring the Anxious Mind How do we respond when the mind spirals, when uncertainty clouds our judgement, or when we find ourselves at a personal breaking point?\nThis workshop draws from ancient and time-tested wisdom found in yoga philosophy \u2014 especially the Bhagavad Gita \u2014 to explore how anxiety and inner conflict can become turning points for insight and conscious action.\nRather than avoiding or suppressing discomfort, the Gita offers a way to meet it \u2014 with clarity, honesty, and meaningful direction.\nThrough a blend of philosophical reflection and grounded tools, we\u2019ll explore how to steady the mind and reconnect with deeper purpose in the face of pressure or doubt.\nThe seminar will be followed by a delicious plant-based dinner together, all included in your ticket!"

  "description": "Tuesday Wellbeing Seminars: Peace Over Panic: Rewiring the Anxious Mind How do we respond when the mind spirals, when uncertainty clouds our judgement, or when we find ourselves at a personal breaking point?\nThis workshop draws from ancient and time-tested wisdom found in yoga philosophy \u2014 especially the Bhagavad Gita \u2014 to explore how anxiety and inner conflict can become turning points for insight and conscious action.\nRather than avoiding or suppressing discomfort, the Gita offers a way to meet it \u2014 with clarity, honesty, and meaningful direction.\nThrough a blend of philosophical reflection and grounded tools, we\u2019ll explore how to steady the mind and reconnect with deeper purpose in the face of pressure or doubt.\nThe seminar will be followed by a delicious plant-based dinner together, all included in your ticket!"

  "description": "Tuesday Wellbeing Seminars: Peace Over Panic: Rewiring the Anxious Mind How do we respond when the mind spirals, when uncertainty clouds our judgement, or when we find ourselves at a personal breaking point?\nThis workshop draws from ancient and time-tested wisdom found in yoga philosophy \u2014 especially the Bhagavad Gita \u2014 to explore how anxiety and inner conflict can become turning points for insight and conscious action.\nRather than avoiding or suppressing discomfort, the Gita offers a way to meet it \u2014 with clarity, honesty, and meaningful direction.\nThrough a blend of philosophical reflection and grounded tools, we\u2019ll explore how to steady the mind and reconnect with deeper purpose in the face of pressure or doubt.\nThe seminar will be followed by a delicious plant-based dinner together, all included in your ticket!"
